# Cutter

The cutter is a powerful tool that breaks up a text into different "chunks". 
A chunk is a segment of the original text as tokenized by a letter 
(character n-gram) or word (word n-gram) size that is
determined by the user's choices on the cutter page.

Lexos allows the user to choose between 5 different cutting operations:

1. Characters - Characters per segment divides the corpus into segments with a specific
number of characters per segment.

2. Tokens - Tokens(words) per segment divides a text into segments containing
a set number of words(tokens) in each of the segments.

3. Lines - Lines per segment divides a text into segments with a specific
number of lines per segment.

4. Segments/Document - Segments per file divides the corpus into as many segments as the user
specifies.

5. Milestones - Divides the corpus based on a milestone in the document used as a delimiter
between segments in the document.
