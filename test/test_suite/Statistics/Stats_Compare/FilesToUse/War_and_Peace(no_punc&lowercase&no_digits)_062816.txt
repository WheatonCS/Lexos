chapter i

well prince so genoa and lucca are now just family estates of the
buonapartes but i warn you if you dont tell me that this means war
if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that
antichristi really believe he is antichristi will have nothing more to
do with you and you are no longer my friend no longer my faithful
slave as you call yourself but how do you do i see i have frightened
yousit down and tell me all the news

it was in july  and the speaker was the wellknown anna pávlovna
schérer maid of honor and favorite of the empress márya fëdorovna with
these words she greeted prince vasíli kurágin a man of high rank and
importance who was the first to arrive at her reception anna pávlovna
had had a cough for some days she was as she said suffering from la
grippe grippe being then a new word in st petersburg used only by the
elite

all her invitations without exception written in french and delivered
by a scarletliveried footman that morning ran as follows

if you have nothing better to do count or prince and if the
prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible
i shall be very charmed to see you tonight between  and annette
schérer

heavens what a virulent attack replied the prince not in the least
disconcerted by this reception he had just entered wearing an
embroidered court uniform knee breeches and shoes and had stars on
his breast and a serene expression on his flat face he spoke in that
refined french in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought and
with the gentle patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance
who had grown old in society and at court he went up to anna pávlovna
kissed her hand presenting to her his bald scented and shining head
and complacently seated himself on the sofa

first of all dear friend tell me how you are set your friends mind
at rest said he without altering his tone beneath the politeness and
affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be
discerned

can one be well while suffering morally can one be calm in times like
these if one has any feeling said anna pávlovna you are staying the
whole evening i hope

and the fete at the english ambassadors today is wednesday i must
put in an appearance there said the prince my daughter is coming for
me to take me there

i thought todays fete had been canceled i confess all these
festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome

if they had known that you wished it the entertainment would have been
put off said the prince who like a woundup clock by force of habit
said things he did not even wish to be believed

dont tease well and what has been decided about novosíltsevs
dispatch you know everything

what can one say about it replied the prince in a cold listless
tone what has been decided they have decided that buonaparte has
burnt his boats and i believe that we are ready to burn ours

prince vasíli always spoke languidly like an actor repeating a stale
part anna pávlovna schérer on the contrary despite her forty years
overflowed with animation and impulsiveness to be an enthusiast had
become her social vocation and sometimes even when she did not feel
like it she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the
expectations of those who knew her the subdued smile which though it
did not suit her faded features always played round her lips expressed
as in a spoiled child a continual consciousness of her charming defect
which she neither wished nor could nor considered it necessary to
correct

in the midst of a conversation on political matters anna pávlovna burst
out

oh dont speak to me of austria perhaps i dont understand things
but austria never has wished and does not wish for war she is
betraying us russia alone must save europe our gracious sovereign
recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it that is the one
thing i have faith in our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform
the noblest role on earth and he is so virtuous and noble that god will
not forsake him he will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of
revolution which has become more terrible than ever in the person of
this murderer and villain we alone must avenge the blood of the just
one whom i ask you can we rely on england with her commercial
spirit will not and cannot understand the emperor alexanders loftiness
of soul she has refused to evacuate malta she wanted to find and
still seeks some secret motive in our actions what answer did
novosíltsev get none the english have not understood and cannot
understand the selfabnegation of our emperor who wants nothing for
himself but only desires the good of mankind and what have they
promised nothing and what little they have promised they will not
perform prussia has always declared that buonaparte is invincible and
that all europe is powerless before him and i dont believe a word
that hardenburg says or haugwitz either this famous prussian
neutrality is just a trap i have faith only in god and the lofty
destiny of our adored monarch he will save europe

she suddenly paused smiling at her own impetuosity

i think said the prince with a smile that if you had been sent
instead of our dear wintzingerode you would have captured the king of
prussias consent by assault you are so eloquent will you give me a
cup of tea

in a moment à propos she added becoming calm again i am expecting
two very interesting men tonight le vicomte de mortemart who is
connected with the montmorencys through the rohans one of the best
french families he is one of the genuine émigrés the good ones and
also the abbé morio do you know that profound thinker he has been
received by the emperor had you heard

i shall be delighted to meet them said the prince but tell me he
added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him
though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his
visit is it true that the dowager empress wants baron funke to be
appointed first secretary at vienna the baron by all accounts is a poor
creature

prince vasíli wished to obtain this post for his son but others were
trying through the dowager empress márya fëdorovna to secure it for the
baron

anna pávlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor
anyone else had a right to criticize what the empress desired or was
pleased with

baron funke has been recommended to the dowager empress by her sister
was all she said in a dry and mournful tone

as she named the empress anna pávlovnas face suddenly assumed an
expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with
sadness and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious
patroness she added that her majesty had deigned to show baron funke
beaucoup destime and again her face clouded over with sadness

the prince was silent and looked indifferent but with the womanly and
courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her anna pávlovna wished
both to rebuke him for daring to speak as he had done of a man
recommended to the empress and at the same time to console him so she
said

now about your family do you know that since your daughter came out
everyone has been enraptured by her they say she is amazingly
beautiful

the prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude

i often think she continued after a short pause drawing nearer to
the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and
social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate
conversationi often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are
distributed why has fate given you two such splendid children i dont
speak of anatole your youngest i dont like him she added in a tone
admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows two such charming
children and really you appreciate them less than anyone and so you
dont deserve to have them

and she smiled her ecstatic smile

i cant help it said the prince lavater would have said i lack the
bump of paternity

dont joke i mean to have a serious talk with you do you know i am
dissatisfied with your younger son between ourselves and her face
assumed its melancholy expression he was mentioned at her majestys
and you were pitied

the prince answered nothing but she looked at him significantly
awaiting a reply he frowned

what would you have me do he said at last you know i did all a
father could for their education and they have both turned out fools
hippolyte is at least a quiet fool but anatole is an active one that
is the only difference between them he said this smiling in a way more
natural and animated than usual so that the wrinkles round his mouth
very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant

and why are children born to such men as you if you were not a father
there would be nothing i could reproach you with said anna pávlovna
looking up pensively

i am your faithful slave and to you alone i can confess that my
children are the bane of my life it is the cross i have to bear that
is how i explain it to myself it cant be helped

he said no more but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a
gesture anna pávlovna meditated

have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son anatole she
asked they say old maids have a mania for matchmaking and though i
dont feel that weakness in myself as yet i know a little person who is
very unhappy with her father she is a relation of yours princess mary
bolkónskaya

prince vasíli did not reply though with the quickness of memory and
perception befitting a man of the world he indicated by a movement of
the head that he was considering this information

do you know he said at last evidently unable to check the sad
current of his thoughts that anatole is costing me forty thousand
rubles a year and he went on after a pause what will it be in five
years if he goes on like this presently he added thats what we
fathers have to put up with is this princess of yours rich

her father is very rich and stingy he lives in the country he is the
wellknown prince bolkónski who had to retire from the army under the
late emperor and was nicknamed the king of prussia he is very clever
but eccentric and a bore the poor girl is very unhappy she has a
brother i think you know him he married lise meinen lately he is an
aidedecamp of kutúzovs and will be here tonight

listen dear annette said the prince suddenly taking anna pávlovnas
hand and for some reason drawing it downwards arrange that affair for
me and i shall always be your most devoted slaveslafe with an f as a
village elder of mine writes in his reports she is rich and of good
family and thats all i want

and with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him he raised the
maid of honors hand to his lips kissed it and swung it to and fro as
he lay back in his armchair looking in another direction

attendez said anna pávlovna reflecting ill speak to lise young
bolkónskis wife this very evening and perhaps the thing can be
arranged it shall be on your familys behalf that ill start my
apprenticeship as old maid





chapter ii

anna pávlovnas drawing room was gradually filling the highest
petersburg society was assembled there people differing widely in age
and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged
prince vasílis daughter the beautiful hélène came to take her father
to the ambassadors entertainment she wore a ball dress and her badge
as maid of honor the youthful little princess bolkónskaya known as la
femme la plus séduisante de pétersbourg  was also there she had been
married during the previous winter and being pregnant did not go to any
large gatherings but only to small receptions prince vasílis son
hippolyte had come with mortemart whom he introduced the abbé morio
and many others had also come

 the most fascinating woman in petersburg

to each new arrival anna pávlovna said you have not yet seen my aunt
or you do not know my aunt and very gravely conducted him or her to a
little old lady wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap who had come
sailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to arrive and
slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt anna pávlovna
mentioned each ones name and then left them

each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not
one of them knew not one of them wanted to know and not one of them
cared about anna pávlovna observed these greetings with mournful and
solemn interest and silent approval the aunt spoke to each of them in
the same words about their health and her own and the health of her
majesty who thank god was better today and each visitor though
politeness prevented his showing impatience left the old woman with a
sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not return
to her the whole evening

the young princess bolkónskaya had brought some work in a gold
embroidered velvet bag her pretty little upper lip on which a delicate
dark down was just perceptible was too short for her teeth but it
lifted all the more sweetly and was especially charming when she
occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip as is always the case
with a thoroughly attractive woman her defectthe shortness of her
upper lip and her halfopen mouthseemed to be her own special and
peculiar form of beauty everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty
young woman so soon to become a mother so full of life and health and
carrying her burden so lightly old men and dull dispirited young ones
who looked at her after being in her company and talking to her a
little while felt as if they too were becoming like her full of life
and health all who talked to her and at each word saw her bright smile
and the constant gleam of her white teeth thought that they were in a
specially amiable mood that day

the little princess went round the table with quick short swaying
steps her workbag on her arm and gaily spreading out her dress sat
down on a sofa near the silver samovar as if all she was doing was a
pleasure to herself and to all around her i have brought my work
said she in french displaying her bag and addressing all present
mind annette i hope you have not played a wicked trick on me she
added turning to her hostess you wrote that it was to be quite a
small reception and just see how badly i am dressed and she spread
out her arms to show her shortwaisted lacetrimmed dainty gray dress
girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast

soyez tranquille lise you will always be prettier than anyone else
replied anna pávlovna

you know said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in
french turning to a general my husband is deserting me he is going
to get himself killed tell me what this wretched war is for she
added addressing prince vasíli and without waiting for an answer she
turned to speak to his daughter the beautiful hélène

what a delightful woman this little princess is said prince vasíli to
anna pávlovna

one of the next arrivals was a stout heavily built young man with
closecropped hair spectacles the lightcolored breeches fashionable
at that time a very high ruffle and a brown dress coat this stout
young man was an illegitimate son of count bezúkhov a wellknown
grandee of catherines time who now lay dying in moscow the young man
had not yet entered either the military or civil service as he had only
just returned from abroad where he had been educated and this was his
first appearance in society anna pávlovna greeted him with the nod she
accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room but in spite of
this lowestgrade greeting a look of anxiety and fear as at the sight
of something too large and unsuited to the place came over her face
when she saw pierre enter though he was certainly rather bigger than
the other men in the room her anxiety could only have reference to the
clever though shy but observant and natural expression which
distinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room

it is very good of you monsieur pierre to come and visit a poor
invalid said anna pávlovna exchanging an alarmed glance with her aunt
as she conducted him to her

pierre murmured something unintelligible and continued to look round as
if in search of something on his way to the aunt he bowed to the little
princess with a pleased smile as to an intimate acquaintance

anna pávlovnas alarm was justified for pierre turned away from the
aunt without waiting to hear her speech about her majestys health anna
pávlovna in dismay detained him with the words do you know the abbé
morio he is a most interesting man

yes i have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace and it is very
interesting but hardly feasible

you think so rejoined anna pávlovna in order to say something and get
away to attend to her duties as hostess but pierre now committed a
reverse act of impoliteness first he had left a lady before she had
finished speaking to him and now he continued to speak to another who
wished to get away with his head bent and his big feet spread apart
he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbés plan chimerical

we will talk of it later said anna pávlovna with a smile

and having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave she
resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch ready
to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag as the
foreman of a spinning mill when he has set the hands to work goes
round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that
creaks or makes more noise than it should and hastens to check the
machine or set it in proper motion so anna pávlovna moved about her
drawing room approaching now a silent now a toonoisy group and by a
word or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady
proper and regular motion but amid these cares her anxiety about
pierre was evident she kept an anxious watch on him when he approached
the group round mortemart to listen to what was being said there and
again when he passed to another group whose center was the abbé

pierre had been educated abroad and this reception at anna pávlovnas
was the first he had attended in russia he knew that all the
intellectual lights of petersburg were gathered there and like a child
in a toyshop did not know which way to look afraid of missing any
clever conversation that was to be heard seeing the selfconfident and
refined expression on the faces of those present he was always expecting
to hear something very profound at last he came up to morio here the
conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity
to express his own views as young people are fond of doing





chapter iii

anna pávlovnas reception was in full swing the spindles hummed
steadily and ceaselessly on all sides with the exception of the aunt
beside whom sat only one elderly lady who with her thin careworn face
was rather out of place in this brilliant society the whole company had
settled into three groups one chiefly masculine had formed round the
abbé another of young people was grouped round the beautiful princess
hélène prince vasílis daughter and the little princess bolkónskaya
very pretty and rosy though rather too plump for her age the third
group was gathered round mortemart and anna pávlovna

the vicomte was a nicelooking young man with soft features and polished
manners who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of
politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in
which he found himself anna pávlovna was obviously serving him up as a
treat to her guests as a clever maître dhôtel serves up as a specially
choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in the
kitchen would have cared to eat so anna pávlovna served up to her
guests first the vicomte and then the abbé as peculiarly choice
morsels the group about mortemart immediately began discussing the
murder of the duc denghien the vicomte said that the duc denghien had
perished by his own magnanimity and that there were particular reasons
for buonapartes hatred of him

ah yes do tell us all about it vicomte said anna pávlovna with a
pleasant feeling that there was something à la louis xv in the sound of
that sentence contez nous çela vicomte

the vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness to
comply anna pávlovna arranged a group round him inviting everyone to
listen to his tale

the vicomte knew the duc personally whispered anna pávlovna to one of
the guests the vicomte is a wonderful raconteur said she to another
how evidently he belongs to the best society said she to a third and
the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest and most
advantageous style like a wellgarnished joint of roast beef on a hot
dish

the vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile

come over here hélène dear said anna pávlovna to the beautiful
young princess who was sitting some way off the center of another
group

the princess smiled she rose with the same unchanging smile with which
she had first entered the roomthe smile of a perfectly beautiful woman
with a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss and ivy with
a gleam of white shoulders glossy hair and sparkling diamonds she
passed between the men who made way for her not looking at any of them
but smiling on all as if graciously allowing each the privilege of
admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders back and
bosomwhich in the fashion of those days were very much exposedand she
seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as she moved toward
anna pávlovna hélène was so lovely that not only did she not show any
trace of coquetry but on the contrary she even appeared shy of her
unquestionable and all too victorious beauty she seemed to wish but to
be unable to diminish its effect

how lovely said everyone who saw her and the vicomte lifted his
shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinary
when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her
unchanging smile

madame i doubt my ability before such an audience said he smilingly
inclining his head

the princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered
a reply unnecessary she smilingly waited all the time the story was
being told she sat upright glancing now at her beautiful round arm
altered in shape by its pressure on the table now at her still more
beautiful bosom on which she readjusted a diamond necklace from time
to time she smoothed the folds of her dress and whenever the story
produced an effect she glanced at anna pávlovna at once adopted just
the expression she saw on the maid of honors face and again relapsed
into her radiant smile

the little princess had also left the tea table and followed hélène

wait a moment ill get my work now then what are you thinking
of she went on turning to prince hippolyte fetch me my workbag

there was a general movement as the princess smiling and talking
merrily to everyone at once sat down and gaily arranged herself in her
seat

now i am all right she said and asking the vicomte to begin she
took up her work

prince hippolyte having brought the workbag joined the circle and
moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her

le charmant hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance to
his beautiful sister but yet more by the fact that in spite of this
resemblance he was exceedingly ugly his features were like his
sisters but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous self
satisfied youthful and constant smile of animation and by the
wonderful classic beauty of her figure his face on the contrary was
dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen self
confidence while his body was thin and weak his eyes nose and mouth
all seemed puckered into a vacant wearied grimace and his arms and
legs always fell into unnatural positions

its not going to be a ghost story said he sitting down beside the
princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette as if without this
instrument he could not begin to speak

why no my dear fellow said the astonished narrator shrugging his
shoulders

because i hate ghost stories said prince hippolyte in a tone which
showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he had
uttered them

he spoke with such selfconfidence that his hearers could not be sure
whether what he said was very witty or very stupid he was dressed in a
darkgreen dress coat knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe
effrayée as he called it shoes and silk stockings

the vicomte told his tale very neatly it was an anecdote then current
to the effect that the duc denghien had gone secretly to paris to visit
mademoiselle george that at her house he came upon bonaparte who also
enjoyed the famous actress favors and that in his presence napoleon
happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was subject
and was thus at the ducs mercy the latter spared him and this
magnanimity bonaparte subsequently repaid by death

the story was very pretty and interesting especially at the point where
the rivals suddenly recognized one another and the ladies looked
agitated

charming said anna pávlovna with an inquiring glance at the little
princess

charming whispered the little princess sticking the needle into her
work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story
prevented her from going on with it

the vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully
prepared to continue but just then anna pávlovna who had kept a
watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her noticed that he was
talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbé so she hurried to the
rescue pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbé about
the balance of power and the latter evidently interested by the young
mans simpleminded eagerness was explaining his pet theory both were
talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally which was why anna
pávlovna disapproved

the means are  the balance of power in europe and the rights of the
people the abbé was saying it is only necessary for one powerful
nation like russiabarbaric as she is said to beto place herself
disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object the
maintenance of the balance of power of europe and it would save the
world

but how are you to get that balance pierre was beginning

at that moment anna pávlovna came up and looking severely at pierre
asked the italian how he stood russian climate the italians face
instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected sugary
expression evidently habitual to him when conversing with women

i am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the
society more especially of the feminine society in which i have had
the honor of being received that i have not yet had time to think of
the climate said he

not letting the abbé and pierre escape anna pávlovna the more
conveniently to keep them under observation brought them into the
larger circle





chapter iv

just then another visitor entered the drawing room prince andrew
bolkónski the little princess husband he was a very handsome young
man of medium height with firm clearcut features everything about
him from his weary bored expression to his quiet measured step
offered a most striking contrast to his quiet little wife it was
evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room but had
found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to
them and among all these faces that he found so tedious none seemed to
bore him so much as that of his pretty wife he turned away from her
with a grimace that distorted his handsome face kissed anna pávlovnas
hand and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company

you are off to the war prince said anna pávlovna

general kutúzov said bolkónski speaking french and stressing the
last syllable of the generals name like a frenchman has been pleased
to take me as an aidedecamp

and lise your wife

she will go to the country

are you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife

andré said his wife addressing her husband in the same coquettish
manner in which she spoke to other men the vicomte has been telling us
such a tale about mademoiselle george and buonaparte

prince andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away pierre who from the
moment prince andrew entered the room had watched him with glad
affectionate eyes now came up and took his arm before he looked round
prince andrew frowned again expressing his annoyance with whoever was
touching his arm but when he saw pierres beaming face he gave him an
unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile

there now so you too are in the great world said he to pierre

i knew you would be here replied pierre i will come to supper with
you may i he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the vicomte
who was continuing his story

no impossible said prince andrew laughing and pressing pierres
hand to show that there was no need to ask the question he wished to
say something more but at that moment prince vasíli and his daughter
got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass

you must excuse me dear vicomte said prince vasíli to the frenchman
holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent his rising
this unfortunate fete at the ambassadors deprives me of a pleasure
and obliges me to interrupt you i am very sorry to leave your
enchanting party said he turning to anna pávlovna

his daughter princess hélène passed between the chairs lightly
holding up the folds of her dress and the smile shone still more
radiantly on her beautiful face pierre gazed at her with rapturous
almost frightened eyes as she passed him

very lovely said prince andrew

very said pierre

in passing prince vasíli seized pierres hand and said to anna pávlovna
educate this bear for me he has been staying with me a whole month and
this is the first time i have seen him in society nothing is so
necessary for a young man as the society of clever women

anna pávlovna smiled and promised to take pierre in hand she knew his
father to be a connection of prince vasílis the elderly lady who had
been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook prince vasíli
in the anteroom all the affectation of interest she had assumed had
left her kindly and tearworn face and it now expressed only anxiety and
fear

how about my son borís prince said she hurrying after him into the
anteroom i cant remain any longer in petersburg tell me what news i
may take back to my poor boy

although prince vasíli listened reluctantly and not very politely to the
elderly lady even betraying some impatience she gave him an
ingratiating and appealing smile and took his hand that he might not go
away

what would it cost you to say a word to the emperor and then he would
be transferred to the guards at once said she

believe me princess i am ready to do all i can answered prince
vasíli but it is difficult for me to ask the emperor i should advise
you to appeal to rumyántsev through prince golítsyn that would be the
best way

the elderly lady was a princess drubetskáya belonging to one of the
best families in russia but she was poor and having long been out of
society had lost her former influential connections she had now come to
petersburg to procure an appointment in the guards for her only son it
was in fact solely to meet prince vasíli that she had obtained an
invitation to anna pávlovnas reception and had sat listening to the
vicomtes story prince vasílis words frightened her an embittered
look clouded her once handsome face but only for a moment then she
smiled again and clutched prince vasílis arm more tightly

listen to me prince said she i have never yet asked you for
anything and i never will again nor have i ever reminded you of my
fathers friendship for you but now i entreat you for gods sake to do
this for my sonand i shall always regard you as a benefactor she
added hurriedly no dont be angry but promise i have asked golítsyn
and he has refused be the kindhearted man you always were she said
trying to smile though tears were in her eyes

papa we shall be late said princess hélène turning her beautiful
head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she stood
waiting by the door

influence in society however is a capital which has to be economized
if it is to last prince vasíli knew this and having once realized that
if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him he would soon be unable
to ask for himself he became chary of using his influence but in
princess drubetskáyas case he felt after her second appeal something
like qualms of conscience she had reminded him of what was quite true
he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in his career
moreover he could see by her manners that she was one of those
womenmostly motherswho having once made up their minds will not rest
until they have gained their end and are prepared if necessary to go on
insisting day after day and hour after hour and even to make scenes
this last consideration moved him

my dear anna mikháylovna said he with his usual familiarity and
weariness of tone it is almost impossible for me to do what you ask
but to prove my devotion to you and how i respect your fathers memory
i will do the impossibleyour son shall be transferred to the guards
here is my hand on it are you satisfied

my dear benefactor this is what i expected from youi knew your
kindness he turned to go

waitjust a word when he has been transferred to the guards she
faltered you are on good terms with michael ilariónovich kutúzov
recommend borís to him as adjutant then i shall be at rest and
then

prince vasíli smiled

no i wont promise that you dont know how kutúzov is pestered since
his appointment as commander in chief he told me himself that all the
moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as adjutants

no but do promise i wont let you go my dear benefactor

papa said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before we
shall be late

well au revoir goodbye you hear her

then tomorrow you will speak to the emperor

certainly but about kutúzov i dont promise

do promise do promise vasíli cried anna mikháylovna as he went
with the smile of a coquettish girl which at one time probably came
naturally to her but was now very illsuited to her careworn face

apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed all
the old feminine arts but as soon as the prince had gone her face
resumed its former cold artificial expression she returned to the
group where the vicomte was still talking and again pretended to
listen while waiting till it would be time to leave her task was
accomplished





chapter v

and what do you think of this latest comedy the coronation at milan
asked anna pávlovna and of the comedy of the people of genoa and lucca
laying their petitions before monsieur buonaparte and monsieur
buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of the
nations adorable it is enough to make ones head whirl it is as if
the whole world had gone crazy

prince andrew looked anna pávlovna straight in the face with a sarcastic
smile

dieu me la donne gare à qui la touche  they say he was very fine
when he said that he remarked repeating the words in italian dio
mi lha dato guai a chi la tocchi

 god has given it to me let him who touches it beware

i hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run
over anna pávlovna continued the sovereigns will not be able to
endure this man who is a menace to everything

the sovereigns i do not speak of russia said the vicomte polite but
hopeless the sovereigns madame what have they done for louis xvii
for the queen or for madame elizabeth nothing and he became more
animated and believe me they are reaping the reward of their betrayal
of the bourbon cause the sovereigns why they are sending ambassadors
to compliment the usurper

and sighing disdainfully he again changed his position

prince hippolyte who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time
through his lorgnette suddenly turned completely round toward the
little princess and having asked for a needle began tracing the condé
coat of arms on the table he explained this to her with as much gravity
as if she had asked him to do it

bâton de gueules engrêlé de gueules dazurmaison condé said he

the princess listened smiling

if buonaparte remains on the throne of france a year longer the
vicomte continued with the air of a man who in a matter with which he
is better acquainted than anyone else does not listen to others but
follows the current of his own thoughts things will have gone too far
by intrigues violence exile and executions french societyi mean
good french societywill have been forever destroyed and then

he shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands pierre wished to
make a remark for the conversation interested him but anna pávlovna
who had him under observation interrupted

the emperor alexander said she with the melancholy which always
accompanied any reference of hers to the imperial family has declared
that he will leave it to the french people themselves to choose their
own form of government and i believe that once free from the usurper
the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms of its
rightful king she concluded trying to be amiable to the royalist
emigrant

that is doubtful said prince andrew monsieur le vicomte quite
rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far i think it will
be difficult to return to the old regime

from what i have heard said pierre blushing and breaking into the
conversation almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to
bonapartes side

it is the buonapartists who say that replied the vicomte without
looking at pierre at the present time it is difficult to know the real
state of french public opinion

bonaparte has said so remarked prince andrew with a sarcastic smile

it was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his
remarks at him though without looking at him

i showed them the path to glory but they did not follow it prince
andrew continued after a short silence again quoting napoleons words
i opened my antechambers and they crowded in i do not know how far
he was justified in saying so

not in the least replied the vicomte after the murder of the duc
even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero if to some
people he went on turning to anna pávlovna he ever was a hero
after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one
hero less on earth

before anna pávlovna and the others had time to smile their appreciation
of the vicomtes epigram pierre again broke into the conversation and
though anna pávlovna felt sure he would say something inappropriate she
was unable to stop him

the execution of the duc denghien declared monsieur pierre was a
political necessity and it seems to me that napoleon showed greatness
of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole responsibility of
that deed

dieu mon dieu muttered anna pávlovna in a terrified whisper

what monsieur pierre do you consider that assassination shows
greatness of soul said the little princess smiling and drawing her
work nearer to her

oh oh exclaimed several voices

capital said prince hippolyte in english and began slapping his knee
with the palm of his hand

the vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders pierre looked solemnly at his
audience over his spectacles and continued

i say so he continued desperately because the bourbons fled from
the revolution leaving the people to anarchy and napoleon alone
understood the revolution and quelled it and so for the general good
he could not stop short for the sake of one mans life

wont you come over to the other table suggested anna pávlovna

but pierre continued his speech without heeding her

no cried he becoming more and more eager napoleon is great because
he rose superior to the revolution suppressed its abuses preserved all
that was good in itequality of citizenship and freedom of speech and of
the pressand only for that reason did he obtain power

yes if having obtained power without availing himself of it to commit
murder he had restored it to the rightful king i should have called him
a great man remarked the vicomte

he could not do that the people only gave him power that he might rid
them of the bourbons and because they saw that he was a great man the
revolution was a grand thing continued monsieur pierre betraying by
this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme youth and his
wish to express all that was in his mind

what revolution and regicide a grand thing well after that but
wont you come to this other table repeated anna pávlovna

rousseaus contrat social said the vicomte with a tolerant smile

i am not speaking of regicide i am speaking about ideas

yes ideas of robbery murder and regicide again interjected an
ironical voice

those were extremes no doubt but they are not what is most important
what is important are the rights of man emancipation from prejudices
and equality of citizenship and all these ideas napoleon has retained
in full force

liberty and equality said the vicomte contemptuously as if at last
deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words were
highsounding words which have long been discredited who does not love
liberty and equality even our saviour preached liberty and equality
have people since the revolution become happier on the contrary we
wanted liberty but buonaparte has destroyed it

prince andrew kept looking with an amused smile from pierre to the
vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess in the first moment of
pierres outburst anna pávlovna despite her social experience was
horrorstruck but when she saw that pierres sacrilegious words had not
exasperated the vicomte and had convinced herself that it was
impossible to stop him she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in
a vigorous attack on the orator

but my dear monsieur pierre said she how do you explain the fact
of a great man executing a ducor even an ordinary man whois innocent
and untried

i should like said the vicomte to ask how monsieur explains the
th brumaire was not that an imposture it was a swindle and not at
all like the conduct of a great man

and the prisoners he killed in africa that was horrible said the
little princess shrugging her shoulders

hes a low fellow say what you will remarked prince hippolyte

pierre not knowing whom to answer looked at them all and smiled his
smile was unlike the halfsmile of other people when he smiled his
grave even rather gloomy look was instantaneously replaced by
anothera childlike kindly even rather silly look which seemed to ask
forgiveness

the vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that this
young jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested all were
silent

how do you expect him to answer you all at once said prince andrew
besides in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish between
his acts as a private person as a general and as an emperor so it
seems to me

yes yes of course pierre chimed in pleased at the arrival of this
reinforcement

one must admit continued prince andrew that napoleon as a man was
great on the bridge of arcola and in the hospital at jaffa where he
gave his hand to the plaguestricken but  but there are other acts
which it is difficult to justify

prince andrew who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of
pierres remarks rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to
go

suddenly prince hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend
and asking them all to be seated began

i was told a charming moscow story today and must treat you to it
excuse me vicomtei must tell it in russian or the point will be
lost and prince hippolyte began to tell his story in such russian
as a frenchman would speak after spending about a year in russia
everyone waited so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their
attention to his story

there is in moscow a lady une dame and she is very stingy she must
have two footmen behind her carriage and very big ones that was her
taste and she had a ladys maid also big she said

here prince hippolyte paused evidently collecting his ideas with
difficulty

she said oh yes she said girl to the maid put on a livery
get up behind the carriage and come with me while i make some calls

here prince hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his
audience which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator several
persons among them the elderly lady and anna pávlovna did however
smile

she went suddenly there was a great wind the girl lost her hat and
her long hair came down here he could contain himself no longer and
went on between gasps of laughter and the whole world knew

and so the anecdote ended though it was unintelligible why he had told
it or why it had to be told in russian still anna pávlovna and the
others appreciated prince hippolytes social tact in so agreeably ending
pierres unpleasant and unamiable outburst after the anecdote the
conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last and
next balls about theatricals and who would meet whom and when and
where





chapter vi

having thanked anna pávlovna for her charming soiree the guests began
to take their leave

pierre was ungainly stout about the average height broad with huge
red hands he did not know as the saying is how to enter a drawing
room and still less how to leave one that is how to say something
particularly agreeable before going away besides this he was absent
minded when he rose to go he took up instead of his own the generals
threecornered hat and held it pulling at the plume till the general
asked him to restore it all his absentmindedness and inability to
enter a room and converse in it was however redeemed by his kindly
simple and modest expression anna pávlovna turned toward him and with
a christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his indiscretion
nodded and said i hope to see you again but i also hope you will
change your opinions my dear monsieur pierre

when she said this he did not reply and only bowed but again everybody
saw his smile which said nothing unless perhaps opinions are
opinions but you see what a capital goodnatured fellow i am and
everyone including anna pávlovna felt this

prince andrew had gone out into the hall and turning his shoulders to
the footman who was helping him on with his cloak listened
indifferently to his wifes chatter with prince hippolyte who had also
come into the hall prince hippolyte stood close to the pretty pregnant
princess and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass

go in annette or you will catch cold said the little princess
taking leave of anna pávlovna it is settled she added in a low
voice

anna pávlovna had already managed to speak to lise about the match she
contemplated between anatole and the little princess sisterinlaw

i rely on you my dear said anna pávlovna also in a low tone write
to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter au revoir
and she left the hall

prince hippolyte approached the little princess and bending his face
close to her began to whisper something

two footmen the princess and his own stood holding a shawl and a
cloak waiting for the conversation to finish they listened to the
french sentences which to them were meaningless with an air of
understanding but not wishing to appear to do so the princess as usual
spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh

i am very glad i did not go to the ambassadors said prince hippolyte
so dull it has been a delightful evening has it not delightful

they say the ball will be very good replied the princess drawing up
her downy little lip all the pretty women in society will be there

not all for you will not be there not all said prince hippolyte
smiling joyfully and snatching the shawl from the footman whom he even
pushed aside he began wrapping it round the princess either from
awkwardness or intentionally no one could have said which after the
shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time as
though embracing her

still smiling she gracefully moved away turning and glancing at her
husband prince andrews eyes were closed so weary and sleepy did he
seem

are you ready he asked his wife looking past her

prince hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak which in the latest fashion
reached to his very heels and stumbling in it ran out into the porch
following the princess whom a footman was helping into the carriage

princesse au revoir cried he stumbling with his tongue as well as
with his feet

the princess picking up her dress was taking her seat in the dark
carriage her husband was adjusting his saber prince hippolyte under
pretense of helping was in everyones way

allow me sir said prince andrew in russian in a cold disagreeable
tone to prince hippolyte who was blocking his path

i am expecting you pierre said the same voice but gently and
affectionately

the postilion started the carriage wheels rattled prince hippolyte
laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte
whom he had promised to take home

well mon cher said the vicomte having seated himself beside
hippolyte in the carriage your little princess is very nice very nice
indeed quite french and he kissed the tips of his fingers hippolyte
burst out laughing

do you know you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs
continued the vicomte i pity the poor husband that little officer who
gives himself the airs of a monarch

hippolyte spluttered again and amid his laughter said and you were
saying that the russian ladies are not equal to the french one has to
know how to deal with them

pierre reaching the house first went into prince andrews study like one
quite at home and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa took
from the shelf the first book that came to his hand it was caesars
commentaries and resting on his elbow began reading it in the middle

what have you done to mlle schérer she will be quite ill now said
prince andrew as he entered the study rubbing his small white hands

pierre turned his whole body making the sofa creak he lifted his eager
face to prince andrew smiled and waved his hand

that abbé is very interesting but he does not see the thing in the
right light in my opinion perpetual peace is possible buti do not
know how to express it  not by a balance of political power

it was evident that prince andrew was not interested in such abstract
conversation

one cant everywhere say all one thinks mon cher well have you at
last decided on anything are you going to be a guardsman or a
diplomatist asked prince andrew after a momentary silence

pierre sat up on the sofa with his legs tucked under him

really i dont yet know i dont like either the one or the other

but you must decide on something your father expects it

pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbé as tutor and
had remained away till he was twenty when he returned to moscow his
father dismissed the abbé and said to the young man now go to
petersburg look round and choose your profession i will agree to
anything here is a letter to prince vasíli and here is money write to
me all about it and i will help you in everything pierre had already
been choosing a career for three months and had not decided on
anything it was about this choice that prince andrew was speaking
pierre rubbed his forehead

but he must be a freemason said he referring to the abbé whom he had
met that evening

that is all nonsense prince andrew again interrupted him let us
talk business have you been to the horse guards

no i have not but this is what i have been thinking and wanted to
tell you there is a war now against napoleon if it were a war for
freedom i could understand it and should be the first to enter the army
but to help england and austria against the greatest man in the world is
not right

prince andrew only shrugged his shoulders at pierres childish words he
put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such nonsense
but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other answer than
the one prince andrew gave to this naïve question

if no one fought except on his own conviction there would be no wars
he said

and that would be splendid said pierre

prince andrew smiled ironically

very likely it would be splendid but it will never come about

well why are you going to the war asked pierre

what for i dont know i must besides that i am going he paused
i am going because the life i am leading here does not suit me





chapter vii

the rustle of a womans dress was heard in the next room prince andrew
shook himself as if waking up and his face assumed the look it had had
in anna pávlovnas drawing room pierre removed his feet from the sofa
the princess came in she had changed her gown for a house dress as
fresh and elegant as the other prince andrew rose and politely placed a
chair for her

how is it she began as usual in french settling down briskly and
fussily in the easy chair how is it annette never got married how
stupid you men all are not to have married her excuse me for saying so
but you have no sense about women what an argumentative fellow you are
monsieur pierre

and i am still arguing with your husband i cant understand why he
wants to go to the war replied pierre addressing the princess with
none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their
intercourse with young women

the princess started evidently pierres words touched her to the quick

ah that is just what i tell him said she i dont understand it i
dont in the least understand why men cant live without wars how is it
that we women dont want anything of the kind dont need it now you
shall judge between us i always tell him here he is uncles aidede
camp a most brilliant position he is so well known so much
appreciated by everyone the other day at the apráksins i heard a lady
asking is that the famous prince andrew i did indeed she laughed
he is so well received everywhere he might easily become aidedecamp
to the emperor you know the emperor spoke to him most graciously
annette and i were speaking of how to arrange it what do you think

pierre looked at his friend and noticing that he did not like the
conversation gave no reply

when are you starting he asked

oh dont speak of his going dont i wont hear it spoken of said
the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which she had spoken
to hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly illsuited to
the family circle of which pierre was almost a member today when i
remembered that all these delightful associations must be broken off
and then you know andre she looked significantly at her husband
im afraid im afraid she whispered and a shudder ran down her
back

her husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone besides
pierre and himself was in the room and addressed her in a tone of
frigid politeness

what is it you are afraid of lise i dont understand said he

there what egotists men all are all all egotists just for a whim of
his own goodness only knows why he leaves me and locks me up alone in
the country

with my father and sister remember said prince andrew gently

alone all the same without my friends and he expects me not to be
afraid

her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up giving her not a
joyful but an animal squirrellike expression she paused as if she
felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before pierre though the
gist of the matter lay in that

i still cant understand what you are afraid of said prince andrew
slowly not taking his eyes off his wife

the princess blushed and raised her arms with a gesture of despair

no andrew i must say you have changed oh how you have

your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier said prince andrew you
had better go

the princess said nothing but suddenly her short downy lip quivered
prince andrew rose shrugged his shoulders and walked about the room

pierre looked over his spectacles with naïve surprise now at him and
now at her moved as if about to rise too but changed his mind

why should i mind monsieur pierre being here exclaimed the little
princess suddenly her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful
grimace i have long wanted to ask you andrew why you have changed so
to me what have i done to you you are going to the war and have no
pity for me why is it

lise was all prince andrew said but that one word expressed an
entreaty a threat and above all conviction that she would herself
regret her words but she went on hurriedly

you treat me like an invalid or a child i see it all did you behave
like that six months ago

lise i beg you to desist said prince andrew still more emphatically

pierre who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to
all this rose and approached the princess he seemed unable to bear the
sight of tears and was ready to cry himself

calm yourself princess it seems so to you because i assure you i
myself have experienced  and so  because  no excuse me an
outsider is out of place here no dont distress yourself good
bye

prince andrew caught him by the hand

no wait pierre the princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of the
pleasure of spending the evening with you

no he thinks only of himself muttered the princess without
restraining her angry tears

lise said prince andrew dryly raising his voice to the pitch which
indicates that patience is exhausted

suddenly the angry squirrellike expression of the princess pretty
face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear her beautiful eyes
glanced askance at her husbands face and her own assumed the timid
deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its
drooping tail

mon dieu mon dieu she muttered and lifting her dress with one hand
she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead

good night lise said he rising and courteously kissing her hand as
he would have done to a stranger





chapter viii

the friends were silent neither cared to begin talking pierre
continually glanced at prince andrew prince andrew rubbed his forehead
with his small hand

let us go and have supper he said with a sigh going to the door

they entered the elegant newly decorated and luxurious dining room
everything from the table napkins to the silver china and glass bore
that imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married
halfway through supper prince andrew leaned his elbows on the table and
with a look of nervous agitation such as pierre had never before seen on
his face began to talkas one who has long had something on his mind
and suddenly determines to speak out

never never marry my dear fellow thats my advice never marry till
you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of and
until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen her
plainly as she is or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable
mistake marry when you are old and good for nothingor all that is good
and noble in you will be lost it will all be wasted on trifles yes
yes yes dont look at me with such surprise if you marry expecting
anything from yourself in the future you will feel at every step that
for you all is ended all is closed except the drawing room where you
will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an idiot but
whats the good and he waved his arm

pierre took off his spectacles which made his face seem different and
the goodnatured expression still more apparent and gazed at his friend
in amazement

my wife continued prince andrew is an excellent woman one of those
rare women with whom a mans honor is safe but o god what would i not
give now to be unmarried you are the first and only one to whom i
mention this because i like you

as he said this prince andrew was less than ever like that bolkónski who
had lolled in anna pávlovnas easy chairs and with halfclosed eyes had
uttered french phrases between his teeth every muscle of his thin face
was now quivering with nervous excitement his eyes in which the fire
of life had seemed extinguished now flashed with brilliant light it
was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary times the more
impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid irritation

you dont understand why i say this he continued but it is the
whole story of life you talk of bonaparte and his career said he
though pierre had not mentioned bonaparte but bonaparte when he
worked went step by step toward his goal he was free he had nothing
but his aim to consider and he reached it but tie yourself up with a
woman and like a chained convict you lose all freedom and all you
have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with
regret drawing rooms gossip balls vanity and trivialitythese are
the enchanted circle i cannot escape from i am now going to the war
the greatest war there ever was and i know nothing and am fit for
nothing i am very amiable and have a caustic wit continued prince
andrew and at anna pávlovnas they listen to me and that stupid set
without whom my wife cannot exist and those women if you only knew
what those society women are and women in general my father is right
selfish vain stupid trivial in everythingthats what women are when
you see them in their true colors when you meet them in society it
seems as if there were something in them but theres nothing nothing
nothing no dont marry my dear fellow dont marry concluded prince
andrew

it seems funny to me said pierre that you you should consider
yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life you have everything
before you everything and you

he did not finish his sentence but his tone showed how highly he
thought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future

how can he talk like that thought pierre he considered his friend a
model of perfection because prince andrew possessed in the highest
degree just the very qualities pierre lacked and which might be best
described as strength of will pierre was always astonished at prince
andrews calm manner of treating everybody his extraordinary memory
his extensive reading he had read everything knew everything and had
an opinion about everything but above all at his capacity for work and
study and if pierre was often struck by andrews lack of capacity for
philosophical meditation to which he himself was particularly
addicted he regarded even this not as a defect but as a sign of
strength

even in the best most friendly and simplest relations of life praise
and commendation are essential just as grease is necessary to wheels
that they may run smoothly

my part is played out said prince andrew whats the use of talking
about me let us talk about you he added after a silence smiling at
his reassuring thoughts

that smile was immediately reflected on pierres face

but what is there to say about me said pierre his face relaxing into
a careless merry smile what am i an illegitimate son he suddenly
blushed crimson and it was plain that he had made a great effort to say
this without a name and without means and it really but he did
not say what it really was for the present i am free and am all
right only i havent the least idea what i am to do i wanted to
consult you seriously

prince andrew looked kindly at him yet his glancefriendly and
affectionate as it wasexpressed a sense of his own superiority

i am fond of you especially as you are the one live man among our
whole set yes youre all right choose what you will its all the
same youll be all right anywhere but look here give up visiting
those kurágins and leading that sort of life it suits you so badlyall
this debauchery dissipation and the rest of it

what would you have my dear fellow answered pierre shrugging his
shoulders women my dear fellow women

i dont understand it replied prince andrew women who are comme il
faut thats a different matter but the kurágins set of women women
and wine i dont understand

pierre was staying at prince vasíli kurágins and sharing the dissipated
life of his son anatole the son whom they were planning to reform by
marrying him to prince andrews sister

do you know said pierre as if suddenly struck by a happy thought
seriously i have long been thinking of it leading such a life i
cant decide or think properly about anything ones head aches and one
spends all ones money he asked me for tonight but i wont go

you give me your word of honor not to go

on my honor





chapter ix

it was past one oclock when pierre left his friend it was a cloudless
northern summer night pierre took an open cab intending to drive
straight home but the nearer he drew to the house the more he felt the
impossibility of going to sleep on such a night it was light enough to
see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like morning or
evening than night on the way pierre remembered that anatole kurágin
was expecting the usual set for cards that evening after which there
was generally a drinking bout finishing with visits of a kind pierre
was very fond of

i should like to go to kurágins thought he

but he immediately recalled his promise to prince andrew not to go
there then as happens to people of weak character he desired so
passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to
that he decided to go the thought immediately occurred to him that his
promise to prince andrew was of no account because before he gave it he
had already promised prince anatole to come to his gathering besides
thought he all such words of honor are conventional things with no
definite meaning especially if one considers that by tomorrow one may
be dead or something so extraordinary may happen to one that honor and
dishonor will be all the same pierre often indulged in reflections of
this sort nullifying all his decisions and intentions he went to
kurágins

reaching the large house near the horse guards barracks in which
anatole lived pierre entered the lighted porch ascended the stairs
and went in at the open door there was no one in the anteroom empty
bottles cloaks and overshoes were lying about there was a smell of
alcohol and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance

cards and supper were over but the visitors had not yet dispersed
pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room in which were the
remains of supper a footman thinking no one saw him was drinking on
the sly what was left in the glasses from the third room came sounds of
laughter the shouting of familiar voices the growling of a bear and
general commotion some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously
round an open window three others were romping with a young bear one
pulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the others

i bet a hundred on stevens shouted one

mind no holding on cried another

i bet on dólokhov cried a third kurágin you part our hands

there leave bruin alone heres a bet on

at one draught or he loses shouted a fourth

jacob bring a bottle shouted the host a tall handsome fellow who
stood in the midst of the group without a coat and with his fine linen
shirt unfastened in front wait a bit you fellows here is pétya
good man cried he addressing pierre

another voice from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes
particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober ring
cried from the window come here part the bets this was dólokhov an
officer of the semënov regiment a notorious gambler and duelist who
was living with anatole pierre smiled looking about him merrily

i dont understand whats it all about

wait a bit he is not drunk yet a bottle here said anatole taking a
glass from the table he went up to pierre

first of all you must drink

pierre drank one glass after another looking from under his brows at
the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window and listening
to their chatter anatole kept on refilling pierres glass while
explaining that dólokhov was betting with stevens an english naval
officer that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge
of the third floor window with his legs hanging out

go on you must drink it all said anatole giving pierre the last
glass or i wont let you go

no i wont said pierre pushing anatole aside and he went up to the
window

dólokhov was holding the englishmans hand and clearly and distinctly
repeating the terms of the bet addressing himself particularly to
anatole and pierre

dólokhov was of medium height with curly hair and lightblue eyes he
was about twentyfive like all infantry officers he wore no mustache
so that his mouth the most striking feature of his face was clearly
seen the lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved the middle
of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm
lower one and something like two distinct smiles played continually
round the two corners of the mouth this together with the resolute
insolent intelligence of his eyes produced an effect which made it
impossible not to notice his face dólokhov was a man of small means and
no connections yet though anatole spent tens of thousands of rubles
dólokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a footing that
all who knew them including anatole himself respected him more than
they did anatole dólokhov could play all games and nearly always won
however much he drank he never lost his clearheadedness both kurágin
and dólokhov were at that time notorious among the rakes and scapegraces
of petersburg

the bottle of rum was brought the window frame which prevented anyone
from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen who
were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of
the gentlemen around

anatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window he wanted to
smash something pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame but
could not move it he smashed a pane

you have a try hercules said he turning to pierre

pierre seized the crossbeam tugged and wrenched the oak frame out with
a crash

take it right out or theyll think im holding on said dólokhov

is the englishman bragging eh is it all right said anatole

firstrate said pierre looking at dólokhov who with a bottle of rum
in his hand was approaching the window from which the light of the sky
the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset was visible

dólokhov the bottle of rum still in his hand jumped onto the window
sill listen cried he standing there and addressing those in the
room all were silent

i bet fifty imperialshe spoke french that the englishman might
understand him but he did not speak it very welli bet fifty imperials
 or do you wish to make it a hundred added he addressing the
englishman

no fifty replied the latter

all right fifty imperials  that i will drink a whole bottle of rum
without taking it from my mouth sitting outside the window on this
spot he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window
and without holding on to anything is that right

quite right said the englishman

anatole turned to the englishman and taking him by one of the buttons of
his coat and looking down at himthe englishman was shortbegan
repeating the terms of the wager to him in english

wait cried dólokhov hammering with the bottle on the window sill to
attract attention wait a bit kurágin listen if anyone else does the
same i will pay him a hundred imperials do you understand

the englishman nodded but gave no indication whether he intended to
accept this challenge or not anatole did not release him and though he
kept nodding to show that he understood anatole went on translating
dólokhovs words into english a thin young lad an hussar of the life
guards who had been losing that evening climbed on the window sill
leaned over and looked down

oh oh oh he muttered looking down from the window at the stones of
the pavement

shut up cried dólokhov pushing him away from the window the lad
jumped awkwardly back into the room tripping over his spurs

placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily
dólokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered his
legs pressing against both sides of the window he adjusted himself on
his seat lowered his hands moved a little to the right and then to the
left and took up the bottle anatole brought two candles and placed
them on the window sill though it was already quite light dólokhovs
back in his white shirt and his curly head were lit up from both
sides everyone crowded to the window the englishman in front pierre
stood smiling but silent one man older than the others present
suddenly pushed forward with a scared and angry look and wanted to seize
hold of dólokhovs shirt

i say this is folly hell be killed said this more sensible man

anatole stopped him

dont touch him youll startle him and then hell be killed eh
what then eh

dólokhov turned round and again holding on with both hands arranged
himself on his seat

if anyone comes meddling again said he emitting the words separately
through his thin compressed lips i will throw him down there now
then

saying this he again turned round dropped his hands took the bottle
and lifted it to his lips threw back his head and raised his free hand
to balance himself one of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some
broken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the
window and from dólokhovs back anatole stood erect with staring eyes
the englishman looked on sideways pursing up his lips the man who had
wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw himself
on a sofa with his face to the wall pierre hid his face from which a
faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed horror and
fear all were still pierre took his hands from his eyes dólokhov
still sat in the same position only his head was thrown further back
till his curly hair touched his shirt collar and the hand holding the
bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the effort the
bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher and his head
tilting yet further back why is it so long thought pierre it seemed
to him that more than half an hour had elapsed suddenly dólokhov made a
backward movement with his spine and his arm trembled nervously this
was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the sloping
ledge as he began slipping down his head and arm wavered still more
with the strain one hand moved as if to clutch the window sill but
refrained from touching it pierre again covered his eyes and thought he
would never open them again suddenly he was aware of a stir all around
he looked up dólokhov was standing on the window sill with a pale but
radiant face

its empty

he threw the bottle to the englishman who caught it neatly dólokhov
jumped down he smelt strongly of rum

well done fine fellow theres a bet for you devil take
you came from different sides

the englishman took out his purse and began counting out the money
dólokhov stood frowning and did not speak pierre jumped upon the window
sill

gentlemen who wishes to bet with me ill do the same thing he
suddenly cried even without a bet there tell them to bring me a
bottle ill do it bring a bottle

let him do it let him do it said dólokhov smiling

what next have you gone mad no one would let you why you go
giddy even on a staircase exclaimed several voices

ill drink it lets have a bottle of rum shouted pierre banging the
table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to climb out
of the window

they seized him by his arms but he was so strong that everyone who
touched him was sent flying

no youll never manage him that way said anatole wait a bit and
ill get round him listen ill take your bet tomorrow but now we
are all going to s

come on then cried pierre come on and well take bruin with
us

and he caught the bear took it in his arms lifted it from the ground
and began dancing round the room with it





chapter x

prince vasíli kept the promise he had given to princess drubetskáya who
had spoken to him on behalf of her only son borís on the evening of anna
pávlovnas soiree the matter was mentioned to the emperor an exception
made and borís transferred into the regiment of semënov guards with the
rank of cornet he received however no appointment to kutúzovs staff
despite all anna mikháylovnas endeavors and entreaties soon after anna
pávlovnas reception anna mikháylovna returned to moscow and went
straight to her rich relations the rostóvs with whom she stayed when
in the town and where her darling bóry who had only just entered a
regiment of the line and was being at once transferred to the guards as
a cornet had been educated from childhood and lived for years at a
time the guards had already left petersburg on the tenth of august and
her son who had remained in moscow for his equipment was to join them
on the march to radzivílov

it was st natalias day and the name day of two of the rostóvsthe
mother and the youngest daughterboth named nataly ever since the
morning carriages with six horses had been coming and going
continually bringing visitors to the countess rostóvas big house on
the povarskáya so well known to all moscow the countess herself and
her handsome eldest daughter were in the drawing room with the visitors
who came to congratulate and who constantly succeeded one another in
relays

the countess was a woman of about fortyfive with a thin oriental type
of face evidently worn out with childbearingshe had had twelve a
languor of motion and speech resulting from weakness gave her a
distinguished air which inspired respect princess anna mikháylovna
drubetskáya who as a member of the household was also seated in the
drawing room helped to receive and entertain the visitors the young
people were in one of the inner rooms not considering it necessary to
take part in receiving the visitors the count met the guests and saw
them off inviting them all to dinner

i am very very grateful to you mon cher or ma chèrehe called
everyone without exception and without the slightest variation in his
tone my dear whether they were above or below him in ranki thank
you for myself and for our two dear ones whose name day we are keeping
but mind you come to dinner or i shall be offended ma chère on behalf
of the whole family i beg you to come mon cher these words he
repeated to everyone without exception or variation and with the same
expression on his full cheerful cleanshaven face the same firm
pressure of the hand and the same quick repeated bows as soon as he
had seen a visitor off he returned to one of those who were still in the
drawing room drew a chair toward him or her and jauntily spreading out
his legs and putting his hands on his knees with the air of a man who
enjoys life and knows how to live he swayed to and fro with dignity
offered surmises about the weather or touched on questions of health
sometimes in russian and sometimes in very bad but selfconfident
french then again like a man weary but unflinching in the fulfillment
of duty he rose to see some visitors off and stroking his scanty gray
hairs over his bald patch also asked them to dinner sometimes on his
way back from the anteroom he would pass through the conservatory and
pantry into the large marble dining hall where tables were being set
out for eighty people and looking at the footmen who were bringing in
silver and china moving tables and unfolding damask table linen he
would call dmítri vasílevich a man of good family and the manager of
all his affairs and while looking with pleasure at the enormous table
would say well dmítri youll see that things are all as they should
be thats right the great thing is the serving thats it and with a
complacent sigh he would return to the drawing room

márya lvóvna karágina and her daughter announced the countess
gigantic footman in his bass voice entering the drawing room the
countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold snuffbox with
her husbands portrait on it

im quite worn out by these callers however ill see her and no more
she is so affected ask her in she said to the footman in a sad voice
as if saying very well finish me off

a tall stout and proudlooking woman with a roundfaced smiling
daughter entered the drawing room their dresses rustling

dear countess what an age she has been laid up poor child  at
the razumóvskis ball  and countess apráksina  i was so
delighted came the sounds of animated feminine voices interrupting
one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and the scraping
of chairs then one of those conversations began which last out until
at the first pause the guests rise with a rustle of dresses and say i
am so delighted mammas health and countess apráksina and
then again rustling pass into the anteroom put on cloaks or mantles
and drive away the conversation was on the chief topic of the day the
illness of the wealthy and celebrated beau of catherines day count
bezúkhov and about his illegitimate son pierre the one who had behaved
so improperly at anna pávlovnas reception

i am so sorry for the poor count said the visitor he is in such bad
health and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill him

what is that asked the countess as if she did not know what the
visitor alluded to though she had already heard about the cause of
count bezúkhovs distress some fifteen times

thats what comes of a modern education exclaimed the visitor it
seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as he
liked now in petersburg i hear he has been doing such terrible things
that he has been expelled by the police

you dont say so replied the countess

he chose his friends badly interposed anna mikháylovna prince
vasílis son he and a certain dólokhov have it is said been up to
heaven only knows what and they have had to suffer for it dólokhov has
been degraded to the ranks and bezúkhovs son sent back to moscow
anatole kurágins father managed somehow to get his sons affair hushed
up but even he was ordered out of petersburg

but what have they been up to asked the countess

they are regular brigands especially dólokhov replied the visitor
he is a son of márya ivánovna dólokhova such a worthy woman but
there just fancy those three got hold of a bear somewhere put it in a
carriage and set off with it to visit some actresses the police tried
to interfere and what did the young men do they tied a policeman and
the bear back to back and put the bear into the moyka canal and there
was the bear swimming about with the policeman on his back

what a nice figure the policeman must have cut my dear shouted the
count dying with laughter

oh how dreadful how can you laugh at it count

yet the ladies themselves could not help laughing

it was all they could do to rescue the poor man continued the
visitor and to think it is cyril vladímirovich bezúkhovs son who
amuses himself in this sensible manner and he was said to be so well
educated and clever this is all that his foreign education has done for
him i hope that here in moscow no one will receive him in spite of his
money they wanted to introduce him to me but i quite declined i have
my daughters to consider

why do you say this young man is so rich asked the countess turning
away from the girls who at once assumed an air of inattention his
children are all illegitimate i think pierre also is illegitimate

the visitor made a gesture with her hand

i should think he has a score of them

princess anna mikháylovna intervened in the conversation evidently
wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went on in
society

the fact of the matter is said she significantly and also in a half
whisper everyone knows count cyrils reputation he has lost count
of his children but this pierre was his favorite

how handsome the old man still was only a year ago remarked the
countess i have never seen a handsomer man

he is very much altered now said anna mikháylovna well as i was
saying prince vasíli is the next heir through his wife but the count
is very fond of pierre looked after his education and wrote to the
emperor about him so that in the case of his deathand he is so ill
that he may die at any moment and dr lorrain has come from
petersburgno one knows who will inherit his immense fortune pierre or
prince vasíli forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles i know it
all very well for prince vasíli told me himself besides cyril
vladímirovich is my mothers second cousin hes also my bórys
godfather she added as if she attached no importance at all to the
fact

prince vasíli arrived in moscow yesterday i hear he has come on some
inspection business remarked the visitor

yes but between ourselves said the princess that is a pretext the
fact is he has come to see count cyril vladímirovich hearing how ill he
is

but do you know my dear that was a capital joke said the count and
seeing that the elder visitor was not listening he turned to the young
ladies i can just imagine what a funny figure that policeman cut

and as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman his portly form
again shook with a deep ringing laugh the laugh of one who always eats
well and in particular drinks well so do come and dine with us he
said





chapter xi

silence ensued the countess looked at her callers smiling affably but
not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they now
rose and took their leave the visitors daughter was already smoothing
down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother when suddenly from
the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls running to the
door and the noise of a chair falling over and a girl of thirteen
hiding something in the folds of her short muslin frock darted in and
stopped short in the middle of the room it was evident that she had not
intended her flight to bring her so far behind her in the doorway
appeared a student with a crimson coat collar an officer of the guards
a girl of fifteen and a plump rosyfaced boy in a short jacket

the count jumped up and swaying from side to side spread his arms wide
and threw them round the little girl who had run in

ah here she is he exclaimed laughing my pet whose name day it is
my dear pet

ma chère there is a time for everything said the countess with
feigned severity you spoil her ilyá she added turning to her
husband

how do you do my dear i wish you many happy returns of your name
day said the visitor what a charming child she added addressing
the mother

this blackeyed widemouthed girl not pretty but full of lifewith
childish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her bodice
with black curls tossed backward thin bare arms little legs in lace
frilled drawers and feet in low slipperswas just at that charming age
when a girl is no longer a child though the child is not yet a young
woman escaping from her father she ran to hide her flushed face in the
lace of her mothers mantillanot paying the least attention to her
severe remarkand began to laugh she laughed and in fragmentary
sentences tried to explain about a doll which she produced from the
folds of her frock

do you see my doll mimi you see was all natásha managed
to utter to her everything seemed funny she leaned against her mother
and burst into such a loud ringing fit of laughter that even the prim
visitor could not help joining in

now then go away and take your monstrosity with you said the mother
pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness and turning to the
visitor she added she is my youngest girl

natásha raising her face for a moment from her mothers mantilla
glanced up at her through tears of laughter and again hid her face

the visitor compelled to look on at this family scene thought it
necessary to take some part in it

tell me my dear said she to natásha is mimi a relation of yours a
daughter i suppose

natásha did not like the visitors tone of condescension to childish
things she did not reply but looked at her seriously

meanwhile the younger generation borís the officer anna mikháylovnas
son nicholas the undergraduate the counts eldest son sónya the
counts fifteenyearold niece and little pétya his youngest boy had
all settled down in the drawing room and were obviously trying to
restrain within the bounds of decorum the excitement and mirth that
shone in all their faces evidently in the back rooms from which they
had dashed out so impetuously the conversation had been more amusing
than the drawing room talk of society scandals the weather and
countess apráksina now and then they glanced at one another hardly
able to suppress their laughter

the two young men the student and the officer friends from childhood
were of the same age and both handsome fellows though not alike borís
was tall and fair and his calm and handsome face had regular delicate
features nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expression
dark hairs were already showing on his upper lip and his whole face
expressed impetuosity and enthusiasm nicholas blushed when he entered
the drawing room he evidently tried to find something to say but
failed borís on the contrary at once found his footing and related
quietly and humorously how he had known that doll mimi when she was
still quite a young lady before her nose was broken how she had aged
during the five years he had known her and how her head had cracked
right across the skull having said this he glanced at natásha she
turned away from him and glanced at her younger brother who was
screwing up his eyes and shaking with suppressed laughter and unable to
control herself any longer she jumped up and rushed from the room as
fast as her nimble little feet would carry her borís did not laugh

you were meaning to go out werent you mamma do you want the
carriage he asked his mother with a smile

yes yes go and tell them to get it ready she answered returning
his smile

borís quietly left the room and went in search of natásha the plump boy
ran after them angrily as if vexed that their program had been
disturbed





chapter xii

the only young people remaining in the drawing room not counting the
young lady visitor and the countess eldest daughter who was four years
older than her sister and behaved already like a grownup person were
nicholas and sónya the niece sónya was a slender little brunette with
a tender look in her eyes which were veiled by long lashes thick black
plaits coiling twice round her head and a tawny tint in her complexion
and especially in the color of her slender but graceful and muscular
arms and neck by the grace of her movements by the softness and
flexibility of her small limbs and by a certain coyness and reserve of
manner she reminded one of a pretty halfgrown kitten which promises
to become a beautiful little cat she evidently considered it proper to
show an interest in the general conversation by smiling but in spite of
herself her eyes under their thick long lashes watched her cousin who
was going to join the army with such passionate girlish adoration that
her smile could not for a single instant impose upon anyone and it was
clear that the kitten had settled down only to spring up with more
energy and again play with her cousin as soon as they too could like
natásha and borís escape from the drawing room

ah yes my dear said the count addressing the visitor and pointing
to nicholas his friend borís has become an officer and so for
friendships sake he is leaving the university and me his old father
and entering the military service my dear and there was a place and
everything waiting for him in the archives department isnt that
friendship remarked the count in an inquiring tone

but they say that war has been declared replied the visitor

theyve been saying so a long while said the count and theyll say
so again and again and that will be the end of it my dear theres
friendship for you he repeated hes joining the hussars

the visitor not knowing what to say shook her head

its not at all from friendship declared nicholas flaring up and
turning away as if from a shameful aspersion it is not from friendship
at all i simply feel that the army is my vocation

he glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor and they were both
regarding him with a smile of approbation

schubert the colonel of the pávlograd hussars is dining with us
today he has been here on leave and is taking nicholas back with him
it cant be helped said the count shrugging his shoulders and
speaking playfully of a matter that evidently distressed him

i have already told you papa said his son that if you dont wish
to let me go ill stay but i know i am no use anywhere except in the
army i am not a diplomat or a government clerki dont know how to
hide what i feel as he spoke he kept glancing with the flirtatiousness
of a handsome youth at sónya and the young lady visitor

the little kitten feasting her eyes on him seemed ready at any moment
to start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature

all right all right said the old count he always flares up this
buonaparte has turned all their heads they all think of how he rose
from an ensign and became emperor well well god grant it he added
not noticing his visitors sarcastic smile

the elders began talking about bonaparte julie karágina turned to young
rostóv

what a pity you werent at the arkhárovs on thursday it was so dull
without you said she giving him a tender smile

the young man flattered sat down nearer to her with a coquettish
smile and engaged the smiling julie in a confidential conversation
without at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the heart
of sónya who blushed and smiled unnaturally in the midst of his talk
he glanced round at her she gave him a passionately angry glance and
hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the artificial smile on
her lips she got up and left the room all nicholas animation
vanished he waited for the first pause in the conversation and then
with a distressed face left the room to find sónya

how plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their sleeves
said anna mikháylovna pointing to nicholas as he went out
cousinagedangereux voisinage  she added

 cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood

yes said the countess when the brightness these young people had
brought into the room had vanished and as if answering a question no
one had put but which was always in her mind and how much suffering
how much anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice in them
now and yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy one is
always always anxious especially just at this age so dangerous both
for girls and boys

it all depends on the bringing up remarked the visitor

yes youre quite right continued the countess till now i have
always thank god been my childrens friend and had their full
confidence said she repeating the mistake of so many parents who
imagine that their children have no secrets from them i know i shall
always be my daughters first confidante and that if nicholas with his
impulsive nature does get into mischief a boy cant help it he will
all the same never be like those petersburg young men

yes they are splendid splendid youngsters chimed in the count who
always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by deciding that
everything was splendid just fancy wants to be an hussar whats one
to do my dear

what a charming creature your younger girl is said the visitor a
little volcano

yes a regular volcano said the count takes after me and what a
voice she has though shes my daughter i tell the truth when i say
shell be a singer a second salomoni we have engaged an italian to
give her lessons

isnt she too young i have heard that it harms the voice to train it
at that age

oh no not at all too young replied the count why our mothers used
to be married at twelve or thirteen

and shes in love with borís already just fancy said the countess
with a gentle smile looking at borís and went on evidently concerned
with a thought that always occupied her now you see if i were to be
severe with her and to forbid it  goodness knows what they might be
up to on the sly she meant that they would be kissing but as it is
i know every word she utters she will come running to me of her own
accord in the evening and tell me everything perhaps i spoil her but
really that seems the best plan with her elder sister i was stricter

yes i was brought up quite differently remarked the handsome elder
daughter countess véra with a smile

but the smile did not enhance véras beauty as smiles generally do on
the contrary it gave her an unnatural and therefore unpleasant
expression véra was goodlooking not at all stupid quick at learning
was wellbrought up and had a pleasant voice what she said was true
and appropriate yet strange to say everyonethe visitors and countess
aliketurned to look at her as if wondering why she had said it and
they all felt awkward

people are always too clever with their eldest children and try to make
something exceptional of them said the visitor

whats the good of denying it my dear our dear countess was too
clever with véra said the count well what of that shes turned out
splendidly all the same he added winking at véra

the guests got up and took their leave promising to return to dinner

what manners i thought they would never go said the countess when
she had seen her guests out





chapter xiii

when natásha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as the
conservatory there she paused and stood listening to the conversation
in the drawing room waiting for borís to come out she was already
growing impatient and stamped her foot ready to cry at his not coming
at once when she heard the young mans discreet steps approaching
neither quickly nor slowly at this natásha dashed swiftly among the
flower tubs and hid there

borís paused in the middle of the room looked round brushed a little
dust from the sleeve of his uniform and going up to a mirror examined
his handsome face natásha very still peered out from her ambush
waiting to see what he would do he stood a little while before the
glass smiled and walked toward the other door natásha was about to
call him but changed her mind let him look for me thought she
hardly had borís gone than sónya flushed in tears and muttering
angrily came in at the other door natásha checked her first impulse to
run out to her and remained in her hiding place watchingas under an
invisible capto see what went on in the world she was experiencing a
new and peculiar pleasure sónya muttering to herself kept looking
round toward the drawing room door it opened and nicholas came in

sónya what is the matter with you how can you said he running up
to her

its nothing nothing leave me alone sobbed sónya

ah i know what it is

well if you do so much the better and you can go back to her

sóoonya look here how can you torture me and yourself like that
for a mere fancy said nicholas taking her hand

sónya did not pull it away and left off crying natásha not stirring
and scarcely breathing watched from her ambush with sparkling eyes
what will happen now thought she

sónya what is anyone in the world to me you alone are everything
said nicholas and i will prove it to you

i dont like you to talk like that

well then i wont only forgive me sónya he drew her to him and
kissed her

oh how nice thought natásha and when sónya and nicholas had gone
out of the conservatory she followed and called borís to her

borís come here said she with a sly and significant look i have
something to tell you here here and she led him into the
conservatory to the place among the tubs where she had been hiding

borís followed her smiling

what is the something asked he

she grew confused glanced round and seeing the doll she had thrown
down on one of the tubs picked it up

kiss the doll said she

borís looked attentively and kindly at her eager face but did not
reply

dont you want to well then come here said she and went further
in among the plants and threw down the doll closer closer she
whispered

she caught the young officer by his cuffs and a look of solemnity and
fear appeared on her flushed face

and me would you like to kiss me she whispered almost inaudibly
glancing up at him from under her brows smiling and almost crying from
excitement

borís blushed

how funny you are he said bending down to her and blushing still
more but he waited and did nothing

suddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he embraced him so
that both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck and tossing
back her hair kissed him full on the lips

then she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of the tubs
and stood hanging her head

natásha he said you know that i love you but

you are in love with me natásha broke in

yes i am but please dont let us do like that in another four
years  then i will ask for your hand

natásha considered

thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen she counted on her slender
little fingers all right then its settled

a smile of joy and satisfaction lit up her eager face

settled replied borís

forever said the little girl till death itself

she took his arm and with a happy face went with him into the adjoining
sitting room





chapter xiv

after receiving her visitors the countess was so tired that she gave
orders to admit no more but the porter was told to be sure to invite to
dinner all who came to congratulate the countess wished to have a
têteàtête talk with the friend of her childhood princess anna
mikháylovna whom she had not seen properly since she returned from
petersburg anna mikháylovna with her tearworn but pleasant face drew
her chair nearer to that of the countess

with you i will be quite frank said anna mikháylovna there are not
many left of us old friends thats why i so value your friendship

anna mikháylovna looked at véra and paused the countess pressed her
friends hand

véra she said to her eldest daughter who was evidently not a
favorite how is it you have so little tact dont you see you are not
wanted here go to the other girls or

the handsome véra smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all hurt

if you had told me sooner mamma i would have gone she replied as
she rose to go to her own room

but as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples sitting one
pair at each window she stopped and smiled scornfully sónya was
sitting close to nicholas who was copying out some verses for her the
first he had ever written borís and natásha were at the other window
and ceased talking when véra entered sónya and natásha looked at véra
with guilty happy faces

it was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love but
apparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling in véra

how often have i asked you not to take my things she said you have
a room of your own and she took the inkstand from nicholas

in a minute in a minute he said dipping his pen

you always manage to do things at the wrong time continued véra you
came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt ashamed of
you

though what she said was quite just perhaps for that very reason no one
replied and the four simply looked at one another she lingered in the
room with the inkstand in her hand

and at your age what secrets can there be between natásha and borís or
between you two its all nonsense

now véra what does it matter to you said natásha in defense
speaking very gently

she seemed that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate to
everyone

very silly said véra i am ashamed of you secrets indeed

all have secrets of their own answered natásha getting warmer we
dont interfere with you and berg

i should think not said véra because there can never be anything
wrong in my behavior but ill just tell mamma how you are behaving with
borís

natálya ilyníchna behaves very well to me remarked borís i have
nothing to complain of

dont borís you are such a diplomat that it is really tiresome said
natásha in a mortified voice that trembled slightly she used the word
diplomat which was just then much in vogue among the children in the
special sense they attached to it why does she bother me and she
added turning to véra youll never understand it because youve
never loved anyone you have no heart you are a madame de genlis and
nothing more this nickname bestowed on véra by nicholas was
considered very stinging and your greatest pleasure is to be
unpleasant to people go and flirt with berg as much as you please she
finished quickly

i shall at any rate not run after a young man before visitors

well now youve done what you wanted put in nicholassaid
unpleasant things to everyone and upset them lets go to the nursery

all four like a flock of scared birds got up and left the room

the unpleasant things were said to me remarked véra i said none to
anyone

madame de genlis madame de genlis shouted laughing voices through
the door

the handsome véra who produced such an irritating and unpleasant effect
on everyone smiled and evidently unmoved by what had been said to her
went to the looking glass and arranged her hair and scarf looking at
her own handsome face she seemed to become still colder and calmer

in the drawing room the conversation was still going on

ah my dear said the countess my life is not all roses either
dont i know that at the rate we are living our means wont last long
its all the club and his easygoing nature even in the country do we
get any rest theatricals hunting and heaven knows what besides but
dont lets talk about me tell me how you managed everything i often
wonder at you annettehow at your age you can rush off alone in a
carriage to moscow to petersburg to those ministers and great people
and know how to deal with them all its quite astonishing how did you
get things settled i couldnt possibly do it

ah my love answered anna mikháylovna god grant you never know what
it is to be left a widow without means and with a son you love to
distraction one learns many things then she added with a certain
pride that lawsuit taught me much when i want to see one of those big
people i write a note princess soandso desires an interview with so
andso and then i take a cab and go myself two three or four
timestill i get what i want i dont mind what they think of me

well and to whom did you apply about bóry asked the countess you
see yours is already an officer in the guards while my nicholas is
going as a cadet theres no one to interest himself for him to whom
did you apply

to prince vasíli he was so kind he at once agreed to everything and
put the matter before the emperor said princess anna mikháylovna
enthusiastically quite forgetting all the humiliation she had endured
to gain her end

has prince vasíli aged much asked the countess i have not seen him
since we acted together at the rumyántsovs theatricals i expect he has
forgotten me he paid me attentions in those days said the countess
with a smile

he is just the same as ever replied anna mikháylovna overflowing
with amiability his position has not turned his head at all he said to
me i am sorry i can do so little for you dear princess i am at your
command yes he is a fine fellow and a very kind relation but
nataly you know my love for my son i would do anything for his
happiness and my affairs are in such a bad way that my position is now
a terrible one continued anna mikháylovna sadly dropping her voice
my wretched lawsuit takes all i have and makes no progress would you
believe it i have literally not a penny and dont know how to equip
borís she took out her handkerchief and began to cry i need five
hundred rubles and have only one twentyfiveruble note i am in such a
state my only hope now is in count cyril vladímirovich bezúkhov if
he will not assist his godsonyou know he is bórys godfatherand allow
him something for his maintenance all my trouble will have been thrown
away i shall not be able to equip him

the countess eyes filled with tears and she pondered in silence

i often think though perhaps its a sin said the princess that
here lives count cyril vladímirovich bezúkhov so rich all alone that
tremendous fortune and what is his life worth its a burden to him
and bórys life is only just beginning

surely he will leave something to borís said the countess

heaven only knows my dear these rich grandees are so selfish still
i will take borís and go to see him at once and i shall speak to him
straight out let people think what they will of me its really all the
same to me when my sons fate is at stake the princess rose its now
two oclock and you dine at four there will just be time

and like a practical petersburg lady who knows how to make the most of
time anna mikháylovna sent someone to call her son and went into the
anteroom with him

goodbye my dear said she to the countess who saw her to the door
and added in a whisper so that her son should not hear wish me good
luck

are you going to count cyril vladímirovich my dear said the count
coming out from the dining hall into the anteroom and he added if he
is better ask pierre to dine with us he has been to the house you
know and danced with the children be sure to invite him my dear we
will see how tarás distinguishes himself today he says count orlóv
never gave such a dinner as ours will be





chapter xv

my dear borís said princess anna mikháylovna to her son as countess
rostóvas carriage in which they were seated drove over the straw
covered street and turned into the wide courtyard of count cyril
vladímirovich bezúkhovs house my dear borís said the mother
drawing her hand from beneath her old mantle and laying it timidly and
tenderly on her sons arm be affectionate and attentive to him count
cyril vladímirovich is your godfather after all your future depends on
him remember that my dear and be nice to him as you so well know how
to be

if only i knew that anything besides humiliation would come of it
answered her son coldly but i have promised and will do it for your
sake

although the hall porter saw someones carriage standing at the
entrance after scrutinizing the mother and son who without asking to
be announced had passed straight through the glass porch between the
rows of statues in niches and looking significantly at the ladys old
cloak he asked whether they wanted the count or the princesses and
hearing that they wished to see the count said his excellency was worse
today and that his excellency was not receiving anyone

we may as well go back said the son in french

my dear exclaimed his mother imploringly again laying her hand on
his arm as if that touch might soothe or rouse him

borís said no more but looked inquiringly at his mother without taking
off his cloak

my friend said anna mikháylovna in gentle tones addressing the hall
porter i know count cyril vladímirovich is very ill thats why i
have come i am a relation i shall not disturb him my friend i
only need see prince vasíli sergéevich he is staying here is he not
please announce me

the hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs and turned
away

princess drubetskáya to see prince vasíli sergéevich he called to a
footman dressed in knee breeches shoes and a swallowtail coat who
ran downstairs and looked over from the halfway landing

the mother smoothed the folds of her dyed silk dress before a large
venetian mirror in the wall and in her troddendown shoes briskly
ascended the carpeted stairs

my dear she said to her son once more stimulating him by a touch
you promised me

the son lowering his eyes followed her quietly

they entered the large hall from which one of the doors led to the
apartments assigned to prince vasíli

just as the mother and son having reached the middle of the hall were
about to ask their way of an elderly footman who had sprung up as they
entered the bronze handle of one of the doors turned and prince vasíli
came outwearing a velvet coat with a single star on his breast as was
his custom when at hometaking leave of a goodlooking darkhaired man
this was the celebrated petersburg doctor lorrain

then it is certain said the prince

prince humanum est errare  but replied the doctor swallowing
his rs and pronouncing the latin words with a french accent

 to err is human

very well very well

seeing anna mikháylovna and her son prince vasíli dismissed the doctor
with a bow and approached them silently and with a look of inquiry the
son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow suddenly clouded his
mothers face and he smiled slightly

ah prince in what sad circumstances we meet again and how is our
dear invalid said she as though unaware of the cold offensive look
fixed on her

prince vasíli stared at her and at borís questioningly and perplexed
borís bowed politely prince vasíli without acknowledging the bow turned
to anna mikháylovna answering her query by a movement of the head and
lips indicating very little hope for the patient

is it possible exclaimed anna mikháylovna oh how awful it is
terrible to think this is my son she added indicating borís he
wanted to thank you himself

borís bowed again politely

believe me prince a mothers heart will never forget what you have
done for us

i am glad i was able to do you a service my dear anna mikháylovna
said prince vasíli arranging his lace frill and in tone and manner
here in moscow to anna mikháylovna whom he had placed under an
obligation assuming an air of much greater importance than he had done
in petersburg at anna schérers reception

try to serve well and show yourself worthy added he addressing borís
with severity i am glad are you here on leave he went on in his
usual tone of indifference

i am awaiting orders to join my new regiment your excellency replied
borís betraying neither annoyance at the princes brusque manner nor a
desire to enter into conversation but speaking so quietly and
respectfully that the prince gave him a searching glance

are you living with your mother

i am living at countess rostóvas replied borís again adding your
excellency

that is with ilyá rostóv who married nataly shinshíná said anna
mikháylovna

i know i know answered prince vasíli in his monotonous voice i
never could understand how nataly made up her mind to marry that
unlicked bear a perfectly absurd and stupid fellow and a gambler too
i am told

but a very kind man prince said anna mikháylovna with a pathetic
smile as though she too knew that count rostóv deserved this censure
but asked him not to be too hard on the poor old man what do the
doctors say asked the princess after a pause her worn face again
expressing deep sorrow

they give little hope replied the prince

and i should so like to thank uncle once for all his kindness to me and
borís he is his godson she added her tone suggesting that this fact
ought to give prince vasíli much satisfaction

prince vasíli became thoughtful and frowned anna mikháylovna saw that
he was afraid of finding in her a rival for count bezúkhovs fortune
and hastened to reassure him

if it were not for my sincere affection and devotion to uncle said
she uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern i know
his character noble upright  but you see he has no one with him
except the young princesses they are still young she bent her
head and continued in a whisper has he performed his final duty
prince how priceless are those last moments it can make things no
worse and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if he is so ill we
women prince and she smiled tenderly always know how to say these
things i absolutely must see him however painful it may be for me i
am used to suffering

evidently the prince understood her and also understood as he had done
at anna pávlovnas that it would be difficult to get rid of anna
mikháylovna

would not such a meeting be too trying for him dear anna mikháylovna
said he let us wait until evening the doctors are expecting a
crisis

but one cannot delay prince at such a moment consider that the
welfare of his soul is at stake ah it is awful the duties of a
christian

a door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses the
counts niece entered with a cold stern face the length of her body
was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs prince vasíli turned
to her

well how is he

still the same but what can you expect this noise said the
princess looking at anna mikháylovna as at a stranger

ah my dear i hardly knew you said anna mikháylovna with a happy
smile ambling lightly up to the counts niece i have come and am at
your service to help you nurse my uncle i imagine what you have gone
through and she sympathetically turned up her eyes

the princess gave no reply and did not even smile but left the room as
anna mikháylovna took off her gloves and occupying the position she had
conquered settled down in an armchair inviting prince vasíli to take a
seat beside her

borís she said to her son with a smile i shall go in to see the
count my uncle but you my dear had better go to pierre meanwhile and
dont forget to give him the rostóvs invitation they ask him to
dinner i suppose he wont go she continued turning to the prince

on the contrary replied the prince who had plainly become depressed
i shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young man here
he is and the count has not once asked for him

he shrugged his shoulders a footman conducted borís down one flight of
stairs and up another to pierres rooms





chapter xvi

pierre after all had not managed to choose a career for himself in
petersburg and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and
sent to moscow the story told about him at count rostóvs was true
pierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear he had now been
for some days in moscow and was staying as usual at his fathers house
though he expected that the story of his escapade would be already known
in moscow and that the ladies about his fatherwho were never favorably
disposed toward himwould have used it to turn the count against him he
nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to his fathers part of the
house entering the drawing room where the princesses spent most of
their time he greeted the ladies two of whom were sitting at
embroidery frames while a third read aloud it was the eldest who was
readingthe one who had met anna mikháylovna the two younger ones were
embroidering both were rosy and pretty and they differed only in that
one had a little mole on her lip which made her much prettier pierre
was received as if he were a corpse or a leper the eldest princess
paused in her reading and silently stared at him with frightened eyes
the second assumed precisely the same expression while the youngest
the one with the mole who was of a cheerful and lively disposition
bent over her frame to hide a smile probably evoked by the amusing scene
she foresaw she drew her wool down through the canvas and scarcely
able to refrain from laughing stooped as if trying to make out the
pattern

how do you do cousin said pierre you dont recognize me

i recognize you only too well too well

how is the count can i see him asked pierre awkwardly as usual but
unabashed

the count is suffering physically and mentally and apparently you have
done your best to increase his mental sufferings

can i see the count pierre again asked

hm if you wish to kill him to kill him outright you can see
him olga go and see whether uncles beef tea is readyit is almost
time she added giving pierre to understand that they were busy and
busy making his father comfortable while evidently he pierre was only
busy causing him annoyance

olga went out pierre stood looking at the sisters then he bowed and
said then i will go to my rooms you will let me know when i can see
him

and he left the room followed by the low but ringing laughter of the
sister with the mole

next day prince vasíli had arrived and settled in the counts house he
sent for pierre and said to him my dear fellow if you are going to
behave here as you did in petersburg you will end very badly that is
all i have to say to you the count is very very ill and you must not
see him at all

since then pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole time in
his rooms upstairs

when borís appeared at his door pierre was pacing up and down his room
stopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at the wall
as if running a sword through an invisible foe and glaring savagely
over his spectacles and then again resuming his walk muttering
indistinct words shrugging his shoulders and gesticulating

england is done for said he scowling and pointing his finger at
someone unseen mr pitt as a traitor to the nation and to the rights
of man is sentenced to but before pierrewho at that moment
imagined himself to be napoleon in person and to have just effected the
dangerous crossing of the straits of dover and captured londoncould
pronounce pitts sentence he saw a wellbuilt and handsome young
officer entering his room pierre paused he had left moscow when borís
was a boy of fourteen and had quite forgotten him but in his usual
impulsive and hearty way he took borís by the hand with a friendly
smile

do you remember me asked borís quietly with a pleasant smile i have
come with my mother to see the count but it seems he is not well

yes it seems he is ill people are always disturbing him answered
pierre trying to remember who this young man was

borís felt that pierre did not recognize him but did not consider it
necessary to introduce himself and without experiencing the least
embarrassment looked pierre straight in the face

count rostóv asks you to come to dinner today said he after a
considerable pause which made pierre feel uncomfortable

ah count rostóv exclaimed pierre joyfully then you are his son
ilyá only fancy i didnt know you at first do you remember how we
went to the sparrow hills with madame jacquot its such an age

you are mistaken said borís deliberately with a bold and slightly
sarcastic smile i am borís son of princess anna mikháylovna
drubetskáya rostóv the father is ilyá and his son is nicholas i
never knew any madame jacquot

pierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or bees

oh dear what am i thinking about ive mixed everything up one has so
many relatives in moscow so you are borís of course well now we know
where we are and what do you think of the boulogne expedition the
english will come off badly you know if napoleon gets across the
channel i think the expedition is quite feasible if only villeneuve
doesnt make a mess of things

borís knew nothing about the boulogne expedition he did not read the
papers and it was the first time he had heard villeneuves name

we here in moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal
than with politics said he in his quiet ironical tone i know nothing
about it and have not thought about it moscow is chiefly busy with
gossip he continued just now they are talking about you and your
father

pierre smiled in his goodnatured way as if afraid for his companions
sake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret but
borís spoke distinctly clearly and dryly looking straight into
pierres eyes

moscow has nothing else to do but gossip borís went on everybody is
wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune though he may
perhaps outlive us all as i sincerely hope he will

yes it is all very horrid interrupted pierre very horrid

pierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say
something disconcerting to himself

and it must seem to you said borís flushing slightly but not
changing his tone or attitude it must seem to you that everyone is
trying to get something out of the rich man

so it does thought pierre

but i just wish to say to avoid misunderstandings that you are quite
mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people we are very
poor but for my own part at any rate for the very reason that your
father is rich i dont regard myself as a relation of his and neither
i nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from him

for a long time pierre could not understand but when he did he jumped
up from the sofa seized borís under the elbow in his quick clumsy way
and blushing far more than borís began to speak with a feeling of
mingled shame and vexation

well this is strange do you suppose i who could think i know
very well

but borís again interrupted him

i am glad i have spoken out fully perhaps you did not like it you
must excuse me said he putting pierre at ease instead of being put at
ease by him but i hope i have not offended you i always make it a
rule to speak out well what answer am i to take will you come to
dinner at the rostóvs

and borís having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty and
extricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in it
became quite pleasant again

no but i say said pierre calming down you are a wonderful fellow
what you have just said is good very good of course you dont know me
we have not met for such a long time not since we were children you
might think that i i understand quite understand i could not have
done it myself i should not have had the courage but its splendid i
am very glad to have made your acquaintance its queer he added after
a pause that you should have suspected me he began to laugh well
what of it i hope well get better acquainted and he pressed borís
hand do you know i have not once been in to see the count he has not
sent for me i am sorry for him as a man but what can one do

and so you think napoleon will manage to get an army across asked
borís with a smile

pierre saw that borís wished to change the subject and being of the
same mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the
boulogne expedition

a footman came in to summon borísthe princess was going pierre in
order to make borís better acquaintance promised to come to dinner
and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his spectacles
into borís eyes after he had gone pierre continued pacing up and down
the room for a long time no longer piercing an imaginary foe with his
imaginary sword but smiling at the remembrance of that pleasant
intelligent and resolute young man

as often happens in early youth especially to one who leads a lonely
life he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man and made up
his mind that they would be friends

prince vasíli saw the princess off she held a handkerchief to her eyes
and her face was tearful

it is dreadful dreadful she was saying but cost me what it may i
shall do my duty i will come and spend the night he must not be left
like this every moment is precious i cant think why his nieces put it
off perhaps god will help me to find a way to prepare him adieu
prince may god support you

adieu ma bonne answered prince vasíli turning away from her

oh he is in a dreadful state said the mother to her son when they
were in the carriage he hardly recognizes anybody

i dont understand mammawhat is his attitude to pierre asked the
son

the will will show that my dear our fate also depends on it

but why do you expect that he will leave us anything

ah my dear he is so rich and we are so poor

well that is hardly a sufficient reason mamma

oh heaven how ill he is exclaimed the mother





chapter xvii

after anna mikháylovna had driven off with her son to visit count cyril
vladímirovich bezúkhov countess rostóva sat for a long time all alone
applying her handkerchief to her eyes at last she rang

what is the matter with you my dear she said crossly to the maid who
kept her waiting some minutes dont you wish to serve me then ill
find you another place

the countess was upset by her friends sorrow and humiliating poverty
and was therefore out of sorts a state of mind which with her always
found expression in calling her maid my dear and speaking to her with
exaggerated politeness

i am very sorry maam answered the maid

ask the count to come to me

the count came waddling in to see his wife with a rather guilty look as
usual

well little countess what a sauté of game au madère we are to have
my dear i tasted it the thousand rubles i paid for tarás were not ill
spent he is worth it

he sat down by his wife his elbows on his knees and his hands ruffling
his gray hair

what are your commands little countess

you see my dear whats that mess she said pointing to his
waistcoat its the sauté most likely she added with a smile well
you see count i want some money

her face became sad

oh little countess  and the count began bustling to get out his
pocketbook

i want a great deal count i want five hundred rubles and taking out
her cambric handkerchief she began wiping her husbands waistcoat

yes immediately immediately hey whos there he called out in a
tone only used by persons who are certain that those they call will rush
to obey the summons send dmítri to me

dmítri a man of good family who had been brought up in the counts
house and now managed all his affairs stepped softly into the room

this is what i want my dear fellow said the count to the deferential
young man who had entered bring me he reflected a moment yes
bring me seven hundred rubles yes but mind dont bring me such
tattered and dirty notes as last time but nice clean ones for the
countess

yes dmítri clean ones please said the countess sighing deeply

when would you like them your excellency asked dmítri allow me to
inform you but dont be uneasy he added noticing that the count
was beginning to breathe heavily and quickly which was always a sign of
approaching anger i was forgetting do you wish it brought at once

yes yes just so bring it give it to the countess

what a treasure that dmítri is added the count with a smile when the
young man had departed there is never any impossible with him
thats a thing i hate everything is possible

ah money count money how much sorrow it causes in the world said
the countess but i am in great need of this sum

you my little countess are a notorious spendthrift said the count
and having kissed his wifes hand he went back to his study

when anna mikháylovna returned from count bezúkhovs the money all in
clean notes was lying ready under a handkerchief on the countess
little table and anna mikháylovna noticed that something was agitating
her

well my dear asked the countess

oh what a terrible state he is in one would not know him he is so
ill i was only there a few moments and hardly said a word

annette for heavens sake dont refuse me the countess began with a
blush that looked very strange on her thin dignified elderly face and
she took the money from under the handkerchief

anna mikháylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped to be ready
to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment

this is for borís from me for his outfit

anna mikháylovna was already embracing her and weeping the countess
wept too they wept because they were friends and because they were
kindhearted and because theyfriends from childhoodhad to think about
such a base thing as money and because their youth was over but
those tears were pleasant to them both





chapter xviii

countess rostóva with her daughters and a large number of guests was
already seated in the drawing room the count took the gentlemen into
his study and showed them his choice collection of turkish pipes from
time to time he went out to ask hasnt she come yet they were
expecting márya dmítrievna akhrosímova known in society as le terrible
dragon a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank but for common
sense and frank plainness of speech márya dmítrievna was known to the
imperial family as well as to all moscow and petersburg and both cities
wondered at her laughed privately at her rudenesses and told good
stories about her while none the less all without exception respected
and feared her

in the counts room which was full of tobacco smoke they talked of war
that had been announced in a manifesto and about the recruiting none
of them had yet seen the manifesto but they all knew it had appeared
the count sat on the sofa between two guests who were smoking and
talking he neither smoked nor talked but bending his head first to one
side and then to the other watched the smokers with evident pleasure and
listened to the conversation of his two neighbors whom he egged on
against each other

one of them was a sallow cleanshaven civilian with a thin and wrinkled
face already growing old though he was dressed like a most fashionable
young man he sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home and
having stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth was inhaling the
smoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes this was an old bachelor
shinshín a cousin of the countess a man with a sharp tongue as they
said in moscow society he seemed to be condescending to his companion
the latter a fresh rosy officer of the guards irreproachably washed
brushed and buttoned held his pipe in the middle of his mouth and with
red lips gently inhaled the smoke letting it escape from his handsome
mouth in rings this was lieutenant berg an officer in the semënov
regiment with whom borís was to travel to join the army and about whom
natásha had teased her elder sister véra speaking of berg as her
intended the count sat between them and listened attentively his
favorite occupation when not playing boston a card game he was very
fond of was that of listener especially when he succeeded in setting
two loquacious talkers at one another

well then old chap mon très honorable alphonse kárlovich said
shinshín laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary russian
expressions with the choicest french phraseswhich was a peculiarity of
his speech vous comptez vous faire des rentes sur létat  you want
to make something out of your company

 you expect to make an income out of the government

no peter nikoláevich i only want to show that in the cavalry the
advantages are far less than in the infantry just consider my own
position now peter nikoláevich

berg always spoke quietly politely and with great precision his
conversation always related entirely to himself he would remain calm
and silent when the talk related to any topic that had no direct bearing
on himself he could remain silent for hours without being at all put
out of countenance himself or making others uncomfortable but as soon
as the conversation concerned himself he would begin to talk
circumstantially and with evident satisfaction

consider my position peter nikoláevich were i in the cavalry i should
get not more than two hundred rubles every four months even with the
rank of lieutenant but as it is i receive two hundred and thirty said
he looking at shinshín and the count with a joyful pleasant smile as
if it were obvious to him that his success must always be the chief
desire of everyone else

besides that peter nikoláevich by exchanging into the guards i shall
be in a more prominent position continued berg and vacancies occur
much more frequently in the foot guards then just think what can be
done with two hundred and thirty rubles i even manage to put a little
aside and to send something to my father he went on emitting a smoke
ring

la balance y est  a german knows how to skin a flint as the
proverb says remarked shinshín moving his pipe to the other side of
his mouth and winking at the count

 so that squares matters

the count burst out laughing the other guests seeing that shinshín was
talking came up to listen berg oblivious of irony or indifference
continued to explain how by exchanging into the guards he had already
gained a step on his old comrades of the cadet corps how in wartime the
company commander might get killed and he as senior in the company
might easily succeed to the post how popular he was with everyone in
the regiment and how satisfied his father was with him berg evidently
enjoyed narrating all this and did not seem to suspect that others
too might have their own interests but all he said was so prettily
sedate and the naïveté of his youthful egotism was so obvious that he
disarmed his hearers

well my boy youll get along wherever you gofoot or horsethat ill
warrant said shinshín patting him on the shoulder and taking his feet
off the sofa

berg smiled joyously the count by his guests went into the drawing
room

it was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled guests
expecting the summons to zakúska  avoid engaging in any long
conversation but think it necessary to move about and talk in order to
show that they are not at all impatient for their food the host and
hostess look toward the door and now and then glance at one another
and the visitors try to guess from these glances who or what they are
waiting forsome important relation who has not yet arrived or a dish
that is not yet ready

 hors doeuvres

pierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly in the
middle of the drawing room on the first chair he had come across
blocking the way for everyone the countess tried to make him talk but
he went on naïvely looking around through his spectacles as if in search
of somebody and answered all her questions in monosyllables he was in
the way and was the only one who did not notice the fact most of the
guests knowing of the affair with the bear looked with curiosity at
this big stout quiet man wondering how such a clumsy modest fellow
could have played such a prank on a policeman

you have only lately arrived the countess asked him

oui madame replied he looking around him

you have not yet seen my husband

non madame he smiled quite inappropriately

you have been in paris recently i believe i suppose its very
interesting

very interesting

the countess exchanged glances with anna mikháylovna the latter
understood that she was being asked to entertain this young man and
sitting down beside him she began to speak about his father but he
answered her as he had the countess only in monosyllables the other
guests were all conversing with one another the razumóvskis it was
charming you are very kind countess apráksina was heard on all
sides the countess rose and went into the ballroom

márya dmítrievna came her voice from there

herself came the answer in a rough voice and márya dmítrievna
entered the room

all the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the very
oldest rose márya dmítrievna paused at the door tall and stout
holding high her fiftyyearold head with its gray curls she stood
surveying the guests and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if
rolling them up márya dmítrievna always spoke in russian

health and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to her
children she said in her loud fulltoned voice which drowned all
others well you old sinner she went on turning to the count who
was kissing her hand youre feeling dull in moscow i daresay nowhere
to hunt with your dogs but what is to be done old man just see how
these nestlings are growing up and she pointed to the girls you must
look for husbands for them whether you like it or not

well said she hows my cossack márya dmítrievna always called
natásha a cossack and she stroked the childs arm as she came up
fearless and gay to kiss her hand i know shes a scamp of a girl but
i like her

she took a pair of pearshaped ruby earrings from her huge reticule and
having given them to the rosy natásha who beamed with the pleasure of
her saintsday fete turned away at once and addressed herself to
pierre

eh eh friend come here a bit said she assuming a soft high tone
of voice come here my friend and she ominously tucked up her
sleeves still higher pierre approached looking at her in a childlike
way through his spectacles

come nearer come nearer friend i used to be the only one to tell
your father the truth when he was in favor and in your case its my
evident duty she paused all were silent expectant of what was to
follow for this was clearly only a prelude

a fine lad my word a fine lad his father lies on his deathbed and
he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear for shame sir
for shame it would be better if you went to the war

she turned away and gave her hand to the count who could hardly keep
from laughing

well i suppose it is time we were at table said márya dmítrievna

the count went in first with márya dmítrievna the countess followed on
the arm of a colonel of hussars a man of importance to them because
nicholas was to go with him to the regiment then came anna mikháylovna
with shinshín berg gave his arm to véra the smiling julie karágina
went in with nicholas after them other couples followed filling the
whole dining hall and last of all the children tutors and governesses
followed singly the footmen began moving about chairs scraped the
band struck up in the gallery and the guests settled down in their
places then the strains of the counts household band were replaced by
the clatter of knives and forks the voices of visitors and the soft
steps of the footmen at one end of the table sat the countess with
márya dmítrievna on her right and anna mikháylovna on her left the
other lady visitors were farther down at the other end sat the count
with the hussar colonel on his left and shinshín and the other male
visitors on his right midway down the long table on one side sat the
grownup young people véra beside berg and pierre beside borís and on
the other side the children tutors and governesses from behind the
crystal decanters and fruit vases the count kept glancing at his wife
and her tall cap with its lightblue ribbons and busily filled his
neighbors glasses not neglecting his own the countess in turn
without omitting her duties as hostess threw significant glances from
behind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed by
their redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair at the
ladies end an even chatter of voices was heard all the time at the
mens end the voices sounded louder and louder especially that of the
colonel of hussars who growing more and more flushed ate and drank so
much that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests berg
with tender smiles was saying to véra that love is not an earthly but a
heavenly feeling borís was telling his new friend pierre who the guests
were and exchanging glances with natásha who was sitting opposite
pierre spoke little but examined the new faces and ate a great deal of
the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and went on to the
game without omitting a single dish or one of the wines these latter
the butler thrust mysteriously forward wrapped in a napkin from behind
the next mans shoulders and whispered dry madeira hungarian
or rhine wine as the case might be of the four crystal glasses
engraved with the counts monogram that stood before his plate pierre
held out one at random and drank with enjoyment gazing with ever
increasing amiability at the other guests natásha who sat opposite
was looking at borís as girls of thirteen look at the boy they are in
love with and have just kissed for the first time sometimes that same
look fell on pierre and that funny lively little girls look made him
inclined to laugh without knowing why

nicholas sat at some distance from sónya beside julie karágina to whom
he was again talking with the same involuntary smile sónya wore a
company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy now she turned
pale now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what nicholas and
julie were saying to one another the governess kept looking round
uneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might be put upon the
children the german tutor was trying to remember all the dishes wines
and kinds of dessert in order to send a full description of the dinner
to his people in germany and he felt greatly offended when the butler
with a bottle wrapped in a napkin passed him by he frowned trying to
appear as if he did not want any of that wine but was mortified because
no one would understand that it was not to quench his thirst or from
greediness that he wanted it but simply from a conscientious desire for
knowledge





chapter xix

at the mens end of the table the talk grew more and more animated the
colonel told them that the declaration of war had already appeared in
petersburg and that a copy which he had himself seen had that day been
forwarded by courier to the commanderinchief

and why the deuce are we going to fight bonaparte remarked shinshín
he has stopped austrias cackle and i fear it will be our turn next

the colonel was a stout tall plethoric german evidently devoted to
the service and patriotically russian he resented shinshíns remark

it is for the reasson my goot sir said he speaking with a german
accent for the reasson zat ze emperor knows zat he declares in ze
manifessto zat he cannot fiew wiz indifference ze danger vreatening
russia and zat ze safety and dignity of ze empire as vell as ze sanctity
of its alliances he spoke this last word with particular emphasis as
if in it lay the gist of the matter

then with the unerring official memory that characterized him he
repeated from the opening words of the manifesto

 and the wish which constitutes the emperors sole and absolute
aimto establish peace in europe on firm foundationshas now decided him
to despatch part of the army abroad and to create a new condition for
the attainment of that purpose

zat my dear sir is vy he concluded drinking a tumbler of wine
with dignity and looking to the count for approval

connaissezvous le proverbe jerome jerome do not roam but turn
spindles at home said shinshín puckering his brows and smiling
cela nous convient à merveille suvórov nowhe knew what he was
about yet they beat him à plate couture and where are we to find
suvórovs now je vous demande un peu said he continually changing
from french to russian

do you know the proverb

 that suits us down to the ground

 hollow

 i just ask you that

ve must vight to the last trrop of our plood said the colonel
thumping the table and ve must tie for our emperor and zen all vill
pe vell and ve must discuss it as little as pooossible he dwelt
particularly on the word possible as pooossible he ended again
turning to the count zat is how ve old hussars look at it and zeres
an end of it and how do you a young man and a young hussar how do you
judge of it he added addressing nicholas who when he heard that the
war was being discussed had turned from his partner with eyes and ears
intent on the colonel

i am quite of your opinion replied nicholas flaming up turning his
plate round and moving his wineglasses about with as much decision and
desperation as though he were at that moment facing some great danger
i am convinced that we russians must die or conquer he concluded
consciousas were othersafter the words were uttered that his remarks
were too enthusiastic and emphatic for the occasion and were therefore
awkward

what you said just now was splendid said his partner julie

sónya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them and down
to her neck and shoulders while nicholas was speaking

pierre listened to the colonels speech and nodded approvingly

thats fine said he

the young mans a real hussar shouted the colonel again thumping the
table

what are you making such a noise about over there márya dmítrievnas
deep voice suddenly inquired from the other end of the table what are
you thumping the table for she demanded of the hussar and why are
you exciting yourself do you think the french are here

i am speaking ze truce replied the hussar with a smile

its all about the war the count shouted down the table you know my
sons going márya dmítrievna my son is going

i have four sons in the army but still i dont fret it is all in gods
hands you may die in your bed or god may spare you in a battle
replied márya dmítrievnas deep voice which easily carried the whole
length of the table

thats true

once more the conversations concentrated the ladies at the one end and
the mens at the other

you wont ask natáshas little brother was saying i know you wont
ask

i will replied natásha

her face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution she half
rose by a glance inviting pierre who sat opposite to listen to what
was coming and turning to her mother

mamma rang out the clear contralto notes of her childish voice
audible the whole length of the table

what is it asked the countess startled but seeing by her daughters
face that it was only mischief she shook a finger at her sternly with a
threatening and forbidding movement of her head

the conversation was hushed

mamma what sweets are we going to have and natáshas voice sounded
still more firm and resolute

the countess tried to frown but could not márya dmítrievna shook her
fat finger

cossack she said threateningly

most of the guests uncertain how to regard this sally looked at the
elders

you had better take care said the countess

mamma what sweets are we going to have natásha again cried boldly
with saucy gaiety confident that her prank would be taken in good part

sónya and fat little pétya doubled up with laughter

you see i have asked whispered natásha to her little brother and to
pierre glancing at him again

ice pudding but you wont get any said márya dmítrievna

natásha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved even
márya dmítrievna

márya dmítrievna what kind of ice pudding i dont like ice cream

carrot ices

no what kind márya dmítrievna what kind she almost screamed i
want to know

márya dmítrievna and the countess burst out laughing and all the guests
joined in everyone laughed not at márya dmítrievnas answer but at the
incredible boldness and smartness of this little girl who had dared to
treat márya dmítrievna in this fashion

natásha only desisted when she had been told that there would be
pineapple ice before the ices champagne was served round the band
again struck up the count and countess kissed and the guests leaving
their seats went up to congratulate the countess and reached across
the table to clink glasses with the count with the children and with
one another again the footmen rushed about chairs scraped and in the
same order in which they had entered but with redder faces the guests
returned to the drawing room and to the counts study





chapter xx

the card tables were drawn out sets made up for boston and the counts
visitors settled themselves some in the two drawing rooms some in the
sitting room some in the library

the count holding his cards fanwise kept himself with difficulty from
dropping into his usual afterdinner nap and laughed at everything the
young people at the countess instigation gathered round the
clavichord and harp julie by general request played first after she
had played a little air with variations on the harp she joined the
other young ladies in begging natásha and nicholas who were noted for
their musical talent to sing something natásha who was treated as
though she were grown up was evidently very proud of this but at the
same time felt shy

what shall we sing she said

the brook suggested nicholas

well then lets be quick borís come here said natásha but where
is sónya

she looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room ran to
look for her

running into sónyas room and not finding her there natásha ran to the
nursery but sónya was not there either natásha concluded that she must
be on the chest in the passage the chest in the passage was the place
of mourning for the younger female generation in the rostóv household
and there in fact was sónya lying face downward on nurses dirty feather
bed on the top of the chest crumpling her gauzy pink dress under her
hiding her face with her slender fingers and sobbing so convulsively
that her bare little shoulders shook natáshas face which had been so
radiantly happy all that saints day suddenly changed her eyes became
fixed and then a shiver passed down her broad neck and the corners of
her mouth drooped

sónya what is it what is the matter oo oo oo and
natáshas large mouth widened making her look quite ugly and she began
to wail like a baby without knowing why except that sónya was crying
sónya tried to lift her head to answer but could not and hid her face
still deeper in the bed natásha wept sitting on the bluestriped
feather bed and hugging her friend with an effort sónya sat up and
began wiping her eyes and explaining

nicholas is going away in a weeks time his papers have come
he told me himself but still i should not cry and she showed a
paper she held in her handwith the verses nicholas had written still
i should not cry but you cant no one can understand what a soul
he has

and she began to cry again because he had such a noble soul

its all very well for you i am not envious i love you and borís
also she went on gaining a little strength he is nice there are
no difficulties in your way but nicholas is my cousin one would
have to the metropolitan himself and even then it cant be done
and besides if she tells mamma sónya looked upon the countess as her
mother and called her so that i am spoiling nicholas career and am
heartless and ungrateful while truly god is my witness and she
made the sign of the cross i love her so much and all of you only
véra and what for what have i done to her i am so grateful to you
that i would willingly sacrifice everything only i have nothing

sónya could not continue and again hid her face in her hands and in the
feather bed natásha began consoling her but her face showed that she
understood all the gravity of her friends trouble

sónya she suddenly exclaimed as if she had guessed the true reason
of her friends sorrow im sure véra has said something to you since
dinner hasnt she

yes these verses nicholas wrote himself and i copied some others and
she found them on my table and said shed show them to mamma and that i
was ungrateful and that mamma would never allow him to marry me but
that hell marry julie you see how hes been with her all day
natásha what have i done to deserve it

and again she began to sob more bitterly than before natásha lifted
her up hugged her and smiling through her tears began comforting
her

sónya dont believe her darling dont believe her do you remember
how we and nicholas all three of us talked in the sitting room after
supper why we settled how everything was to be i dont quite remember
how but dont you remember that it could all be arranged and how nice
it all was theres uncle shinshíns brother has married his first
cousin and we are only second cousins you know and borís says it is
quite possible you know i have told him all about it and he is so
clever and so good said natásha dont you cry sónya dear love
darling sónya and she kissed her and laughed véras spiteful never
mind her and all will come right and she wont say anything to mamma
nicholas will tell her himself and he doesnt care at all for julie

natásha kissed her on the hair

sónya sat up the little kitten brightened its eyes shone and it
seemed ready to lift its tail jump down on its soft paws and begin
playing with the ball of worsted as a kitten should

do you think so really truly she said quickly smoothing her
frock and hair

really truly answered natásha pushing in a crisp lock that had
strayed from under her friends plaits

both laughed

well lets go and sing the brook

come along

do you know that fat pierre who sat opposite me is so funny said
natásha stopping suddenly i feel so happy

and she set off at a run along the passage

sónya shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the
verses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little chest ran
after natásha down the passage into the sitting room with flushed face
and light joyous steps at the visitors request the young people sang
the quartette the brook with which everyone was delighted then
nicholas sang a song he had just learned

at nighttime in the moons fair glow how sweet as fancies wander free
to feel that in this world theres one who still is thinking but of
thee

that while her fingers touch the harp wafting sweet music oer the lea
it is for thee thus swells her heart sighing its message out to thee

a day or two then bliss unspoilt but oh till then i cannot live

he had not finished the last verse before the young people began to get
ready to dance in the large hall and the sound of the feet and the
coughing of the musicians were heard from the gallery

pierre was sitting in the drawing room where shinshín had engaged him
as a man recently returned from abroad in a political conversation in
which several others joined but which bored pierre when the music began
natásha came in and walking straight up to pierre said laughing and
blushing

mamma told me to ask you to join the dancers

i am afraid of mixing the figures pierre replied but if you will be
my teacher and lowering his big arm he offered it to the slender
little girl

while the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians tuning up
pierre sat down with his little partner natásha was perfectly happy
she was dancing with a grownup man who had been abroad she was
sitting in a conspicuous place and talking to him like a grownup lady
she had a fan in her hand that one of the ladies had given her to hold
assuming quite the pose of a society woman heaven knows when and where
she had learned it she talked with her partner fanning herself and
smiling over the fan

dear dear just look at her exclaimed the countess as she crossed
the ballroom pointing to natásha

natásha blushed and laughed

well really mamma why should you what is there to be surprised at

in the midst of the third écossaise there was a clatter of chairs being
pushed back in the sitting room where the count and márya dmítrievna had
been playing cards with the majority of the more distinguished and older
visitors they now stretching themselves after sitting so long and
replacing their purses and pocketbooks entered the ballroom first came
márya dmítrievna and the count both with merry countenances the count
with playful ceremony somewhat in ballet style offered his bent arm to
márya dmítrievna he drew himself up a smile of debonair gallantry lit
up his face and as soon as the last figure of the écossaise was ended
he clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted up to their gallery
addressing the first violin

semën do you know the daniel cooper

this was the counts favorite dance which he had danced in his youth
strictly speaking daniel cooper was one figure of the anglaise

look at papa shouted natásha to the whole company and quite
forgetting that she was dancing with a grownup partner she bent her
curly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughter

and indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure at the
jovial old gentleman who standing beside his tall and stout partner
márya dmítrievna curved his arms beat time straightened his
shoulders turned out his toes tapped gently with his foot and by a
smile that broadened his round face more and more prepared the
onlookers for what was to follow as soon as the provocatively gay
strains of daniel cooper somewhat resembling those of a merry peasant
dance began to sound all the doorways of the ballroom were suddenly
filled by the domestic serfsthe men on one side and the women on the
otherwho with beaming faces had come to see their master making merry

just look at the master a regular eagle he is loudly remarked the
nurse as she stood in one of the doorways

the count danced well and knew it but his partner could not and did not
want to dance well her enormous figure stood erect her powerful arms
hanging down she had handed her reticule to the countess and only her
stern but handsome face really joined in the dance what was expressed
by the whole of the counts plump figure in márya dmítrievna found
expression only in her more and more beaming face and quivering nose
but if the count getting more and more into the swing of it charmed
the spectators by the unexpectedness of his adroit maneuvers and the
agility with which he capered about on his light feet márya dmítrievna
produced no less impression by slight exertionsthe least effort to move
her shoulders or bend her arms when turning or stamp her footwhich
everyone appreciated in view of her size and habitual severity the
dance grew livelier and livelier the other couples could not attract a
moments attention to their own evolutions and did not even try to do
so all were watching the count and márya dmítrievna natásha kept
pulling everyone by sleeve or dress urging them to look at papa
though as it was they never took their eyes off the couple in the
intervals of the dance the count breathing deeply waved and shouted to
the musicians to play faster faster faster and faster lightly more
lightly and yet more lightly whirled the count flying round márya
dmítrievna now on his toes now on his heels until turning his
partner round to her seat he executed the final pas raising his soft
foot backwards bowing his perspiring head smiling and making a wide
sweep with his arm amid a thunder of applause and laughter led by
natásha both partners stood still breathing heavily and wiping their
faces with their cambric handkerchiefs

thats how we used to dance in our time ma chère said the count

that was a daniel cooper exclaimed márya dmítrievna tucking up her
sleeves and puffing heavily





chapter xxi

while in the rostóvs ballroom the sixth anglaise was being danced to a
tune in which the weary musicians blundered and while tired footmen and
cooks were getting the supper count bezúkhov had a sixth stroke the
doctors pronounced recovery impossible after a mute confession
communion was administered to the dying man preparations made for the
sacrament of unction and in his house there was the bustle and thrill
of suspense usual at such moments outside the house beyond the gates
a group of undertakers who hid whenever a carriage drove up waited in
expectation of an important order for an expensive funeral the military
governor of moscow who had been assiduous in sending aidesdecamp to
inquire after the counts health came himself that evening to bid a
last farewell to the celebrated grandee of catherines court count
bezúkhov

the magnificent reception room was crowded everyone stood up
respectfully when the military governor having stayed about half an
hour alone with the dying man passed out slightly acknowledging their
bows and trying to escape as quickly as possible from the glances fixed
on him by the doctors clergy and relatives of the family prince
vasíli who had grown thinner and paler during the last few days
escorted him to the door repeating something to him several times in
low tones

when the military governor had gone prince vasíli sat down all alone on
a chair in the ballroom crossing one leg high over the other leaning
his elbow on his knee and covering his face with his hand after sitting
so for a while he rose and looking about him with frightened eyes
went with unusually hurried steps down the long corridor leading to the
back of the house to the room of the eldest princess

those who were in the dimly lit reception room spoke in nervous
whispers and whenever anyone went into or came from the dying mans
room grew silent and gazed with eyes full of curiosity or expectancy at
his door which creaked slightly when opened

the limits of human life  are fixed and may not be oerpassed said
an old priest to a lady who had taken a seat beside him and was
listening naïvely to his words

i wonder is it not too late to administer unction asked the lady
adding the priests clerical title as if she had no opinion of her own
on the subject

ah madam it is a great sacrament replied the priest passing his
hand over the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across his bald
head

who was that the military governor himself was being asked at the
other side of the room how younglooking he is

yes and he is over sixty i hear the count no longer recognizes
anyone they wished to administer the sacrament of unction

i knew someone who received that sacrament seven times

the second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes red
from weeping and sat down beside dr lorrain who was sitting in a
graceful pose under a portrait of catherine leaning his elbow on a
table

beautiful said the doctor in answer to a remark about the weather
the weather is beautiful princess and besides in moscow one feels as
if one were in the country

yes indeed replied the princess with a sigh so he may have
something to drink

lorrain considered

has he taken his medicine

yes

the doctor glanced at his watch

take a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of tartar and
he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch

dere has neffer been a gase a german doctor was saying to an aidede
camp dat one liffs after de sird stroke

and what a wellpreserved man he was remarked the aidedecamp and
who will inherit his wealth he added in a whisper

it vont go begging replied the german with a smile

everyone again looked toward the door which creaked as the second
princess went in with the drink she had prepared according to lorrains
instructions the german doctor went up to lorrain

do you think he can last till morning asked the german addressing
lorrain in french which he pronounced badly

lorrain pursing up his lips waved a severely negative finger before
his nose

tonight not later said he in a low voice and he moved away with a
decorous smile of selfsatisfaction at being able clearly to understand
and state the patients condition

meanwhile prince vasíli had opened the door into the princess room

in this room it was almost dark only two tiny lamps were burning before
the icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastilles
the room was crowded with small pieces of furniture whatnots
cupboards and little tables the quilt of a high white feather bed was
just visible behind a screen a small dog began to bark

ah is it you cousin

she rose and smoothed her hair which was as usual so extremely smooth
that it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and covered with
varnish

has anything happened she asked i am so terrified

no there is no change i only came to have a talk about business
catiche muttered the prince seating himself wearily on the chair she
had just vacated you have made the place warm i must say he
remarked well sit down lets have a talk

catherine

i thought perhaps something had happened she said with her unchanging
stonily severe expression and sitting down opposite the prince she
prepared to listen

i wished to get a nap mon cousin but i cant

well my dear said prince vasíli taking her hand and bending it
downwards as was his habit

it was plain that this well referred to much that they both
understood without naming

the princess who had a straight rigid body abnormally long for her
legs looked directly at prince vasíli with no sign of emotion in her
prominent gray eyes then she shook her head and glanced up at the icons
with a sigh this might have been taken as an expression of sorrow and
devotion or of weariness and hope of resting before long prince vasíli
understood it as an expression of weariness

and i he said do you think it is easier for me i am as worn out as
a post horse but still i must have a talk with you catiche a very
serious talk

prince vasíli said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously now
on one side now on the other giving his face an unpleasant expression
which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room his eyes too seemed
strange at one moment they looked impudently sly and at the next
glanced round in alarm

the princess holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony
hands looked attentively into prince vasílis eyes evidently resolved
not to be the first to break silence if she had to wait till morning

well you see my dear princess and cousin catherine semënovna
continued prince vasíli returning to his theme apparently not without
an inner struggle at such a moment as this one must think of
everything one must think of the future of all of you i love you
all like children of my own as you know

the princess continued to look at him without moving and with the same
dull expression

and then of course my family has also to be considered prince vasíli
went on testily pushing away a little table without looking at her
you know catiche that weyou three sisters mámontov and my wifeare
the counts only direct heirs i know i know how hard it is for you to
talk or think of such matters it is no easier for me but my dear i
am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for anything do you know i
have sent for pierre the count pointing to his portrait definitely
demanded that he should be called

prince vasíli looked questioningly at the princess but could not make
out whether she was considering what he had just said or whether she was
simply looking at him

there is one thing i constantly pray god to grant mon cousin she
replied and it is that he would be merciful to him and would allow his
noble soul peacefully to leave this

yes yes of course interrupted prince vasíli impatiently rubbing
his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little table that
he had pushed away but in short the fact is you know yourself
that last winter the count made a will by which he left all his
property not to us his direct heirs but to pierre

he has made wills enough quietly remarked the princess but he
cannot leave the estate to pierre pierre is illegitimate

but my dear said prince vasíli suddenly clutching the little table
and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly what if a letter
has been written to the emperor in which the count asks for pierres
legitimation do you understand that in consideration of the counts
services his request would be granted

the princess smiled as people do who think they know more about the
subject under discussion than those they are talking with

i can tell you more continued prince vasíli seizing her hand that
letter was written though it was not sent and the emperor knew of it
the only question is has it been destroyed or not if not then as soon
as all is over and prince vasíli sighed to intimate what he meant by
the words all is over and the counts papers are opened the will and
letter will be delivered to the emperor and the petition will certainly
be granted pierre will get everything as the legitimate son

and our share asked the princess smiling ironically as if anything
might happen only not that

but my poor catiche it is as clear as daylight he will then be the
legal heir to everything and you wont get anything you must know my
dear whether the will and letter were written and whether they have
been destroyed or not and if they have somehow been overlooked you
ought to know where they are and must find them because

what next the princess interrupted smiling sardonically and not
changing the expression of her eyes i am a woman and you think we are
all stupid but i know this an illegitimate son cannot inherit un
bâtard she added as if supposing that this translation of the word
would effectively prove to prince vasíli the invalidity of his
contention

 a bastard

well really catiche cant you understand you are so intelligent
how is it you dont see that if the count has written a letter to the
emperor begging him to recognize pierre as legitimate it follows that
pierre will not be pierre but will become count bezúkhov and will then
inherit everything under the will and if the will and letter are not
destroyed then you will have nothing but the consolation of having been
dutiful et tout ce qui sensuit thats certain

 and all that follows therefrom

i know the will was made but i also know that it is invalid and you
mon cousin seem to consider me a perfect fool said the princess with
the expression women assume when they suppose they are saying something
witty and stinging

my dear princess catherine semënovna began prince vasíli impatiently
i came here not to wrangle with you but to talk about your interests
as with a kinswoman a good kind true relation and i tell you for the
tenth time that if the letter to the emperor and the will in pierres
favor are among the counts papers then my dear girl you and your
sisters are not heiresses if you dont believe me then believe an
expert i have just been talking to dmítri onúfrich the family
solicitor and he says the same

at this a sudden change evidently took place in the princess ideas her
thin lips grew white though her eyes did not change and her voice when
she began to speak passed through such transitions as she herself
evidently did not expect

that would be a fine thing said she i never wanted anything and i
dont now

she pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dress

and this is gratitudethis is recognition for those who have sacrificed
everything for his sake she cried its splendid fine i dont want
anything prince

yes but you are not the only one there are your sisters replied
prince vasíli

but the princess did not listen to him

yes i knew it long ago but had forgotten i knew that i could expect
nothing but meanness deceit envy intrigue and ingratitudethe
blackest ingratitudein this house

do you or do you not know where that will is insisted prince vasíli
his cheeks twitching more than ever

yes i was a fool i still believed in people loved them and
sacrificed myself but only the base the vile succeed i know who has
been intriguing

the princess wished to rise but the prince held her by the hand she
had the air of one who has suddenly lost faith in the whole human race
she gave her companion an angry glance

there is still time my dear you must remember catiche that it was
all done casually in a moment of anger of illness and was afterwards
forgotten our duty my dear is to rectify his mistake to ease his
last moments by not letting him commit this injustice and not to let
him die feeling that he is rendering unhappy those who

who sacrificed everything for him chimed in the princess who would
again have risen had not the prince still held her fast though he
never could appreciate it no mon cousin she added with a sigh i
shall always remember that in this world one must expect no reward that
in this world there is neither honor nor justice in this world one has
to be cunning and cruel

now come come be reasonable i know your excellent heart

no i have a wicked heart

i know your heart repeated the prince i value your friendship and
wish you to have as good an opinion of me dont upset yourself and let
us talk sensibly while there is still time be it a day or be it but an
hour tell me all you know about the will and above all where it is
you must know we will take it at once and show it to the count he has
no doubt forgotten it and will wish to destroy it you understand that
my sole desire is conscientiously to carry out his wishes that is my
only reason for being here i came simply to help him and you

now i see it all i know who has been intriguingi know cried the
princess

thats not the point my dear

its that protégé of yours that sweet princess drubetskáya that anna
mikháylovna whom i would not take for a housemaid the infamous vile
woman

do not let us lose any time

ah dont talk to me last winter she wheedled herself in here and told
the count such vile disgraceful things about us especially about
sophiei cant repeat themthat it made the count quite ill and he would
not see us for a whole fortnight i know it was then he wrote this vile
infamous paper but i thought the thing was invalid

weve got to it at lastwhy did you not tell me about it sooner

its in the inlaid portfolio that he keeps under his pillow said the
princess ignoring his question now i know yes if i have a sin a
great sin it is hatred of that vile woman almost shrieked the
princess now quite changed and what does she come worming herself in
here for but i will give her a piece of my mind the time will come





chapter xxii

while these conversations were going on in the reception room and the
princess room a carriage containing pierre who had been sent for and
anna mikháylovna who found it necessary to accompany him was driving
into the court of count bezúkhovs house as the wheels rolled softly
over the straw beneath the windows anna mikháylovna having turned with
words of comfort to her companion realized that he was asleep in his
corner and woke him up rousing himself pierre followed anna
mikháylovna out of the carriage and only then began to think of the
interview with his dying father which awaited him he noticed that they
had not come to the front entrance but to the back door while he was
getting down from the carriage steps two men who looked like
tradespeople ran hurriedly from the entrance and hid in the shadow of
the wall pausing for a moment pierre noticed several other men of the
same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides but neither
anna mikháylovna nor the footman nor the coachman who could not help
seeing these people took any notice of them it seems to be all
right pierre concluded and followed anna mikháylovna she hurriedly
ascended the narrow dimly lit stone staircase calling to pierre who
was lagging behind to follow though he did not see why it was
necessary for him to go to the count at all still less why he had to go
by the back stairs yet judging by anna mikháylovnas air of assurance
and haste pierre concluded that it was all absolutely necessary
halfway up the stairs they were almost knocked over by some men who
carrying pails came running downstairs their boots clattering these
men pressed close to the wall to let pierre and anna mikháylovna pass
and did not evince the least surprise at seeing them there

is this the way to the princesses apartments asked anna mikháylovna
of one of them

yes replied a footman in a bold loud voice as if anything were now
permissible the door to the left maam

perhaps the count did not ask for me said pierre when he reached the
landing id better go to my own room

anna mikháylovna paused and waited for him to come up

ah my friend she said touching his arm as she had done her sons
when speaking to him that afternoon believe me i suffer no less than
you do but be a man

but really hadnt i better go away he asked looking kindly at her
over his spectacles

ah my dear friend forget the wrongs that may have been done you
think that he is your father  perhaps in the agony of death she
sighed i have loved you like a son from the first trust yourself to
me pierre i shall not forget your interests

pierre did not understand a word but the conviction that all this had
to be grew stronger and he meekly followed anna mikháylovna who was
already opening a door

this door led into a back anteroom an old man a servant of the
princesses sat in a corner knitting a stocking pierre had never been
in this part of the house and did not even know of the existence of
these rooms anna mikháylovna addressing a maid who was hurrying past
with a decanter on a tray as my dear and my sweet asked about the
princess health and then led pierre along a stone passage the first
door on the left led into the princesses apartments the maid with the
decanter in her haste had not closed the door everything in the house
was done in haste at that time and pierre and anna mikháylovna in
passing instinctively glanced into the room where prince vasíli and the
eldest princess were sitting close together talking seeing them pass
prince vasíli drew back with obvious impatience while the princess
jumped up and with a gesture of desperation slammed the door with all
her might

this action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear depicted on
prince vasílis face so out of keeping with his dignity that pierre
stopped and glanced inquiringly over his spectacles at his guide anna
mikháylovna evinced no surprise she only smiled faintly and sighed as
if to say that this was no more than she had expected

be a man my friend i will look after your interests said she in
reply to his look and went still faster along the passage

pierre could not make out what it was all about and still less what
watching over his interests meant but he decided that all these
things had to be from the passage they went into a large dimly lit
room adjoining the counts reception room it was one of those sumptuous
but cold apartments known to pierre only from the front approach but
even in this room there now stood an empty bath and water had been
spilled on the carpet they were met by a deacon with a censer and by a
servant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them they went into
the reception room familiar to pierre with two italian windows opening
into the conservatory with its large bust and full length portrait of
catherine the great the same people were still sitting here in almost
the same positions as before whispering to one another all became
silent and turned to look at the pale tearworn anna mikháylovna as she
entered and at the big stout figure of pierre who hanging his head
meekly followed her

anna mikháylovnas face expressed a consciousness that the decisive
moment had arrived with the air of a practical petersburg lady she now
keeping pierre close beside her entered the room even more boldly than
that afternoon she felt that as she brought with her the person the
dying man wished to see her own admission was assured casting a rapid
glance at all those in the room and noticing the counts confessor
there she glided up to him with a sort of amble not exactly bowing yet
seeming to grow suddenly smaller and respectfully received the blessing
first of one and then of another priest

god be thanked that you are in time said she to one of the priests
all we relatives have been in such anxiety this young man is the
counts son she added more softly what a terrible moment

having said this she went up to the doctor

dear doctor said she this young man is the counts son is there
any hope

the doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged his
shoulders anna mikháylovna with just the same movement raised her
shoulders and eyes almost closing the latter sighed and moved away
from the doctor to pierre to him in a particularly respectful and
tenderly sad voice she said

trust in his mercy and pointing out a small sofa for him to sit and
wait for her she went silently toward the door that everyone was
watching and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind it

pierre having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly moved
toward the sofa she had indicated as soon as anna mikháylovna had
disappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned to him
with something more than curiosity and sympathy he noticed that they
whispered to one another casting significant looks at him with a kind
of awe and even servility a deference such as he had never before
received was shown him a strange lady the one who had been talking to
the priests rose and offered him her seat an aidedecamp picked up
and returned a glove pierre had dropped the doctors became respectfully
silent as he passed by and moved to make way for him at first pierre
wished to take another seat so as not to trouble the lady and also to
pick up the glove himself and to pass round the doctors who were not
even in his way but all at once he felt that this would not do and
that tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort of awful rite
which everyone expected of him and that he was therefore bound to
accept their services he took the glove in silence from the aidede
camp and sat down in the ladys chair placing his huge hands
symmetrically on his knees in the naïve attitude of an egyptian statue
and decided in his own mind that all was as it should be and that in
order not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act on his
own ideas tonight but must yield himself up entirely to the will of
those who were guiding him

not two minutes had passed before prince vasíli with head erect
majestically entered the room he was wearing his long coat with three
stars on his breast he seemed to have grown thinner since the morning
his eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and noticed
pierre he went up to him took his hand a thing he never used to do
and drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain whether it was firmly
fixed on

courage courage my friend he has asked to see you that is well
and he turned to go

but pierre thought it necessary to ask how is and hesitated not
knowing whether it would be proper to call the dying man the count
yet ashamed to call him father

he had another stroke about half an hour ago courage my friend

pierres mind was in such a confused state that the word stroke
suggested to him a blow from something he looked at prince vasíli in
perplexity and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of
illness prince vasíli said something to lorrain in passing and went
through the door on tiptoe he could not walk well on tiptoe and his
whole body jerked at each step the eldest princess followed him and
the priests and deacons and some servants also went in at the door
through that door was heard a noise of things being moved about and at
last anna mikháylovna still with the same expression pale but resolute
in the discharge of duty ran out and touching pierre lightly on the arm
said

the divine mercy is inexhaustible unction is about to be administered
come

pierre went in at the door stepping on the soft carpet and noticed
that the strange lady the aidedecamp and some of the servants all
followed him in as if there were now no further need for permission to
enter that room





chapter xxiii

pierre well knew this large room divided by columns and an arch its
walls hung round with persian carpets the part of the room behind the
columns with a high silkcurtained mahogany bedstead on one side and on
the other an immense case containing icons was brightly illuminated
with red light like a russian church during evening service under the
gleaming icons stood a long invalid chair and in that chair on snowy
white smooth pillows evidently freshly changed pierre sawcovered to
the waist by a bright green quiltthe familiar majestic figure of his
father count bezúkhov with that gray mane of hair above his broad
forehead which reminded one of a lion and the deep characteristically
noble wrinkles of his handsome ruddy face he lay just under the icons
his large thick hands outside the quilt into the right hand which was
lying palm downwards a wax taper had been thrust between forefinger and
thumb and an old servant bending over from behind the chair held it
in position by the chair stood the priests their long hair falling
over their magnificent glittering vestments with lighted tapers in
their hands slowly and solemnly conducting the service a little behind
them stood the two younger princesses holding handkerchiefs to their
eyes and just in front of them their eldest sister catiche with a
vicious and determined look steadily fixed on the icons as though
declaring to all that she could not answer for herself should she glance
round anna mikháylovna with a meek sorrowful and allforgiving
expression on her face stood by the door near the strange lady prince
vasíli in front of the door near the invalid chair a wax taper in his
left hand was leaning his left arm on the carved back of a velvet chair
he had turned round for the purpose and was crossing himself with his
right hand turning his eyes upward each time he touched his forehead
his face wore a calm look of piety and resignation to the will of god
if you do not understand these sentiments he seemed to be saying so
much the worse for you

behind him stood the aidedecamp the doctors and the menservants the
men and women had separated as in church all were silently crossing
themselves and the reading of the church service the subdued chanting
of deep bass voices and in the intervals sighs and the shuffling of
feet were the only sounds that could be heard anna mikháylovna with an
air of importance that showed that she felt she quite knew what she was
about went across the room to where pierre was standing and gave him a
taper he lit it and distracted by observing those around him began
crossing himself with the hand that held the taper

sophie the rosy laughterloving youngest princess with the mole
watched him she smiled hid her face in her handkerchief and remained
with it hidden for awhile then looking up and seeing pierre she again
began to laugh she evidently felt unable to look at him without
laughing but could not resist looking at him so to be out of
temptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns in the midst
of the service the voices of the priests suddenly ceased they whispered
to one another and the old servant who was holding the counts hand got
up and said something to the ladies anna mikháylovna stepped forward
and stooping over the dying man beckoned to lorrain from behind her
back the french doctor held no taper he was leaning against one of the
columns in a respectful attitude implying that he a foreigner in spite
of all differences of faith understood the full importance of the rite
now being performed and even approved of it he now approached the sick
man with the noiseless step of one in full vigor of life with his
delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the hand that was
free and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflected a moment the
sick man was given something to drink there was a stir around him then
the people resumed their places and the service continued during this
interval pierre noticed that prince vasíli left the chair on which he
had been leaning andwith an air which intimated that he knew what he
was about and if others did not understand him it was so much the worse
for themdid not go up to the dying man but passed by him joined the
eldest princess and moved with her to the side of the room where stood
the high bedstead with its silken hangings on leaving the bed both
prince vasíli and the princess passed out by a back door but returned
to their places one after the other before the service was concluded
pierre paid no more attention to this occurrence than to the rest of
what went on having made up his mind once for all that what he saw
happening around him that evening was in some way essential

the chanting of the service ceased and the voice of the priest was
heard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received the
sacrament the dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as before around
him everyone began to stir steps were audible and whispers among which
anna mikháylovnas was the most distinct

pierre heard her say

certainly he must be moved onto the bed here it will be impossible

the sick man was so surrounded by doctors princesses and servants that
pierre could no longer see the reddishyellow face with its gray
manewhich though he saw other faces as well he had not lost sight of
for a single moment during the whole service he judged by the cautious
movements of those who crowded round the invalid chair that they had
lifted the dying man and were moving him

catch hold of my arm or youll drop him he heard one of the servants
say in a frightened whisper catch hold from underneath here
exclaimed different voices and the heavy breathing of the bearers and
the shuffling of their feet grew more hurried as if the weight they
were carrying were too much for them

as the bearers among whom was anna mikháylovna passed the young man he
caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the dying
mans high stout uncovered chest and powerful shoulders raised by
those who were holding him under the armpits and of his gray curly
leonine head this head with its remarkably broad brow and cheekbones
its handsome sensual mouth and its cold majestic expression was not
disfigured by the approach of death it was the same as pierre
remembered it three months before when the count had sent him to
petersburg but now this head was swaying helplessly with the uneven
movements of the bearers and the cold listless gaze fixed itself upon
nothing

after a few minutes bustle beside the high bedstead those who had
carried the sick man dispersed anna mikháylovna touched pierres hand
and said come pierre went with her to the bed on which the sick man
had been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony just
completed he lay with his head propped high on the pillows his hands
were symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt the palms downward
when pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him but with a
look the significance of which could not be understood by mortal man
either this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes they
must look somewhere or it meant too much pierre hesitated not knowing
what to do and glanced inquiringly at his guide anna mikháylovna made
a hurried sign with her eyes glancing at the sick mans hand and moving
her lips as if to send it a kiss pierre carefully stretching his neck
so as not to touch the quilt followed her suggestion and pressed his
lips to the large boned fleshy hand neither the hand nor a single
muscle of the counts face stirred once more pierre looked
questioningly at anna mikháylovna to see what he was to do next anna
mikháylovna with her eyes indicated a chair that stood beside the bed
pierre obediently sat down his eyes asking if he were doing right anna
mikháylovna nodded approvingly again pierre fell into the naïvely
symmetrical pose of an egyptian statue evidently distressed that his
stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing his utmost to look
as small as possible he looked at the count who still gazed at the
spot where pierres face had been before he sat down anna mikháylovna
indicated by her attitude her consciousness of the pathetic importance
of these last moments of meeting between the father and son this lasted
about two minutes which to pierre seemed an hour suddenly the broad
muscles and lines of the counts face began to twitch the twitching
increased the handsome mouth was drawn to one side only now did pierre
realize how near death his father was and from that distorted mouth
issued an indistinct hoarse sound anna mikháylovna looked attentively
at the sick mans eyes trying to guess what he wanted she pointed
first to pierre then to some drink then named prince vasíli in an
inquiring whisper then pointed to the quilt the eyes and face of the
sick man showed impatience he made an effort to look at the servant who
stood constantly at the head of the bed

wants to turn on the other side whispered the servant and got up to
turn the counts heavy body toward the wall

pierre rose to help him

while the count was being turned over one of his arms fell back
helplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward whether he
noticed the look of terror with which pierre regarded that lifeless arm
or whether some other thought flitted across his dying brain at any
rate he glanced at the refractory arm at pierres terrorstricken face
and again at the arm and on his face a feeble piteous smile appeared
quite out of keeping with his features that seemed to deride his own
helplessness at sight of this smile pierre felt an unexpected quivering
in his breast and a tickling in his nose and tears dimmed his eyes the
sick man was turned on to his side with his face to the wall he sighed

he is dozing said anna mikháylovna observing that one of the
princesses was coming to take her turn at watching let us go

pierre went out





chapter xxiv

there was now no one in the reception room except prince vasíli and the
eldest princess who were sitting under the portrait of catherine the
great and talking eagerly as soon as they saw pierre and his companion
they became silent and pierre thought he saw the princess hide
something as she whispered

i cant bear the sight of that woman

catiche has had tea served in the small drawing room said prince
vasíli to anna mikháylovna go and take something my poor anna
mikháylovna or you will not hold out

to pierre he said nothing merely giving his arm a sympathetic squeeze
below the shoulder pierre went with anna mikháylovna into the small
drawing room

there is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup of this
delicious russian tea lorrain was saying with an air of restrained
animation as he stood sipping tea from a delicate chinese handleless cup
before a table on which tea and a cold supper were laid in the small
circular room around the table all who were at count bezúkhovs house
that night had gathered to fortify themselves pierre well remembered
this small circular drawing room with its mirrors and little tables
during balls given at the house pierre who did not know how to dance
had liked sitting in this room to watch the ladies who as they passed
through in their ball dresses with diamonds and pearls on their bare
shoulders looked at themselves in the brilliantly lighted mirrors which
repeated their reflections several times now this same room was dimly
lighted by two candles on one small table tea things and supper dishes
stood in disorder and in the middle of the night a motley throng of
people sat there not merrymaking but somberly whispering and
betraying by every word and movement that they none of them forgot what
was happening and what was about to happen in the bedroom pierre did
not eat anything though he would very much have liked to he looked
inquiringly at his monitress and saw that she was again going on tiptoe
to the reception room where they had left prince vasíli and the eldest
princess pierre concluded that this also was essential and after a
short interval followed her anna mikháylovna was standing beside the
princess and they were both speaking in excited whispers

permit me princess to know what is necessary and what is not
necessary said the younger of the two speakers evidently in the same
state of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her room

but my dear princess answered anna mikháylovna blandly but
impressively blocking the way to the bedroom and preventing the other
from passing wont this be too much for poor uncle at a moment when he
needs repose worldly conversation at a moment when his soul is already
prepared

prince vasíli was seated in an easy chair in his familiar attitude with
one leg crossed high above the other his cheeks which were so flabby
that they looked heavier below were twitching violently but he wore
the air of a man little concerned in what the two ladies were saying

come my dear anna mikháylovna let catiche do as she pleases you know
how fond the count is of her

i dont even know what is in this paper said the younger of the two
ladies addressing prince vasíli and pointing to an inlaid portfolio she
held in her hand all i know is that his real will is in his writing
table and this is a paper he has forgotten

she tried to pass anna mikháylovna but the latter sprang so as to bar
her path

i know my dear kind princess said anna mikháylovna seizing the
portfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easily dear
princess i beg and implore you have some pity on him je vous en
conjure

the princess did not reply their efforts in the struggle for the
portfolio were the only sounds audible but it was evident that if the
princess did speak her words would not be flattering to anna
mikháylovna though the latter held on tenaciously her voice lost none
of its honeyed firmness and softness

pierre my dear come here i think he will not be out of place in a
family consultation is it not so prince

why dont you speak cousin suddenly shrieked the princess so loud
that those in the drawing room heard her and were startled why do you
remain silent when heaven knows who permits herself to interfere making
a scene on the very threshold of a dying mans room intriguer she
hissed viciously and tugged with all her might at the portfolio

but anna mikháylovna went forward a step or two to keep her hold on the
portfolio and changed her grip

prince vasíli rose oh said he with reproach and surprise this is
absurd come let go i tell you

the princess let go

and you too

but anna mikháylovna did not obey him

let go i tell you i will take the responsibility i myself will go
and ask him i does that satisfy you

but prince said anna mikháylovna after such a solemn sacrament
allow him a moments peace here pierre tell them your opinion said
she turning to the young man who having come quite close was gazing
with astonishment at the angry face of the princess which had lost all
dignity and at the twitching cheeks of prince vasíli

remember that you will answer for the consequences said prince vasíli
severely you dont know what you are doing

vile woman shouted the princess darting unexpectedly at anna
mikháylovna and snatching the portfolio from her

prince vasíli bent his head and spread out his hands

at this moment that terrible door which pierre had watched so long and
which had always opened so quietly burst noisily open and banged
against the wall and the second of the three sisters rushed out
wringing her hands

what are you doing she cried vehemently he is dying and you leave
me alone with him

her sister dropped the portfolio anna mikháylovna stooping quickly
caught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom the eldest
princess and prince vasíli recovering themselves followed her a few
minutes later the eldest sister came out with a pale hard face again
biting her underlip at sight of pierre her expression showed an
irrepressible hatred

yes now you may be glad said she this is what you have been
waiting for and bursting into tears she hid her face in her
handkerchief and rushed from the room

prince vasíli came next he staggered to the sofa on which pierre was
sitting and dropped onto it covering his face with his hand pierre
noticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook as if in an
ague

ah my friend said he taking pierre by the elbow and there was in
his voice a sincerity and weakness pierre had never observed in it
before how often we sin how much we deceive and all for what i am
near sixty dear friend i too all will end in death all death is
awful and he burst into tears

anna mikháylovna came out last she approached pierre with slow quiet
steps

pierre she said

pierre gave her an inquiring look she kissed the young man on his
forehead wetting him with her tears then after a pause she said

he is no more

pierre looked at her over his spectacles

come i will go with you try to weep nothing gives such relief as
tears

she led him into the dark drawing room and pierre was glad no one could
see his face anna mikháylovna left him and when she returned he was
fast asleep with his head on his arm

in the morning anna mikháylovna said to pierre

yes my dear this is a great loss for us all not to speak of you but
god will support you you are young and are now i hope in command of
an immense fortune the will has not yet been opened i know you well
enough to be sure that this will not turn your head but it imposes
duties on you and you must be a man

pierre was silent

perhaps later on i may tell you my dear boy that if i had not been
there god only knows what would have happened you know uncle promised
me only the day before yesterday not to forget borís but he had no
time i hope my dear friend you will carry out your fathers wish

pierre understood nothing of all this and coloring shyly looked in
silence at princess anna mikháylovna after her talk with pierre anna
mikháylovna returned to the rostóvs and went to bed on waking in the
morning she told the rostóvs and all her acquaintances the details of
count bezúkhovs death she said the count had died as she would herself
wish to die that his end was not only touching but edifying as to the
last meeting between father and son it was so touching that she could
not think of it without tears and did not know which had behaved better
during those awful momentsthe father who so remembered everything and
everybody at last and had spoken such pathetic words to the son or
pierre whom it had been pitiful to see so stricken was he with grief
though he tried hard to hide it in order not to sadden his dying father
it is painful but it does one good it uplifts the soul to see such
men as the old count and his worthy son said she of the behavior of
the eldest princess and prince vasíli she spoke disapprovingly but in
whispers and as a great secret





chapter xxv

at bald hills prince nicholas andréevich bolkónskis estate the
arrival of young prince andrew and his wife was daily expected but this
expectation did not upset the regular routine of life in the old
princes household general in chief prince nicholas andréevich
nicknamed in society the king of prussia ever since the emperor
paul had exiled him to his country estate had lived there continuously
with his daughter princess mary and her companion mademoiselle
bourienne though in the new reign he was free to return to the
capitals he still continued to live in the country remarking that
anyone who wanted to see him could come the hundred miles from moscow to
bald hills while he himself needed no one and nothing he used to say
that there are only two sources of human viceidleness and superstition
and only two virtuesactivity and intelligence he himself undertook his
daughters education and to develop these two cardinal virtues in her
gave her lessons in algebra and geometry till she was twenty and
arranged her life so that her whole time was occupied he was himself
always occupied writing his memoirs solving problems in higher
mathematics turning snuffboxes on a lathe working in the garden or
superintending the building that was always going on at his estate as
regularity is a prime condition facilitating activity regularity in his
household was carried to the highest point of exactitude he always came
to table under precisely the same conditions and not only at the same
hour but at the same minute with those about him from his daughter to
his serfs the prince was sharp and invariably exacting so that without
being a hardhearted man he inspired such fear and respect as few
hardhearted men would have aroused although he was in retirement and
had now no influence in political affairs every high official appointed
to the province in which the princes estate lay considered it his duty
to visit him and waited in the lofty antechamber just as the architect
gardener or princess mary did till the prince appeared punctually to
the appointed hour everyone sitting in this antechamber experienced the
same feeling of respect and even fear when the enormously high study
door opened and showed the figure of a rather small old man with
powdered wig small withered hands and bushy gray eyebrows which when
he frowned sometimes hid the gleam of his shrewd youthfully glittering
eyes

on the morning of the day that the young couple were to arrive princess
mary entered the antechamber as usual at the time appointed for the
morning greeting crossing herself with trepidation and repeating a
silent prayer every morning she came in like that and every morning
prayed that the daily interview might pass off well

an old powdered manservant who was sitting in the antechamber rose
quietly and said in a whisper please walk in

through the door came the regular hum of a lathe the princess timidly
opened the door which moved noiselessly and easily she paused at the
entrance the prince was working at the lathe and after glancing round
continued his work

the enormous study was full of things evidently in constant use the
large table covered with books and plans the tall glassfronted
bookcases with keys in the locks the high desk for writing while
standing up on which lay an open exercise book and the lathe with
tools laid ready to hand and shavings scattered aroundall indicated
continuous varied and orderly activity the motion of the small foot
shod in a tartar boot embroidered with silver and the firm pressure of
the lean sinewy hand showed that the prince still possessed the
tenacious endurance and vigor of hardy old age after a few more turns
of the lathe he removed his foot from the pedal wiped his chisel
dropped it into a leather pouch attached to the lathe and approaching
the table summoned his daughter he never gave his children a blessing
so he simply held out his bristly cheek as yet unshaven and regarding
her tenderly and attentively said severely

quite well all right then sit down he took the exercise book
containing lessons in geometry written by himself and drew up a chair
with his foot

for tomorrow said he quickly finding the page and making a scratch
from one paragraph to another with his hard nail

the princess bent over the exercise book on the table

wait a bit heres a letter for you said the old man suddenly taking
a letter addressed in a womans hand from a bag hanging above the table
onto which he threw it

at the sight of the letter red patches showed themselves on the
princess face she took it quickly and bent her head over it

from héloïse asked the prince with a cold smile that showed his still
sound yellowish teeth

yes its from julie replied the princess with a timid glance and a
timid smile

ill let two more letters pass but the third ill read said the
prince sternly im afraid you write much nonsense ill read the
third

read this if you like father said the princess blushing still more
and holding out the letter

the third i said the third cried the prince abruptly pushing the
letter away and leaning his elbows on the table he drew toward him the
exercise book containing geometrical figures

well madam he began stooping over the book close to his daughter
and placing an arm on the back of the chair on which she sat so that
she felt herself surrounded on all sides by the acrid scent of old age
and tobacco which she had known so long now madam these triangles
are equal please note that the angle abc

the princess looked in a scared way at her fathers eyes glittering
close to her the red patches on her face came and went and it was
plain that she understood nothing and was so frightened that her fear
would prevent her understanding any of her fathers further
explanations however clear they might be whether it was the teachers
fault or the pupils this same thing happened every day the princess
eyes grew dim she could not see and could not hear anything but was
only conscious of her stern fathers withered face close to her of his
breath and the smell of him and could think only of how to get away
quickly to her own room to make out the problem in peace the old man
was beside himself moved the chair on which he was sitting noisily
backward and forward made efforts to control himself and not become
vehement but almost always did become vehement scolded and sometimes
flung the exercise book away

the princess gave a wrong answer

well now isnt she a fool shouted the prince pushing the book aside
and turning sharply away but rising immediately he paced up and down
lightly touched his daughters hair and sat down again

he drew up his chair and continued to explain

this wont do princess it wont do said he when princess mary
having taken and closed the exercise book with the next days lesson
was about to leave mathematics are most important madam i dont want
to have you like our silly ladies get used to it and youll like it
and he patted her cheek it will drive all the nonsense out of your
head

she turned to go but he stopped her with a gesture and took an uncut
book from the high desk

here is some sort of key to the mysteries that your héloïse has sent
you religious i dont interfere with anyones belief i have looked
at it take it well now go go

he patted her on the shoulder and himself closed the door after her

princess mary went back to her room with the sad scared expression that
rarely left her and which made her plain sickly face yet plainer she
sat down at her writing table on which stood miniature portraits and
which was littered with books and papers the princess was as untidy as
her father was tidy she put down the geometry book and eagerly broke
the seal of her letter it was from her most intimate friend from
childhood that same julie karágina who had been at the rostóvs name
day party

julie wrote in french

dear and precious friend how terrible and frightful a thing is
separation though i tell myself that half my life and half my happiness
are wrapped up in you and that in spite of the distance separating us
our hearts are united by indissoluble bonds my heart rebels against
fate and in spite of the pleasures and distractions around me i cannot
overcome a certain secret sorrow that has been in my heart ever since we
parted why are we not together as we were last summer in your big
study on the blue sofa the confidential sofa why cannot i now as
three months ago draw fresh moral strength from your look so gentle
calm and penetrating a look i loved so well and seem to see before me
as i write

having read thus far princess mary sighed and glanced into the mirror
which stood on her right it reflected a weak ungraceful figure and
thin face her eyes always sad now looked with particular hopelessness
at her reflection in the glass she flatters me thought the princess
turning away and continuing to read but julie did not flatter her
friend the princess eyeslarge deep and luminous it seemed as if at
times there radiated from them shafts of warm lightwere so beautiful
that very often in spite of the plainness of her face they gave her an
attraction more powerful than that of beauty but the princess never saw
the beautiful expression of her own eyesthe look they had when she was
not thinking of herself as with everyone her face assumed a forced
unnatural expression as soon as she looked in a glass she went on
reading

all moscow talks of nothing but war one of my two brothers is already
abroad the other is with the guards who are starting on their march to
the frontier our dear emperor has left petersburg and it is thought
intends to expose his precious person to the chances of war god grant
that the corsican monster who is destroying the peace of europe may be
overthrown by the angel whom it has pleased the almighty in his
goodness to give us as sovereign to say nothing of my brothers this
war has deprived me of one of the associations nearest my heart i mean
young nicholas rostóv who with his enthusiasm could not bear to remain
inactive and has left the university to join the army i will confess to
you dear mary that in spite of his extreme youth his departure for the
army was a great grief to me this young man of whom i spoke to you
last summer is so nobleminded and full of that real youthfulness which
one seldom finds nowadays among our old men of twenty and particularly
he is so frank and has so much heart he is so pure and poetic that my
relations with him transient as they were have been one of the
sweetest comforts to my poor heart which has already suffered so much
someday i will tell you about our parting and all that was said then
that is still too fresh ah dear friend you are happy not to know
these poignant joys and sorrows you are fortunate for the latter are
generally the stronger i know very well that count nicholas is too
young ever to be more to me than a friend but this sweet friendship
this poetic and pure intimacy were what my heart needed but enough of
this the chief news about which all moscow gossips is the death of
old count bezúkhov and his inheritance fancy the three princesses
have received very little prince vasíli nothing and it is monsieur
pierre who has inherited all the property and has besides been
recognized as legitimate so that he is now count bezúkhov and possessor
of the finest fortune in russia it is rumored that prince vasíli played
a very despicable part in this affair and that he returned to petersburg
quite crestfallen

i confess i understand very little about all these matters of wills and
inheritance but i do know that since this young man whom we all used
to know as plain monsieur pierre has become count bezúkhov and the
owner of one of the largest fortunes in russia i am much amused to
watch the change in the tone and manners of the mammas burdened by
marriageable daughters and of the young ladies themselves toward him
though between you and me he always seemed to me a poor sort of
fellow as for the past two years people have amused themselves by
finding husbands for me most of whom i dont even know the
matchmaking chronicles of moscow now speak of me as the future countess
bezúkhova but you will understand that i have no desire for the post à
propos of marriages do you know that a while ago that universal auntie
anna mikháylovna told me under the seal of strict secrecy of a plan of
marriage for you it is neither more nor less than with prince vasílis
son anatole whom they wish to reform by marrying him to someone rich
and distinguée and it is on you that his relations choice has fallen
i dont know what you will think of it but i consider it my duty to let
you know of it he is said to be very handsome and a terrible
scapegrace that is all i have been able to find out about him

but enough of gossip i am at the end of my second sheet of paper and
mamma has sent for me to go and dine at the apráksins read the
mystical book i am sending you it has an enormous success here though
there are things in it difficult for the feeble human mind to grasp it
is an admirable book which calms and elevates the soul adieu give my
respects to monsieur your father and my compliments to mademoiselle
bourienne i embrace you as i love you

julie

ps let me have news of your brother and his charming little wife

the princess pondered awhile with a thoughtful smile and her luminous
eyes lit up so that her face was entirely transformed then she suddenly
rose and with her heavy tread went up to the table she took a sheet of
paper and her hand moved rapidly over it this is the reply she wrote
also in french

dear and precious friend your letter of the th has given me great
delight so you still love me my romantic julie separation of which
you say so much that is bad does not seem to have had its usual effect
on you you complain of our separation what then should i say if i
dared complain i who am deprived of all who are dear to me ah if we
had not religion to console us life would be very sad why do you
suppose that i should look severely on your affection for that young
man on such matters i am only severe with myself i understand such
feelings in others and if never having felt them i cannot approve of
them neither do i condemn them only it seems to me that christian
love love of ones neighbor love of ones enemy is worthier sweeter
and better than the feelings which the beautiful eyes of a young man can
inspire in a romantic and loving young girl like yourself

the news of count bezúkhovs death reached us before your letter and my
father was much affected by it he says the count was the last
representative but one of the great century and that it is his own turn
now but that he will do all he can to let his turn come as late as
possible god preserve us from that terrible misfortune

i cannot agree with you about pierre whom i knew as a child he always
seemed to me to have an excellent heart and that is the quality i value
most in people as to his inheritance and the part played by prince
vasíli it is very sad for both ah my dear friend our divine
saviours words that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of
a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god are terribly
true i pity prince vasíli but am still more sorry for pierre so young
and burdened with such richesto what temptations he will be exposed if
i were asked what i desire most on earth it would be to be poorer than
the poorest beggar a thousand thanks dear friend for the volume you
have sent me and which has such success in moscow yet since you tell me
that among some good things it contains others which our weak human
understanding cannot grasp it seems to me rather useless to spend time
in reading what is unintelligible and can therefore bear no fruit i
never could understand the fondness some people have for confusing their
minds by dwelling on mystical books that merely awaken their doubts and
excite their imagination giving them a bent for exaggeration quite
contrary to christian simplicity let us rather read the epistles and
gospels let us not seek to penetrate what mysteries they contain for
how can we miserable sinners that we are know the terrible and holy
secrets of providence while we remain in this flesh which forms an
impenetrable veil between us and the eternal let us rather confine
ourselves to studying those sublime rules which our divine saviour has
left for our guidance here below let us try to conform to them and
follow them and let us be persuaded that the less we let our feeble
human minds roam the better we shall please god who rejects all
knowledge that does not come from him and the less we seek to fathom
what he has been pleased to conceal from us the sooner will he
vouchsafe its revelation to us through his divine spirit

my father has not spoken to me of a suitor but has only told me that he
has received a letter and is expecting a visit from prince vasíli in
regard to this project of marriage for me i will tell you dear sweet
friend that i look on marriage as a divine institution to which we must
conform however painful it may be to me should the almighty lay the
duties of wife and mother upon me i shall try to perform them as
faithfully as i can without disquieting myself by examining my feelings
toward him whom he may give me for husband

i have had a letter from my brother who announces his speedy arrival at
bald hills with his wife this pleasure will be but a brief one
however for he will leave us again to take part in this unhappy war
into which we have been drawn god knows how or why not only where you
areat the heart of affairs and of the worldis the talk all of war
even here amid fieldwork and the calm of naturewhich townsfolk consider
characteristic of the countryrumors of war are heard and painfully
felt my father talks of nothing but marches and countermarches things
of which i understand nothing and the day before yesterday during my
daily walk through the village i witnessed a heartrending scene it
was a convoy of conscripts enrolled from our people and starting to join
the army you should have seen the state of the mothers wives and
children of the men who were going and should have heard the sobs it
seems as though mankind has forgotten the laws of its divine saviour
who preached love and forgiveness of injuriesand that men attribute the
greatest merit to skill in killing one another

adieu dear and kind friend may our divine saviour and his most holy
mother keep you in their holy and allpowerful care

mary

ah you are sending off a letter princess i have already dispatched
mine i have written to my poor mother said the smiling mademoiselle
bourienne rapidly in her pleasant mellow tones and with guttural rs
she brought into princess marys strenuous mournful and gloomy world a
quite different atmosphere careless lighthearted and selfsatisfied

princess i must warn you she added lowering her voice and evidently
listening to herself with pleasure and speaking with exaggerated
grasseyement the prince has been scolding michael ivánovich he is in
a very bad humor very morose be prepared

ah dear friend replied princess mary i have asked you never to
warn me of the humor my father is in i do not allow myself to judge him
and would not have others do so

the princess glanced at her watch and seeing that she was five minutes
late in starting her practice on the clavichord went into the sitting
room with a look of alarm between twelve and two oclock as the day
was mapped out the prince rested and the princess played the
clavichord





chapter xxvi

the grayhaired valet was sitting drowsily listening to the snoring of
the prince who was in his large study from the far side of the house
through the closed doors came the sound of difficult passagestwenty
times repeatedof a sonata by dussek

just then a closed carriage and another with a hood drove up to the
porch prince andrew got out of the carriage helped his little wife to
alight and let her pass into the house before him old tíkhon wearing
a wig put his head out of the door of the antechamber reported in a
whisper that the prince was sleeping and hastily closed the door
tíkhon knew that neither the sons arrival nor any other unusual event
must be allowed to disturb the appointed order of the day prince andrew
apparently knew this as well as tíkhon he looked at his watch as if to
ascertain whether his fathers habits had changed since he was at home
last and having assured himself that they had not he turned to his
wife

he will get up in twenty minutes let us go across to marys room he
said

the little princess had grown stouter during this time but her eyes and
her short downy smiling lip lifted when she began to speak just as
merrily and prettily as ever

why this is a palace she said to her husband looking around with
the expression with which people compliment their host at a ball lets
come quick quick and with a glance round she smiled at tíkhon at
her husband and at the footman who accompanied them

is that mary practicing lets go quietly and take her by surprise

prince andrew followed her with a courteous but sad expression

youve grown older tíkhon he said in passing to the old man who
kissed his hand

before they reached the room from which the sounds of the clavichord
came the pretty fairhaired frenchwoman mademoiselle bourienne
rushed out apparently beside herself with delight

ah what joy for the princess exclaimed she at last i must let her
know

no no please not you are mademoiselle bourienne said the little
princess kissing her i know you already through my sisterinlaws
friendship for you she was not expecting us

they went up to the door of the sitting room from which came the sound
of the oftrepeated passage of the sonata prince andrew stopped and
made a grimace as if expecting something unpleasant

the little princess entered the room the passage broke off in the
middle a cry was heard then princess marys heavy tread and the sound
of kissing when prince andrew went in the two princesses who had only
met once before for a short time at his wedding were in each others
arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they happened to
touch mademoiselle bourienne stood near them pressing her hand to her
heart with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready to cry or to
laugh prince andrew shrugged his shoulders and frowned as lovers of
music do when they hear a false note the two women let go of one
another and then as if afraid of being too late seized each others
hands kissing them and pulling them away and again began kissing each
other on the face and then to prince andrews surprise both began to
cry and kissed again mademoiselle bourienne also began to cry prince
andrew evidently felt ill at ease but to the two women it seemed quite
natural that they should cry and apparently it never entered their
heads that it could have been otherwise at this meeting

ah my dear ah mary they suddenly exclaimed and then
laughed i dreamed last nightyou were not expecting us ah
mary you have got thinner and you have grown stouter

i knew the princess at once put in mademoiselle bourienne

and i had no idea exclaimed princess mary ah andrew i did not
see you

prince andrew and his sister hand in hand kissed one another and he
told her she was still the same crybaby as ever princess mary had
turned toward her brother and through her tears the loving warm
gentle look of her large luminous eyes very beautiful at that moment
rested on prince andrews face

the little princess talked incessantly her short downy upper lip
continually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when necessary and
drawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile of
glittering teeth and sparkling eyes she told of an accident they had
had on the spásski hill which might have been serious for her in her
condition and immediately after that informed them that she had left
all her clothes in petersburg and that heaven knew what she would have
to dress in here and that andrew had quite changed and that kitty
odýntsova had married an old man and that there was a suitor for mary
a real one but that they would talk of that later princess mary was
still looking silently at her brother and her beautiful eyes were full
of love and sadness it was plain that she was following a train of
thought independent of her sisterinlaws words in the midst of a
description of the last petersburg fete she addressed her brother

so you are really going to the war andrew she said sighing

lise sighed too

yes and even tomorrow replied her brother

he is leaving me here god knows why when he might have had
promotion

princess mary did not listen to the end but continuing her train of
thought turned to her sisterinlaw with a tender glance at her figure

is it certain she said

the face of the little princess changed she sighed and said yes
quite certain ah it is very dreadful

her lip descended she brought her face close to her sisterinlaws and
unexpectedly again began to cry

she needs rest said prince andrew with a frown dont you lise
take her to your room and ill go to father how is he just the same

yes just the same though i dont know what your opinion will be
answered the princess joyfully

and are the hours the same and the walks in the avenues and the
lathe asked prince andrew with a scarcely perceptible smile which
showed that in spite of all his love and respect for his father he was
aware of his weaknesses

the hours are the same and the lathe and also the mathematics and my
geometry lessons said princess mary gleefully as if her lessons in
geometry were among the greatest delights of her life

when the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for the old
prince to get up tíkhon came to call the young prince to his father
the old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor of his
sons arrival he gave orders to admit him to his apartments while he
dressed for dinner the old prince always dressed in oldfashioned
style wearing an antique coat and powdered hair and when prince andrew
entered his fathers dressing room not with the contemptuous look and
manner he wore in drawing rooms but with the animated face with which
he talked to pierre the old man was sitting on a large leathercovered
chair wrapped in a powdering mantle entrusting his head to tíkhon

ah heres the warrior wants to vanquish buonaparte said the old
man shaking his powdered head as much as the tail which tíkhon was
holding fast to plait would allow

you at least must tackle him properly or else if he goes on like this
hell soon have us too for his subjects how are you and he held out
his cheek

the old man was in a good temper after his nap before dinner he used
to say that a nap after dinner was silverbefore dinner golden he
cast happy sidelong glances at his son from under his thick bushy
eyebrows prince andrew went up and kissed his father on the spot
indicated to him he made no reply on his fathers favorite topicmaking
fun of the military men of the day and more particularly of bonaparte

yes father i have come to you and brought my wife who is pregnant
said prince andrew following every movement of his fathers face with
an eager and respectful look how is your health

only fools and rakes fall ill my boy you know me i am busy from
morning till night and abstemious so of course i am well

thank god said his son smiling

god has nothing to do with it well go on he continued returning to
his hobby tell me how the germans have taught you to fight bonaparte
by this new science you call strategy

prince andrew smiled

give me time to collect my wits father said he with a smile that
showed that his fathers foibles did not prevent his son from loving and
honoring him why i have not yet had time to settle down

nonsense nonsense cried the old man shaking his pigtail to see
whether it was firmly plaited and grasping his by the hand the house
for your wife is ready princess mary will take her there and show her
over and theyll talk nineteen to the dozen thats their womans way
i am glad to have her sit down and talk about mikhelsons army i
understandtolstóy s too a simultaneous expedition but whats
the southern army to do prussia is neutral i know that what about
austria said he rising from his chair and pacing up and down the room
followed by tíkhon who ran after him handing him different articles of
clothing what of sweden how will they cross pomerania

prince andrew seeing that his father insisted beganat first
reluctantly but gradually with more and more animation and from habit
changing unconsciously from russian to french as he went onto explain
the plan of operation for the coming campaign he explained how an army
ninety thousand strong was to threaten prussia so as to bring her out
of her neutrality and draw her into the war how part of that army was
to join some swedish forces at stralsund how two hundred and twenty
thousand austrians with a hundred thousand russians were to operate in
italy and on the rhine how fifty thousand russians and as many english
were to land at naples and how a total force of five hundred thousand
men was to attack the french from different sides the old prince did
not evince the least interest during this explanation but as if he were
not listening to it continued to dress while walking about and three
times unexpectedly interrupted once he stopped it by shouting the
white one the white one

this meant that tíkhon was not handing him the waistcoat he wanted
another time he interrupted saying

and will she soon be confined and shaking his head reproachfully
said thats bad go on go on

the third interruption came when prince andrew was finishing his
description the old man began to sing in the cracked voice of old age
malbrook sen vaten guerre dieu sait quand reviendra

 marlborough is going to the wars god knows when hell return

his son only smiled

i dont say its a plan i approve of said the son i am only telling
you what it is napoleon has also formed his plan by now not worse than
this one

well youve told me nothing new and the old man repeated
meditatively and rapidly

dieu sait quand reviendra go to the dining room





chapter xxvii

at the appointed hour the prince powdered and shaven entered the
dining room where his daughterinlaw princess mary and mademoiselle
bourienne were already awaiting him together with his architect who by
a strange caprice of his employers was admitted to table though the
position of that insignificant individual was such as could certainly
not have caused him to expect that honor the prince who generally kept
very strictly to social distinctions and rarely admitted even important
government officials to his table had unexpectedly selected michael
ivánovich who always went into a corner to blow his nose on his checked
handkerchief to illustrate the theory that all men are equals and had
more than once impressed on his daughter that michael ivánovich was not
a whit worse than you or i at dinner the prince usually spoke to the
taciturn michael ivánovich more often than to anyone else

in the dining room which like all the rooms in the house was
exceedingly lofty the members of the household and the footmenone
behind each chairstood waiting for the prince to enter the head
butler napkin on arm was scanning the setting of the table making
signs to the footmen and anxiously glancing from the clock to the door
by which the prince was to enter prince andrew was looking at a large
gilt frame new to him containing the genealogical tree of the princes
bolkónski opposite which hung another such frame with a badly painted
portrait evidently by the hand of the artist belonging to the estate
of a ruling prince in a crownan alleged descendant of rúrik and
ancestor of the bolkónskis prince andrew looking again at that
genealogical tree shook his head laughing as a man laughs who looks at
a portrait so characteristic of the original as to be amusing

how thoroughly like him that is he said to princess mary who had
come up to him

princess mary looked at her brother in surprise she did not understand
what he was laughing at everything her father did inspired her with
reverence and was beyond question

everyone has his achilles heel continued prince andrew fancy with
his powerful mind indulging in such nonsense

princess mary could not understand the boldness of her brothers
criticism and was about to reply when the expected footsteps were heard
coming from the study the prince walked in quickly and jauntily as was
his wont as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his manners
with the strict formality of his house at that moment the great clock
struck two and another with a shrill tone joined in from the drawing
room the prince stood still his lively glittering eyes from under
their thick bushy eyebrows sternly scanned all present and rested on
the little princess she felt as courtiers do when the tsar enters the
sensation of fear and respect which the old man inspired in all around
him he stroked her hair and then patted her awkwardly on the back of
her neck

im glad glad to see you he said looking attentively into her
eyes and then quickly went to his place and sat down sit down sit
down sit down michael ivánovich

he indicated a place beside him to his daughterinlaw a footman moved
the chair for her

ho ho said the old man casting his eyes on her rounded figure
youve been in a hurry thats bad

he laughed in his usual dry cold unpleasant way with his lips only
and not with his eyes

you must walk walk as much as possible as much as possible he said

the little princess did not or did not wish to hear his words she was
silent and seemed confused the prince asked her about her father and
she began to smile and talk he asked about mutual acquaintances and
she became still more animated and chattered away giving him greetings
from various people and retelling the town gossip

countess apráksina poor thing has lost her husband and she has cried
her eyes out she said growing more and more lively

as she became animated the prince looked at her more and more sternly
and suddenly as if he had studied her sufficiently and had formed a
definite idea of her he turned away and addressed michael ivánovich

well michael ivánovich our bonaparte will be having a bad time of it
prince andrew he always spoke thus of his son has been telling me
what forces are being collected against him while you and i never
thought much of him

michael ivánovich did not at all know when you and i had said such
things about bonaparte but understanding that he was wanted as a peg on
which to hang the princes favorite topic he looked inquiringly at the
young prince wondering what would follow

he is a great tactician said the prince to his son pointing to the
architect

and the conversation again turned on the war on bonaparte and the
generals and statesmen of the day the old prince seemed convinced not
only that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know the a
b c of war or of politics and that bonaparte was an insignificant
little frenchy successful only because there were no longer any
potëmkins or suvórovs left to oppose him but he was also convinced that
there were no political difficulties in europe and no real war but only
a sort of puppet show at which the men of the day were playing
pretending to do something real prince andrew gaily bore with his
fathers ridicule of the new men and drew him on and listened to him
with evident pleasure

the past always seems good said he but did not suvórov himself fall
into a trap moreau set him and from which he did not know how to
escape

who told you that who cried the prince suvórov and he jerked
away his plate which tíkhon briskly caught suvórov consider
prince andrew two frederick and suvórov moreau moreau would
have been a prisoner if suvórov had had a free hand but he had the
hofskriegswurstschnappsrath on his hands it would have puzzled the
devil himself when you get there youll find out what those hofs
kriegswurstraths are suvórov couldnt manage them so what chance has
michael kutúzov no my dear boy he continued you and your generals
wont get on against buonaparte youll have to call in the french so
that birds of a feather may fight together the german pahlen has been
sent to new york in america to fetch the frenchman moreau he said
alluding to the invitation made that year to moreau to enter the russian
service wonderful were the potëmkins suvórovs and orlóvs
germans no lad either you fellows have all lost your wits or i have
outlived mine may god help you but well see what will happen
buonaparte has become a great commander among them hm

i dont at all say that all the plans are good said prince andrew i
am only surprised at your opinion of bonaparte you may laugh as much as
you like but all the same bonaparte is a great general

michael ivánovich cried the old prince to the architect who busy
with his roast meat hoped he had been forgotten didnt i tell you
buonaparte was a great tactician here he says the same thing

to be sure your excellency replied the architect

the prince again laughed his frigid laugh

buonaparte was born with a silver spoon in his mouth he has got
splendid soldiers besides he began by attacking germans and only
idlers have failed to beat the germans since the world began everybody
has beaten the germans they beat no oneexcept one another he made his
reputation fighting them

and the prince began explaining all the blunders which according to
him bonaparte had made in his campaigns and even in politics his son
made no rejoinder but it was evident that whatever arguments were
presented he was as little able as his father to change his opinion he
listened refraining from a reply and involuntarily wondered how this
old man living alone in the country for so many years could know and
discuss so minutely and acutely all the recent european military and
political events

you think im an old man and dont understand the present state of
affairs concluded his father but it troubles me i dont sleep at
night come now where has this great commander of yours shown his
skill he concluded

that would take too long to tell answered the son

well then go off to your buonaparte mademoiselle bourienne heres
another admirer of that powdermonkey emperor of yours he exclaimed in
excellent french

you know prince i am not a bonapartist

dieu sait quand reviendra hummed the prince out of tune and with a
laugh still more so he quitted the table

the little princess during the whole discussion and the rest of the
dinner sat silent glancing with a frightened look now at her fatherin
law and now at princess mary when they left the table she took her
sisterinlaws arm and drew her into another room

what a clever man your father is said she perhaps that is why i am
afraid of him

oh he is so kind answered princess mary





chapter xxviii

prince andrew was to leave next evening the old prince not altering
his routine retired as usual after dinner the little princess was in
her sisterinlaws room prince andrew in a traveling coat without
epaulettes had been packing with his valet in the rooms assigned to him
after inspecting the carriage himself and seeing the trunks put in he
ordered the horses to be harnessed only those things he always kept
with him remained in his room a small box a large canteen fitted with
silver plate two turkish pistols and a sabera present from his father
who had brought it from the siege of ochákov all these traveling
effects of prince andrews were in very good order new clean and in
cloth covers carefully tied with tapes

when starting on a journey or changing their mode of life men capable
of reflection are generally in a serious frame of mind at such moments
one reviews the past and plans for the future prince andrews face
looked very thoughtful and tender with his hands behind him he paced
briskly from corner to corner of the room looking straight before him
and thoughtfully shaking his head did he fear going to the war or was
he sad at leaving his wifeperhaps both but evidently he did not wish
to be seen in that mood for hearing footsteps in the passage he
hurriedly unclasped his hands stopped at a table as if tying the cover
of the small box and assumed his usual tranquil and impenetrable
expression it was the heavy tread of princess mary that he heard

i hear you have given orders to harness she cried panting she had
apparently been running and i did so wish to have another talk with
you alone god knows how long we may again be parted you are not angry
with me for coming you have changed so andrúsha she added as if to
explain such a question

she smiled as she uttered his pet name andrúsha it was obviously
strange to her to think that this stern handsome man should be
andrúshathe slender mischievous boy who had been her playfellow in
childhood

and where is lise he asked answering her question only by a smile

she was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room oh
andrew what a treasure of a wife you have said she sitting down on
the sofa facing her brother she is quite a child such a dear merry
child i have grown so fond of her

prince andrew was silent but the princess noticed the ironical and
contemptuous look that showed itself on his face

one must be indulgent to little weaknesses who is free from them
andrew dont forget that she has grown up and been educated in society
and so her position now is not a rosy one we should enter into
everyones situation tout comprendre cest tout pardonner  think
what it must be for her poor thing after what she has been used to to
be parted from her husband and be left alone in the country in her
condition its very hard

 to understand all is to forgive all

prince andrew smiled as he looked at his sister as we smile at those we
think we thoroughly understand

you live in the country and dont think the life terrible he replied

i thats different why speak of me i dont want any other life
and cant for i know no other but think andrew for a young society
woman to be buried in the country during the best years of her life all
alonefor papa is always busy and i well you know what poor
resources i have for entertaining a woman used to the best society
there is only mademoiselle bourienne

i dont like your mademoiselle bourienne at all said prince andrew

no she is very nice and kind and above all shes much to be pitied
she has no one no one to tell the truth i dont need her and shes
even in my way you know i always was a savage and now am even more so
i like being alone father likes her very much she and michael
ivánovich are the two people to whom he is always gentle and kind
because he has been a benefactor to them both as sterne says we dont
love people so much for the good they have done us as for the good we
have done them father took her when she was homeless after losing her
own father she is very goodnatured and my father likes her way of
reading she reads to him in the evenings and reads splendidly

to be quite frank mary i expect fathers character sometimes makes
things trying for you doesnt it prince andrew asked suddenly

princess mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question

for me for me trying for me said she

he always was rather harsh and now i should think hes getting very
trying said prince andrew apparently speaking lightly of their father
in order to puzzle or test his sister

you are good in every way andrew but you have a kind of intellectual
pride said the princess following the train of her own thoughts
rather than the trend of the conversationand thats a great sin how
can one judge father but even if one might what feeling except
veneration could such a man as my father evoke and i am so contented
and happy with him i only wish you were all as happy as i am

her brother shook his head incredulously

the only thing that is hard for me i will tell you the truth
andrew is fathers way of treating religious subjects i dont
understand how a man of his immense intellect can fail to see what is as
clear as day and can go so far astray that is the only thing that
makes me unhappy but even in this i can see lately a shade of
improvement his satire has been less bitter of late and there was a
monk he received and had a long talk with

ah my dear i am afraid you and your monk are wasting your powder
said prince andrew banteringly yet tenderly

ah mon ami i only pray and hope that god will hear me andrew
she said timidly after a moments silence i have a great favor to ask
of you

what is it dear

nopromise that you will not refuse it will give you no trouble and is
nothing unworthy of you but it will comfort me promise andrúsha
said she putting her hand in her reticule but not yet taking out what
she was holding inside it as if what she held were the subject of her
request and must not be shown before the request was granted

she looked timidly at her brother

even if it were a great deal of trouble answered prince andrew as
if guessing what it was about

think what you please i know you are just like father think as you
please but do this for my sake please do fathers father our
grandfather wore it in all his wars she still did not take out what
she was holding in her reticule so you promise

of course what is it

andrew i bless you with this icon and you must promise me you will
never take it off do you promise

if it does not weigh a hundredweight and wont break my neck to
please you said prince andrew but immediately noticing the pained
expression his joke had brought to his sisters face he repented and
added i am glad really dear i am very glad

against your will he will save and have mercy on you and bring you to
himself for in him alone is truth and peace said she in a voice
trembling with emotion solemnly holding up in both hands before her
brother a small oval antique darkfaced icon of the saviour in a gold
setting on a finely wrought silver chain

she crossed herself kissed the icon and handed it to andrew

please andrew for my sake

rays of gentle light shone from her large timid eyes those eyes lit up
the whole of her thin sickly face and made it beautiful her brother
would have taken the icon but she stopped him andrew understood
crossed himself and kissed the icon there was a look of tenderness for
he was touched but also a gleam of irony on his face

thank you my dear she kissed him on the forehead and sat down again
on the sofa they were silent for a while

as i was saying to you andrew be kind and generous as you always used
to be dont judge lise harshly she began she is so sweet so good
natured and her position now is a very hard one

i do not think i have complained of my wife to you másha or blamed
her why do you say all this to me

red patches appeared on princess marys face and she was silent as if
she felt guilty

i have said nothing to you but you have already been talked to and i
am sorry for that he went on

the patches grew deeper on her forehead neck and cheeks she tried to
say something but could not her brother had guessed right the little
princess had been crying after dinner and had spoken of her forebodings
about her confinement and how she dreaded it and had complained of her
fate her fatherinlaw and her husband after crying she had fallen
asleep prince andrew felt sorry for his sister

know this másha i cant reproach have not reproached and never
shall reproach my wife with anything and i cannot reproach myself with
anything in regard to her and that always will be so in whatever
circumstances i may be placed but if you want to know the truth if
you want to know whether i am happy no is she happy no but why this
is so i dont know

as he said this he rose went to his sister and stooping kissed her
forehead his fine eyes lit up with a thoughtful kindly and
unaccustomed brightness but he was looking not at his sister but over
her head toward the darkness of the open doorway

let us go to her i must say goodby orgo and wake and ill come in a
moment petrúshka he called to his valet come here take these away
put this on the seat and this to the right

princess mary rose and moved to the door then stopped and said
andrew if you had faith you would have turned to god and asked him to
give you the love you do not feel and your prayer would have been
answered

well maybe said prince andrew go másha ill come immediately

on the way to his sisters room in the passage which connected one wing
with the other prince andrew met mademoiselle bourienne smiling
sweetly it was the third time that day that with an ecstatic and
artless smile she had met him in secluded passages

oh i thought you were in your room she said for some reason
blushing and dropping her eyes

prince andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of anger suddenly
came over his face he said nothing to her but looked at her forehead
and hair without looking at her eyes with such contempt that the
frenchwoman blushed and went away without a word when he reached his
sisters room his wife was already awake and her merry voice hurrying
one word after another came through the open door she was speaking as
usual in french and as if after long selfrestraint she wished to make
up for lost time

no but imagine the old countess zúbova with false curls and her mouth
full of false teeth as if she were trying to cheat old age ha ha
ha mary

this very sentence about countess zúbova and this same laugh prince
andrew had already heard from his wife in the presence of others some
five times he entered the room softly the little princess plump and
rosy was sitting in an easy chair with her work in her hands talking
incessantly repeating petersburg reminiscences and even phrases prince
andrew came up stroked her hair and asked if she felt rested after
their journey she answered him and continued her chatter

the coach with six horses was waiting at the porch it was an autumn
night so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole
servants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch the immense
house was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windows the
domestic serfs were crowding in the hall waiting to bid goodby to the
young prince the members of the household were all gathered in the
reception hall michael ivánovich mademoiselle bourienne princess
mary and the little princess prince andrew had been called to his
fathers study as the latter wished to say goodby to him alone all
were waiting for them to come out

when prince andrew entered the study the old man in his oldage
spectacles and white dressing gown in which he received no one but his
son sat at the table writing he glanced round

going and he went on writing

ive come to say goodby

kiss me here and he touched his cheek thanks thanks

what do you thank me for

for not dillydallying and not hanging to a womans apron strings the
service before everything thanks thanks and he went on writing so
that his quill spluttered and squeaked if you have anything to say
say it these two things can be done together he added

about my wife i am ashamed as it is to leave her on your hands

why talk nonsense say what you want

when her confinement is due send to moscow for an accoucheur let
him be here

the old prince stopped writing and as if not understanding fixed his
stern eyes on his son

i know that no one can help if nature does not do her work said
prince andrew evidently confused i know that out of a million cases
only one goes wrong but it is her fancy and mine they have been
telling her things she has had a dream and is frightened

hm hm muttered the old prince to himself finishing what he was
writing ill do it

he signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to his son began to
laugh

its a bad business eh

what is bad father

the wife said the old prince briefly and significantly

i dont understand said prince andrew

no it cant be helped lad said the prince theyre all like that
one cant unmarry dont be afraid i wont tell anyone but you know it
yourself

he seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers shook it looked
straight into his sons face with keen eyes which seemed to see through
him and again laughed his frigid laugh

the son sighed thus admitting that his father had understood him the
old man continued to fold and seal his letter snatching up and throwing
down the wax the seal and the paper with his accustomed rapidity

whats to be done shes pretty i will do everything make your mind
easy said he in abrupt sentences while sealing his letter

andrew did not speak he was both pleased and displeased that his father
understood him the old man got up and gave the letter to his son

listen said he dont worry about your wife what can be done shall
be now listen give this letter to michael ilariónovich  i have
written that he should make use of you in proper places and not keep you
long as an adjutant a bad position tell him i remember and like him
write and tell me how he receives you if he is all rightserve him
nicholas bolkónskis son need not serve under anyone if he is in
disfavor now come here

kutúzov

he spoke so rapidly that he did not finish half his words but his son
was accustomed to understand him he led him to the desk raised the
lid drew out a drawer and took out an exercise book filled with his
bold tall close handwriting

i shall probably die before you so remember these are my memoirs
hand them to the emperor after my death now here is a lombard bond and
a letter it is a premium for the man who writes a history of suvórovs
wars send it to the academy here are some jottings for you to read
when i am gone you will find them useful

andrew did not tell his father that he would no doubt live a long time
yet he felt that he must not say it

i will do it all father he said

well now goodby he gave his son his hand to kiss and embraced
him remember this prince andrew if they kill you it will hurt me
your old father he paused unexpectedly and then in a querulous
voice suddenly shrieked but if i hear that you have not behaved like a
son of nicholas bolkónski i shall be ashamed

you need not have said that to me father said the son with a smile

the old man was silent

i also wanted to ask you continued prince andrew if im killed and
if i have a son do not let him be taken away from youas i said
yesterday let him grow up with you please

not let the wife have him said the old man and laughed

they stood silent facing one another the old mans sharp eyes were
fixed straight on his sons something twitched in the lower part of the
old princes face

weve said goodby go he suddenly shouted in a loud angry voice
opening his door

what is it what asked both princesses when they saw for a moment at
the door prince andrew and the figure of the old man in a white dressing
gown spectacled and wigless shouting in an angry voice

prince andrew sighed and made no reply

well he said turning to his wife

and this well sounded coldly ironic as if he were saying now go
through your performance

andrew already said the little princess turning pale and looking
with dismay at her husband

he embraced her she screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulder

he cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on looked into her face
and carefully placed her in an easy chair

adieu mary said he gently to his sister taking her by the hand and
kissing her and then he left the room with rapid steps

the little princess lay in the armchair mademoiselle bourienne chafing
her temples princess mary supporting her sisterinlaw still looked
with her beautiful eyes full of tears at the door through which prince
andrew had gone and made the sign of the cross in his direction from
the study like pistol shots came the frequent sound of the old man
angrily blowing his nose hardly had prince andrew gone when the study
door opened quickly and the stern figure of the old man in the white
dressing gown looked out

gone thats all right said he and looking angrily at the
unconscious little princess he shook his head reprovingly and slammed
the door





book two





chapter i

in october  a russian army was occupying the villages and towns of
the archduchy of austria and yet other regiments freshly arriving from
russia were settling near the fortress of braunau and burdening the
inhabitants on whom they were quartered braunau was the headquarters of
the commanderinchief kutúzov

on october   one of the infantry regiments that had just reached
braunau had halted half a mile from the town waiting to be inspected by
the commanderinchief despite the unrussian appearance of the
locality and surroundingsfruit gardens stone fences tiled roofs and
hills in the distanceand despite the fact that the inhabitants who
gazed with curiosity at the soldiers were not russians the regiment
had just the appearance of any russian regiment preparing for an
inspection anywhere in the heart of russia

on the evening of the last days march an order had been received that
the commanderinchief would inspect the regiment on the march though
the words of the order were not clear to the regimental commander and
the question arose whether the troops were to be in marching order or
not it was decided at a consultation between the battalion commanders
to present the regiment in parade order on the principle that it is
always better to bow too low than not bow low enough so the soldiers
after a twentymile march were kept mending and cleaning all night long
without closing their eyes while the adjutants and company commanders
calculated and reckoned and by morning the regimentinstead of the
straggling disorderly crowd it had been on its last march the day
beforepresented a wellordered array of two thousand men each of whom
knew his place and his duty had every button and every strap in place
and shone with cleanliness and not only externally was all in order
but had it pleased the commanderinchief to look under the uniforms he
would have found on every man a clean shirt and in every knapsack the
appointed number of articles awl soap and all as the soldiers say
there was only one circumstance concerning which no one could be at
ease it was the state of the soldiers boots more than half the mens
boots were in holes but this defect was not due to any fault of the
regimental commander for in spite of repeated demands boots had not
been issued by the austrian commissariat and the regiment had marched
some seven hundred miles

the commander of the regiment was an elderly choleric stout and
thickset general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers and wider from
chest to back than across the shoulders he had on a brandnew uniform
showing the creases where it had been folded and thick gold epaulettes
which seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massive shoulders he
had the air of a man happily performing one of the most solemn duties of
his life he walked about in front of the line and at every step pulled
himself up slightly arching his back it was plain that the commander
admired his regiment rejoiced in it and that his whole mind was
engrossed by it yet his strut seemed to indicate that besides military
matters social interests and the fair sex occupied no small part of his
thoughts

well michael mitrich sir he said addressing one of the battalion
commanders who smilingly pressed forward it was plain that they both
felt happy we had our hands full last night however i think the
regiment is not a bad one eh

the battalion commander perceived the jovial irony and laughed

it would not be turned off the field even on the tsaritsin meadow

what asked the commander

at that moment on the road from the town on which signalers had been
posted two men appeared on horse back they were an aidedecamp
followed by a cossack

the aidedecamp was sent to confirm the order which had not been
clearly worded the day before namely that the commanderinchief
wished to see the regiment just in the state in which it had been on the
march in their greatcoats and packs and without any preparation
whatever

a member of the hofkriegsrath from vienna had come to kutúzov the day
before with proposals and demands for him to join up with the army of
the archduke ferdinand and mack and kutúzov not considering this
junction advisable meant among other arguments in support of his view
to show the austrian general the wretched state in which the troops
arrived from russia with this object he intended to meet the regiment
so the worse the condition it was in the better pleased the commander
inchief would be though the aidedecamp did not know these
circumstances he nevertheless delivered the definite order that the men
should be in their greatcoats and in marching order and that the
commanderinchief would otherwise be dissatisfied on hearing this the
regimental commander hung his head silently shrugged his shoulders and
spread out his arms with a choleric gesture

a fine mess weve made of it he remarked

there now didnt i tell you michael mitrich that if it was said on
the march it meant in greatcoats said he reproachfully to the
battalion commander oh my god he added stepping resolutely
forward company commanders he shouted in a voice accustomed to
command sergeants major how soon will he be here he asked the
aidedecamp with a respectful politeness evidently relating to the
personage he was referring to

in an hours time i should say

shall we have time to change clothes

i dont know general

the regimental commander going up to the line himself ordered the
soldiers to change into their greatcoats the company commanders ran off
to their companies the sergeants major began bustling the greatcoats
were not in very good condition and instantly the squares that had up
to then been in regular order and silent began to sway and stretch and
hum with voices on all sides soldiers were running to and fro throwing
up their knapsacks with a jerk of their shoulders and pulling the straps
over their heads unstrapping their overcoats and drawing the sleeves on
with upraised arms

in half an hour all was again in order only the squares had become gray
instead of black the regimental commander walked with his jerky steps
to the front of the regiment and examined it from a distance

whatever is this this he shouted and stood still commander of the
third company

commander of the third company wanted by the general commander to
the general third company to the commander the words passed along
the lines and an adjutant ran to look for the missing officer

when the eager but misrepeated words had reached their destination in a
cry of the general to the third company the missing officer appeared
from behind his company and though he was a middleaged man and not in
the habit of running trotted awkwardly stumbling on his toes toward the
general the captains face showed the uneasiness of a schoolboy who is
told to repeat a lesson he has not learned spots appeared on his nose
the redness of which was evidently due to intemperance and his mouth
twitched nervously the general looked the captain up and down as he
came up panting slackening his pace as he approached

you will soon be dressing your men in petticoats what is this
shouted the regimental commander thrusting forward his jaw and pointing
at a soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat of bluish
cloth which contrasted with the others what have you been after the
commander in chief is expected and you leave your place eh ill teach
you to dress the men in fancy coats for a parade eh

the commander of the company with his eyes fixed on his superior
pressed two fingers more and more rigidly to his cap as if in this
pressure lay his only hope of salvation

well why dont you speak whom have you got there dressed up as a
hungarian said the commander with an austere gibe

your excellency

well your excellency what your excellency but what about your
excellency nobody knows

your excellency its the officer dólokhov who has been reduced to the
ranks said the captain softly

well has he been degraded into a field marshal or into a soldier if
a soldier he should be dressed in regulation uniform like the others

your excellency you gave him leave yourself on the march

gave him leave leave thats just like you young men said the
regimental commander cooling down a little leave indeed one says a
word to you and you what he added with renewed irritation i beg
you to dress your men decently

and the commander turning to look at the adjutant directed his jerky
steps down the line he was evidently pleased at his own display of
anger and walking up to the regiment wished to find a further excuse for
wrath having snapped at an officer for an unpolished badge at another
because his line was not straight he reached the third company

hoow are you standing wheres your leg your leg shouted the
commander with a tone of suffering in his voice while there were still
five men between him and dólokhov with his bluishgray uniform

dólokhov slowly straightened his bent knee looking straight with his
clear insolent eyes in the generals face

why a blue coat off with it sergeant major change his coat the
ras he did not finish

general i must obey orders but i am not bound to endure dólokhov
hurriedly interrupted

no talking in the ranks no talking no talking

not bound to endure insults dólokhov concluded in loud ringing
tones

the eyes of the general and the soldier met the general became silent
angrily pulling down his tight scarf

i request you to have the goodness to change your coat he said as he
turned away





chapter ii

hes coming shouted the signaler at that moment

the regimental commander flushing ran to his horse seized the stirrup
with trembling hands threw his body across the saddle righted himself
drew his saber and with a happy and resolute countenance opening his
mouth awry prepared to shout the regiment fluttered like a bird
preening its plumage and became motionless

attention shouted the regimental commander in a soulshaking voice
which expressed joy for himself severity for the regiment and welcome
for the approaching chief

along the broad country road edged on both sides by trees came a high
light blue viennese caleche slightly creaking on its springs and drawn
by six horses at a smart trot behind the caleche galloped the suite and
a convoy of croats beside kutúzov sat an austrian general in a white
uniform that looked strange among the russian black ones the caleche
stopped in front of the regiment kutúzov and the austrian general were
talking in low voices and kutúzov smiled slightly as treading heavily he
stepped down from the carriage just as if those two thousand men
breathlessly gazing at him and the regimental commander did not exist

the word of command rang out and again the regiment quivered as with a
jingling sound it presented arms then amidst a dead silence the feeble
voice of the commanderinchief was heard the regiment roared health
to your ex len len lency and again all became silent at
first kutúzov stood still while the regiment moved then he and the
general in white accompanied by the suite walked between the ranks

from the way the regimental commander saluted the commanderinchief and
devoured him with his eyes drawing himself up obsequiously and from
the way he walked through the ranks behind the generals bending forward
and hardly able to restrain his jerky movements and from the way he
darted forward at every word or gesture of the commanderinchief it
was evident that he performed his duty as a subordinate with even
greater zeal than his duty as a commander thanks to the strictness and
assiduity of its commander the regiment in comparison with others that
had reached braunau at the same time was in splendid condition there
were only  sick and stragglers everything was in good order except
the boots

kutúzov walked through the ranks sometimes stopping to say a few
friendly words to officers he had known in the turkish war sometimes
also to the soldiers looking at their boots he several times shook his
head sadly pointing them out to the austrian general with an expression
which seemed to say that he was not blaming anyone but could not help
noticing what a bad state of things it was the regimental commander ran
forward on each such occasion fearing to miss a single word of the
commanderinchiefs regarding the regiment behind kutúzov at a
distance that allowed every softly spoken word to be heard followed
some twenty men of his suite these gentlemen talked among themselves
and sometimes laughed nearest of all to the commanderinchief walked a
handsome adjutant this was prince bolkónski beside him was his comrade
nesvitski a tall staff officer extremely stout with a kindly
smiling handsome face and moist eyes nesvitski could hardly keep from
laughter provoked by a swarthy hussar officer who walked beside him
this hussar with a grave face and without a smile or a change in the
expression of his fixed eyes watched the regimental commanders back
and mimicked his every movement each time the commander started and
bent forward the hussar started and bent forward in exactly the same
manner nesvitski laughed and nudged the others to make them look at the
wag

kutúzov walked slowly and languidly past thousands of eyes which were
starting from their sockets to watch their chief on reaching the third
company he suddenly stopped his suite not having expected this
involuntarily came closer to him

ah timokhin said he recognizing the rednosed captain who had been
reprimanded on account of the blue greatcoat

one would have thought it impossible for a man to stretch himself more
than timokhin had done when he was reprimanded by the regimental
commander but now that the commanderinchief addressed him he drew
himself up to such an extent that it seemed he could not have sustained
it had the commanderinchief continued to look at him and so kutúzov
who evidently understood his case and wished him nothing but good
quickly turned away a scarcely perceptible smile flitting over his
scarred and puffy face

another ismail comrade said he a brave officer are you satisfied
with him he asked the regimental commander

and the latterunconscious that he was being reflected in the hussar
officer as in a looking glassstarted moved forward and answered
highly satisfied your excellency

we all have our weaknesses said kutúzov smiling and walking away from
him he used to have a predilection for bacchus

the regimental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this and did
not answer the hussar at that moment noticed the face of the rednosed
captain and his drawnin stomach and mimicked his expression and pose
with such exactitude that nesvitski could not help laughing kutúzov
turned round the officer evidently had complete control of his face
and while kutúzov was turning managed to make a grimace and then assume
a most serious deferential and innocent expression

the third company was the last and kutúzov pondered apparently trying
to recollect something prince andrew stepped forward from among the
suite and said in french

you told me to remind you of the officer dólokhov reduced to the ranks
in this regiment

where is dólokhov asked kutúzov

dólokhov who had already changed into a soldiers gray greatcoat did
not wait to be called the shapely figure of the fairhaired soldier
with his clear blue eyes stepped forward from the ranks went up to the
commander in chief and presented arms

have you a complaint to make kutúzov asked with a slight frown

this is dólokhov said prince andrew

ah said kutúzov i hope this will be a lesson to you do your duty
the emperor is gracious and i shant forget you if you deserve well

the clear blue eyes looked at the commanderinchief just as boldly as
they had looked at the regimental commander seeming by their expression
to tear open the veil of convention that separates a commanderinchief
so widely from a private

one thing i ask of your excellency dólokhov said in his firm
ringing deliberate voice i ask an opportunity to atone for my fault
and prove my devotion to his majesty the emperor and to russia

kutúzov turned away the same smile of the eyes with which he had turned
from captain timokhin again flitted over his face he turned away with a
grimace as if to say that everything dólokhov had said to him and
everything he could say had long been known to him that he was weary of
it and it was not at all what he wanted he turned away and went to the
carriage

the regiment broke up into companies which went to their appointed
quarters near braunau where they hoped to receive boots and clothes and
to rest after their hard marches

you wont bear me a grudge prokhor ignatych said the regimental
commander overtaking the third company on its way to its quarters and
riding up to captain timokhin who was walking in front the regimental
commanders face now that the inspection was happily over beamed with
irrepressible delight its in the emperors service it cant be
helped one is sometimes a bit hasty on parade i am the first to
apologize you know me he was very pleased and he held out his
hand to the captain

dont mention it general as if id be so bold replied the captain
his nose growing redder as he gave a smile which showed where two front
teeth were missing that had been knocked out by the butt end of a gun at
ismail

and tell mr dólokhov that i wont forget himhe may be quite easy and
tell me pleaseive been meaning to askhow is he behaving himself and
in general

as far as the service goes he is quite punctilious your excellency
but his character said timokhin

and what about his character asked the regimental commander

its different on different days answered the captain one day he is
sensible well educated and goodnatured and the next hes a wild
beast in poland if you please he nearly killed a jew

oh well well remarked the regimental commander still one must
have pity on a young man in misfortune you know he has important
connections well then you just

i will your excellency said timokhin showing by his smile that he
understood his commanders wish

well of course of course

the regimental commander sought out dólokhov in the ranks and reining
in his horse said to him

after the next affair epaulettes

dólokhov looked round but did not say anything nor did the mocking
smile on his lips change

well thats all right continued the regimental commander a cup of
vodka for the men from me he added so that the soldiers could hear i
thank you all god be praised and he rode past that company and
overtook the next one

well hes really a good fellow one can serve under him said
timokhin to the subaltern beside him

in a word a hearty one said the subaltern laughing the
regimental commander was nicknamed king of hearts

the cheerful mood of their officers after the inspection infected the
soldiers the company marched on gaily the soldiers voices could be
heard on every side

and they said kutúzov was blind of one eye

and so he is quite blind

no friend he is sharpereyed than you are boots and leg bands he
noticed everything

when he looked at my feet friend well thinks i

and that other one with him the austrian looked as if he were smeared
with chalkas white as flour i suppose they polish him up as they do
the guns

i say fedeshon did he say when the battles are to begin you were
near him everybody said that buonaparte himself was at braunau

buonaparte himself just listen to the fool what he doesnt know
the prussians are up in arms now the austrians you see are putting
them down when theyve been put down the war with buonaparte will
begin and he says buonaparte is in braunau shows youre a fool youd
better listen more carefully

what devils these quartermasters are see the fifth company is turning
into the village already they will have their buckwheat cooked before
we reach our quarters

give me a biscuit you devil

and did you give me tobacco yesterday thats just it friend ah
well never mind here you are

they might call a halt here or well have to do another four miles
without eating

wasnt it fine when those germans gave us lifts you just sit still and
are drawn along

and here friend the people are quite beggarly there they all seemed
to be polesall under the russian crownbut here theyre all regular
germans

singers to the front came the captains order

and from the different ranks some twenty men ran to the front a
drummer their leader turned round facing the singers and flourishing
his arm began a longdrawnout soldiers song commencing with the
words morning dawned the sun was rising and concluding on then
brothers on to glory led by father kamenski this song had been
composed in the turkish campaign and now being sung in austria the only
change being that the words father kamenski were replaced by father
kutúzov

having jerked out these last words as soldiers do and waved his arms as
if flinging something to the ground the drummera lean handsome
soldier of fortylooked sternly at the singers and screwed up his eyes
then having satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on him he raised
both arms as if carefully lifting some invisible but precious object
above his head and holding it there for some seconds suddenly flung it
down and began

oh my bower oh my bower

oh my bower new chimed in twenty voices and the castanet player
in spite of the burden of his equipment rushed out to the front and
walking backwards before the company jerked his shoulders and
flourished his castanets as if threatening someone the soldiers
swinging their arms and keeping time spontaneously marched with long
steps behind the company the sound of wheels the creaking of springs
and the tramp of horses hoofs were heard kutúzov and his suite were
returning to the town the commanderinchief made a sign that the men
should continue to march at ease and he and all his suite showed
pleasure at the sound of the singing and the sight of the dancing
soldier and the gay and smartly marching men in the second file from
the right flank beside which the carriage passed the company a blue
eyed soldier involuntarily attracted notice it was dólokhov marching
with particular grace and boldness in time to the song and looking at
those driving past as if he pitied all who were not at that moment
marching with the company the hussar cornet of kutúzovs suite who had
mimicked the regimental commander fell back from the carriage and rode
up to dólokhov

hussar cornet zherkov had at one time in petersburg belonged to the
wild set led by dólokhov zherkov had met dólokhov abroad as a private
and had not seen fit to recognize him but now that kutúzov had spoken
to the gentleman ranker he addressed him with the cordiality of an old
friend

my dear fellow how are you said he through the singing making his
horse keep pace with the company

how am i dólokhov answered coldly i am as you see

the lively song gave a special flavor to the tone of free and easy
gaiety with which zherkov spoke and to the intentional coldness of
dólokhovs reply

and how do you get on with the officers inquired zherkov

all right they are good fellows and how have you wriggled onto the
staff

i was attached im on duty

both were silent

she let the hawk fly upward from her wide right sleeve went the song
arousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness their
conversation would probably have been different but for the effect of
that song

is it true that austrians have been beaten asked dólokhov

the devil only knows they say so

im glad answered dólokhov briefly and clearly as the song demanded

i say come round some evening and well have a game of faro said
zherkov

why have you too much money

do come

i cant ive sworn not to i wont drink and wont play till i get
reinstated

well thats only till the first engagement

we shall see

they were again silent

come if you need anything one can at least be of use on the staff

dólokhov smiled dont trouble if i want anything i wont begill
take it

well never mind i only

and i only

goodbye

good health

its a long long way to my native land

zherkov touched his horse with the spurs it pranced excitedly from foot
to foot uncertain with which to start then settled down galloped past
the company and overtook the carriage still keeping time to the song





chapter iii

on returning from the review kutúzov took the austrian general into his
private room and calling his adjutant asked for some papers relating
to the condition of the troops on their arrival and the letters that
had come from the archduke ferdinand who was in command of the advanced
army prince andrew bolkónski came into the room with the required
papers kutúzov and the austrian member of the hofkriegsrath were
sitting at the table on which a plan was spread out

ah said kutúzov glancing at bolkónski as if by this exclamation he
was asking the adjutant to wait and he went on with the conversation in
french

all i can say general said he with a pleasant elegance of expression
and intonation that obliged one to listen to each deliberately spoken
word it was evident that kutúzov himself listened with pleasure to his
own voice all i can say general is that if the matter depended on my
personal wishes the will of his majesty the emperor francis would have
been fulfilled long ago i should long ago have joined the archduke and
believe me on my honour that to me personally it would be a pleasure to
hand over the supreme command of the army into the hands of a better
informed and more skillful generalof whom austria has so manyand to
lay down all this heavy responsibility but circumstances are sometimes
too strong for us general

and kutúzov smiled in a way that seemed to say you are quite at
liberty not to believe me and i dont even care whether you do or not
but you have no grounds for telling me so and that is the whole point

the austrian general looked dissatisfied but had no option but to reply
in the same tone

on the contrary he said in a querulous and angry tone that
contrasted with his flattering words on the contrary your
excellencys participation in the common action is highly valued by his
majesty but we think the present delay is depriving the splendid
russian troops and their commander of the laurels they have been
accustomed to win in their battles he concluded his evidently
prearranged sentence

kutúzov bowed with the same smile

but that is my conviction and judging by the last letter with which
his highness the archduke ferdinand has honored me i imagine that the
austrian troops under the direction of so skillful a leader as general
mack have by now already gained a decisive victory and no longer need
our aid said kutúzov

the general frowned though there was no definite news of an austrian
defeat there were many circumstances confirming the unfavorable rumors
that were afloat and so kutúzovs suggestion of an austrian victory
sounded much like irony but kutúzov went on blandly smiling with the
same expression which seemed to say that he had a right to suppose so
and in fact the last letter he had received from macks army informed
him of a victory and stated strategically the position of the army was
very favorable

give me that letter said kutúzov turning to prince andrew please
have a look at itand kutúzov with an ironical smile about the corners
of his mouth read to the austrian general the following passage in
german from the archduke ferdinands letter

we have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand men with
which to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross the lech also as
we are masters of ulm we cannot be deprived of the advantage of
commanding both sides of the danube so that should the enemy not cross
the lech we can cross the danube throw ourselves on his line of
communications recross the river lower down and frustrate his
intention should he try to direct his whole force against our faithful
ally we shall therefore confidently await the moment when the imperial
russian army will be fully equipped and shall then in conjunction with
it easily find a way to prepare for the enemy the fate he deserves

kutúzov sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked at the
member of the hofkriegsrath mildly and attentively

but you know the wise maxim your excellency advising one to expect the
worst said the austrian general evidently wishing to have done with
jests and to come to business he involuntarily looked round at the
aidedecamp

excuse me general interrupted kutúzov also turning to prince
andrew look here my dear fellow get from kozlovski all the reports
from our scouts here are two letters from count nostitz and here is one
from his highness the archduke ferdinand and here are these he said
handing him several papers make a neat memorandum in french out of all
this showing all the news we have had of the movements of the austrian
army and then give it to his excellency

prince andrew bowed his head in token of having understood from the
first not only what had been said but also what kutúzov would have liked
to tell him he gathered up the papers and with a bow to both stepped
softly over the carpet and went out into the waiting room

though not much time had passed since prince andrew had left russia he
had changed greatly during that period in the expression of his face
in his movements in his walk scarcely a trace was left of his former
affected languor and indolence he now looked like a man who has time to
think of the impression he makes on others but is occupied with
agreeable and interesting work his face expressed more satisfaction
with himself and those around him his smile and glance were brighter
and more attractive

kutúzov whom he had overtaken in poland had received him very kindly
promised not to forget him distinguished him above the other adjutants
and had taken him to vienna and given him the more serious commissions
from vienna kutúzov wrote to his old comrade prince andrews father

your son bids fair to become an officer distinguished by his industry
firmness and expedition i consider myself fortunate to have such a
subordinate by me

on kutúzovs staff among his fellow officers and in the army generally
prince andrew had as he had had in petersburg society two quite
opposite reputations some a minority acknowledged him to be different
from themselves and from everyone else expected great things of him
listened to him admired and imitated him and with them prince andrew
was natural and pleasant others the majority disliked him and
considered him conceited cold and disagreeable but among these people
prince andrew knew how to take his stand so that they respected and even
feared him

coming out of kutúzovs room into the waiting room with the papers in
his hand prince andrew came up to his comrade the aidedecamp on duty
kozlovski who was sitting at the window with a book

well prince asked kozlovski

i am ordered to write a memorandum explaining why we are not
advancing

and why is it

prince andrew shrugged his shoulders

any news from mack

no

if it were true that he has been beaten news would have come

probably said prince andrew moving toward the outer door

but at that instant a tall austrian general in a greatcoat with the
order of maria theresa on his neck and a black bandage round his head
who had evidently just arrived entered quickly slamming the door
prince andrew stopped short

commander in chief kutúzov said the newly arrived general speaking
quickly with a harsh german accent looking to both sides and advancing
straight toward the inner door

the commanderinchief is engaged said kozlovski going hurriedly up
to the unknown general and blocking his way to the door whom shall i
announce

the unknown general looked disdainfully down at kozlovski who was
rather short as if surprised that anyone should not know him

the commanderinchief is engaged repeated kozlovski calmly

the generals face clouded his lips quivered and trembled he took out
a notebook hurriedly scribbled something in pencil tore out the leaf
gave it to kozlovski stepped quickly to the window and threw himself
into a chair gazing at those in the room as if asking why do they
look at me then he lifted his head stretched his neck as if he
intended to say something but immediately with affected indifference
began to hum to himself producing a queer sound which immediately broke
off the door of the private room opened and kutúzov appeared in the
doorway the general with the bandaged head bent forward as though
running away from some danger and making long quick strides with his
thin legs went up to kutúzov

vous voyez le malheureux mack he uttered in a broken voice

kutúzovs face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectly
immobile for a few moments then wrinkles ran over his face like a wave
and his forehead became smooth again he bowed his head respectfully
closed his eyes silently let mack enter his room before him and closed
the door himself behind him

the report which had been circulated that the austrians had been beaten
and that the whole army had surrendered at ulm proved to be correct
within half an hour adjutants had been sent in various directions with
orders which showed that the russian troops who had hitherto been
inactive would also soon have to meet the enemy

prince andrew was one of those rare staff officers whose chief interest
lay in the general progress of the war when he saw mack and heard the
details of his disaster he understood that half the campaign was lost
understood all the difficulties of the russian armys position and
vividly imagined what awaited it and the part he would have to play
involuntarily he felt a joyful agitation at the thought of the
humiliation of arrogant austria and that in a weeks time he might
perhaps see and take part in the first russian encounter with the
french since suvórov met them he feared that bonapartes genius might
outweigh all the courage of the russian troops and at the same time
could not admit the idea of his hero being disgraced

excited and irritated by these thoughts prince andrew went toward his
room to write to his father to whom he wrote every day in the corridor
he met nesvitski with whom he shared a room and the wag zherkov they
were as usual laughing

why are you so glum asked nesvitski noticing prince andrews pale
face and glittering eyes

theres nothing to be gay about answered bolkónski

just as prince andrew met nesvitski and zherkov there came toward them
from the other end of the corridor strauch an austrian general who on
kutúzovs staff in charge of the provisioning of the russian army and
the member of the hofkriegsrath who had arrived the previous evening
there was room enough in the wide corridor for the generals to pass the
three officers quite easily but zherkov pushing nesvitski aside with
his arm said in a breathless voice

theyre coming theyre coming stand aside make way please
make way

the generals were passing by looking as if they wished to avoid
embarrassing attentions on the face of the wag zherkov there suddenly
appeared a stupid smile of glee which he seemed unable to suppress

your excellency said he in german stepping forward and addressing
the austrian general i have the honor to congratulate you

he bowed his head and scraped first with one foot and then with the
other awkwardly like a child at a dancing lesson

the member of the hofkriegsrath looked at him severely but seeing the
seriousness of his stupid smile could not but give him a moments
attention he screwed up his eyes showing that he was listening

i have the honor to congratulate you general mack has arrived quite
well only a little bruised just here he added pointing with a
beaming smile to his head

the general frowned turned away and went on

gott wie naiv  said he angrily after he had gone a few steps

 good god what simplicity

nesvitski with a laugh threw his arms round prince andrew but
bolkónski turning still paler pushed him away with an angry look and
turned to zherkov the nervous irritation aroused by the appearance of
mack the news of his defeat and the thought of what lay before the
russian army found vent in anger at zherkovs untimely jest

if you sir choose to make a buffoon of yourself he said sharply
with a slight trembling of the lower jaw i cant prevent your doing
so but i warn you that if you dare to play the fool in my presence i
will teach you to behave yourself

nesvitski and zherkov were so surprised by this outburst that they gazed
at bolkónski silently with wideopen eyes

whats the matter i only congratulated them said zherkov

i am not jesting with you please be silent cried bolkónski and
taking nesvitskis arm he left zherkov who did not know what to say

come whats the matter old fellow said nesvitski trying to soothe
him

whats the matter exclaimed prince andrew standing still in his
excitement dont you understand that either we are officers serving
our tsar and our country rejoicing in the successes and grieving at the
misfortunes of our common cause or we are merely lackeys who care
nothing for their masters business quarante mille hommes massacres et
larmee de nos allies detruite et vous trouvez la le mot pour rire
he said as if strengthening his views by this french sentence cest
bien pour un garcon de rien comme cet individu dont vous avez fait un
ami mais pas pour vous pas pour vous  only a hobbledehoy could
amuse himself in this way he added in russianbut pronouncing the word
with a french accenthaving noticed that zherkov could still hear him

 forty thousand men massacred and the army of our allies destroyed
and you find that a cause for jesting

  it is all very well for that goodfornothing fellow of whom you
have made a friend but not for you not for you

he waited a moment to see whether the cornet would answer but he turned
and went out of the corridor





chapter iv

the pávlograd hussars were stationed two miles from braunau the
squadron in which nicholas rostóv served as a cadet was quartered in the
german village of salzeneck the best quarters in the village were
assigned to cavalrycaptain denisov the squadron commander known
throughout the whole cavalry division as vaska denisov cadet rostóv
ever since he had overtaken the regiment in poland had lived with the
squadron commander

on october  the day when all was astir at headquarters over the news
of macks defeat the camp life of the officers of this squadron was
proceeding as usual denisov who had been losing at cards all night
had not yet come home when rostóv rode back early in the morning from a
foraging expedition rostóv in his cadet uniform with a jerk to his
horse rode up to the porch swung his leg over the saddle with a supple
youthful movement stood for a moment in the stirrup as if loathe to
part from his horse and at last sprang down and called to his orderly

ah bondarenko dear friend said he to the hussar who rushed up
headlong to the horse walk him up and down my dear fellow he
continued with that gay brotherly cordiality which goodhearted young
people show to everyone when they are happy

yes your excellency answered the ukrainian gaily tossing his head

mind walk him up and down well

another hussar also rushed toward the horse but bondarenko had already
thrown the reins of the snaffle bridle over the horses head it was
evident that the cadet was liberal with his tips and that it paid to
serve him rostóv patted the horses neck and then his flank and
lingered for a moment

splendid what a horse he will be he thought with a smile and
holding up his saber his spurs jingling he ran up the steps of the
porch his landlord who in a waistcoat and a pointed cap pitchfork in
hand was clearing manure from the cowhouse looked out and his face
immediately brightened on seeing rostóv schon gut morgen schon gut
morgen  he said winking with a merry smile evidently pleased to
greet the young man

 a very good morning a very good morning

schon fleissig  said rostóv with the same gay brotherly smile which
did not leave his eager face hoch oestreicher hoch russen kaiser
alexander hoch  said he quoting words often repeated by the
german landlord

 busy already

  hurrah for the austrians hurrah for the russians hurrah for
emperor alexander

the german laughed came out of the cowshed pulled off his cap and
waving it above his head cried

und die ganze welt hoch

 and hurrah for the whole world

rostóv waved his cap above his head like the german and cried laughing
und vivat die ganze welt though neither the german cleaning his
cowshed nor rostóv back with his platoon from foraging for hay had any
reason for rejoicing they looked at each other with joyful delight and
brotherly love wagged their heads in token of their mutual affection
and parted smiling the german returning to his cowshed and rostóv going
to the cottage he occupied with denisov

what about your master he asked lavrushka denisovs orderly whom
all the regiment knew for a rogue

hasnt been in since the evening must have been losing answered
lavrushka i know by now if he wins he comes back early to brag about
it but if he stays out till morning it means hes lost and will come
back in a rage will you have coffee

yes bring some

ten minutes later lavrushka brought the coffee hes coming said he
now for trouble rostóv looked out of the window and saw denisov
coming home denisov was a small man with a red face sparkling black
eyes and black tousled mustache and hair he wore an unfastened cloak
wide breeches hanging down in creases and a crumpled shako on the back
of his head he came up to the porch gloomily hanging his head

lavwuska he shouted loudly and angrily take it off blockhead

well i am taking it off replied lavrushkas voice

ah youre up already said denisov entering the room

long ago answered rostóv i have already been for the hay and have
seen fraulein mathilde

weally and ive been losing bwother i lost yesterday like a damned
fool cried denisov not pronouncing his rs such ill luck such ill
luck as soon as you left it began and went on hullo there tea

puckering up his face though smiling and showing his short strong
teeth he began with stubby fingers of both hands to ruffle up his thick
tangled black hair

and what devil made me go to that wat an officer nicknamed the
rat he said rubbing his forehead and whole face with both hands
just fancy he didnt let me win a single cahd not one cahd

he took the lighted pipe that was offered to him gripped it in his
fist and tapped it on the floor making the sparks fly while he
continued to shout

he lets one win the singles and collahs it as soon as one doubles it
gives the singles and snatches the doubles

he scattered the burning tobacco smashed the pipe and threw it away
then he remained silent for a while and all at once looked cheerfully
with his glittering black eyes at rostóv

if at least we had some women here but theres nothing foh one to do
but dwink if we could only get to fighting soon hullo whos there
he said turning to the door as he heard a tread of heavy boots and the
clinking of spurs that came to a stop and a respectful cough

the squadron quartermaster said lavrushka

denisovs face puckered still more

wetched he muttered throwing down a purse with some gold in it
wostov deah fellow just see how much there is left and shove the
purse undah the pillow he said and went out to the quartermaster

rostóv took the money and mechanically arranging the old and new coins
in separate piles began counting them

ah telyanin how dye do they plucked me last night came denisovs
voice from the next room

where at bykovs at the rats i knew it replied a piping voice
and lieutenant telyanin a small officer of the same squadron entered
the room

rostóv thrust the purse under the pillow and shook the damp little hand
which was offered him telyanin for some reason had been transferred
from the guards just before this campaign he behaved very well in the
regiment but was not liked rostóv especially detested him and was
unable to overcome or conceal his groundless antipathy to the man

well young cavalryman how is my rook behaving he asked rook was a
young horse telyanin had sold to rostóv

the lieutenant never looked the man he was speaking to straight in the
face his eyes continually wandered from one object to another

i saw you riding this morning he added

oh hes all right a good horse answered rostóv though the horse
for which he had paid seven hundred rubbles was not worth half that sum
hes begun to go a little lame on the left foreleg he added

the hoofs cracked thats nothing ill teach you what to do and show
you what kind of rivet to use

yes please do said rostóv

ill show you ill show you its not a secret and its a horse
youll thank me for

then ill have it brought round said rostóv wishing to avoid
telyanin and he went out to give the order

in the passage denisov with a pipe was squatting on the threshold
facing the quartermaster who was reporting to him on seeing rostóv
denisov screwed up his face and pointing over his shoulder with his
thumb to the room where telyanin was sitting he frowned and gave a
shudder of disgust

ugh i dont like that fellow he said regardless of the
quartermasters presence

rostóv shrugged his shoulders as much as to say nor do i but whats
one to do and having given his order he returned to telyanin

telyanin was sitting in the same indolent pose in which rostóv had left
him rubbing his small white hands

well there certainly are disgusting people thought rostóv as he
entered

have you told them to bring the horse asked telyanin getting up and
looking carelessly about him

i have

let us go ourselves i only came round to ask denisov about yesterdays
order have you got it denisov

not yet but where are you off to

i want to teach this young man how to shoe a horse said telyanin

they went through the porch and into the stable the lieutenant
explained how to rivet the hoof and went away to his own quarters

when rostóv went back there was a bottle of vodka and a sausage on the
table denisov was sitting there scratching with his pen on a sheet of
paper he looked gloomily in rostóvs face and said i am witing to
her

he leaned his elbows on the table with his pen in his hand and
evidently glad of a chance to say quicker in words what he wanted to
write told rostóv the contents of his letter

you see my fwiend he said we sleep when we dont love we are
childwen of the dust but one falls in love and one is a god one is
pua as on the first day of cweation whos that now send him to the
devil im busy he shouted to lavrushka who went up to him not in the
least abashed

who should it be you yourself told him to come its the quartermaster
for the money

denisov frowned and was about to shout some reply but stopped

wetched business he muttered to himself how much is left in the
puhse he asked turning to rostóv

seven new and three old imperials

oh its wetched well what are you standing there for you scacwow
call the quahtehmasteh he shouted to lavrushka

please denisov let me lend you some i have some you know said
rostóv blushing

dont like bowwowing from my own fellows i dont growled denisov

but if you wont accept money from me like a comrade you will offend
me really i have some rostóv repeated

no i tell you

and denisov went to the bed to get the purse from under the pillow

where have you put it wostov

under the lower pillow

its not there

denisov threw both pillows on the floor the purse was not there

thats a miwacle

wait havent you dropped it said rostóv picking up the pillows one
at a time and shaking them

he pulled off the quilt and shook it the purse was not there

dear me can i have forgotten no i remember thinking that you kept it
under your head like a treasure said rostóv i put it just here
where is it he asked turning to lavrushka

i havent been in the room it must be where you put it

but it isnt

youre always like that you thwow a thing down anywhere and forget it
feel in your pockets

no if i hadnt thought of it being a treasure said rostóv but i
remember putting it there

lavrushka turned all the bedding over looked under the bed and under
the table searched everywhere and stood still in the middle of the
room denisov silently watched lavrushkas movements and when the
latter threw up his arms in surprise saying it was nowhere to be found
denisov glanced at rostóv

wostov youve not been playing schoolboy twicks

rostóv felt denisovs gaze fixed on him raised his eyes and instantly
dropped them again all the blood which had seemed congested somewhere
below his throat rushed to his face and eyes he could not draw breath

and there hasnt been anyone in the room except the lieutenant and
yourselves it must be here somewhere said lavrushka

now then you devils puppet look alive and hunt for it shouted
denisov suddenly turning purple and rushing at the man with a
threatening gesture if the purse isnt found ill flog you ill flog
you all

rostóv his eyes avoiding denisov began buttoning his coat buckled on
his saber and put on his cap

i must have that purse i tell you shouted denisov shaking his
orderly by the shoulders and knocking him against the wall

denisov let him alone i know who has taken it said rostóv going
toward the door without raising his eyes denisov paused thought a
moment and evidently understanding what rostóv hinted at seized his
arm

nonsense he cried and the veins on his forehead and neck stood out
like cords you are mad i tell you i wont allow it the purse is
here ill flay this scoundwel alive and it will be found

i know who has taken it repeated rostóv in an unsteady voice and
went to the door

and i tell you dont you dahe to do it shouted denisov rushing at
the cadet to restrain him

but rostóv pulled away his arm and with as much anger as though denisov
were his worst enemy firmly fixed his eyes directly on his face

do you understand what youre saying he said in a trembling voice
there was no one else in the room except myself so that if it is not
so then

he could not finish and ran out of the room

ah may the devil take you and evewybody were the last words rostóv
heard

rostóv went to telyanins quarters

the master is not in hes gone to headquarters said telyanins
orderly has something happened he added surprised at the cadets
troubled face

no nothing

youve only just missed him said the orderly

the headquarters were situated two miles away from salzeneck and
rostóv without returning home took a horse and rode there there was
an inn in the village which the officers frequented rostóv rode up to
it and saw telyanins horse at the porch

in the second room of the inn the lieutenant was sitting over a dish of
sausages and a bottle of wine

ah youve come here too young man he said smiling and raising his
eyebrows

yes said rostóv as if it cost him a great deal to utter the word and
he sat down at the nearest table

both were silent there were two germans and a russian officer in the
room no one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of knives
and the munching of the lieutenant

when telyanin had finished his lunch he took out of his pocket a double
purse and drawing its rings aside with his small white turnedup
fingers drew out a gold imperial and lifting his eyebrows gave it to
the waiter

please be quick he said

the coin was a new one rostóv rose and went up to telyanin

allow me to look at your purse he said in a low almost inaudible
voice

with shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised telyanin handed him the
purse

yes its a nice purse yes yes he said growing suddenly pale and
added look at it young man

rostóv took the purse in his hand examined it and the money in it and
looked at telyanin the lieutenant was looking about in his usual way
and suddenly seemed to grow very merry

if we get to vienna ill get rid of it there but in these wretched
little towns theres nowhere to spend it said he well let me have
it young man im going

rostóv did not speak

and you are you going to have lunch too they feed you quite decently
here continued telyanin now then let me have it

he stretched out his hand to take hold of the purse rostóv let go of
it telyanin took the purse and began carelessly slipping it into the
pocket of his riding breeches with his eyebrows lifted and his mouth
slightly open as if to say yes yes i am putting my purse in my
pocket and thats quite simple and is no one elses business

well young man he said with a sigh and from under his lifted brows
he glanced into rostóvs eyes

some flash as of an electric spark shot from telyanins eyes to rostóvs
and back and back again and again in an instant

come here said rostóv catching hold of telyanins arm and almost
dragging him to the window that money is denisovs you took it he
whispered just above telyanins ear

what what how dare you what said telyanin

but these words came like a piteous despairing cry and an entreaty for
pardon as soon as rostóv heard them an enormous load of doubt fell
from him he was glad and at the same instant began to pity the
miserable man who stood before him but the task he had begun had to be
completed

heaven only knows what the people here may imagine muttered telyanin
taking up his cap and moving toward a small empty room we must have an
explanation

i know it and shall prove it said rostóv

i

every muscle of telyanins pale terrified face began to quiver his
eyes still shifted from side to side but with a downward look not rising
to rostóvs face and his sobs were audible

count dont ruin a young fellow here is this wretched money
take it he threw it on the table i have an old father and
mother

rostóv took the money avoiding telyanins eyes and went out of the
room without a word but at the door he stopped and then retraced his
steps o god he said with tears in his eyes how could you do it

count said telyanin drawing nearer to him

dont touch me said rostóv drawing back if you need it take the
money and he threw the purse to him and ran out of the inn





chapter v

that same evening there was an animated discussion among the squadrons
officers in denisovs quarters

and i tell you rostóv that you must apologize to the colonel said a
tall grizzlyhaired staff captain with enormous mustaches and many
wrinkles on his large features to rostóv who was crimson with
excitement

the staff captain kirsten had twice been reduced to the ranks for
affairs of honor and had twice regained his commission

i will allow no one to call me a liar cried rostóv he told me i
lied and i told him he lied and there it rests he may keep me on duty
every day or may place me under arrest but no one can make me
apologize because if he as commander of this regiment thinks it
beneath his dignity to give me satisfaction then

you just wait a moment my dear fellow and listen interrupted the
staff captain in his deep bass calmly stroking his long mustache you
tell the colonel in the presence of other officers that an officer has
stolen

im not to blame that the conversation began in the presence of other
officers perhaps i ought not to have spoken before them but i am not a
diplomatist thats why i joined the hussars thinking that here one
would not need finesse and he tells me that i am lyingso let him give
me satisfaction

thats all right no one thinks you a coward but thats not the point
ask denisov whether it is not out of the question for a cadet to demand
satisfaction of his regimental commander

denisov sat gloomily biting his mustache and listening to the
conversation evidently with no wish to take part in it he answered the
staff captains question by a disapproving shake of his head

you speak to the colonel about this nasty business before other
officers continued the staff captain and bogdanich the colonel was
called bogdanich shuts you up

he did not shut me up he said i was telling an untruth

well have it so and you talked a lot of nonsense to him and must
apologize

not on any account exclaimed rostóv

i did not expect this of you said the staff captain seriously and
severely you dont wish to apologize but man its not only to him
but to the whole regimentall of usyoure to blame all round the case
is this you ought to have thought the matter over and taken advice but
no you go and blurt it all straight out before the officers now what
was the colonel to do have the officer tried and disgrace the whole
regiment disgrace the whole regiment because of one scoundrel is that
how you look at it we dont see it like that and bogdanich was a
brick he told you you were saying what was not true its not pleasant
but whats to be done my dear fellow you landed yourself in it and
now when one wants to smooth the thing over some conceit prevents your
apologizing and you wish to make the whole affair public you are
offended at being put on duty a bit but why not apologize to an old and
honorable officer whatever bogdanich may be anyway he is an honorable
and brave old colonel youre quick at taking offense but you dont
mind disgracing the whole regiment the staff captains voice began to
tremble you have been in the regiment next to no time my lad youre
here today and tomorrow youll be appointed adjutant somewhere and can
snap your fingers when it is said there are thieves among the pávlograd
officers but its not all the same to us am i not right denisov
its not the same

denisov remained silent and did not move but occasionally looked with
his glittering black eyes at rostóv

you value your own pride and dont wish to apologize continued the
staff captain but we old fellows who have grown up in and god
willing are going to die in the regiment we prize the honor of the
regiment and bogdanich knows it oh we do prize it old fellow and
all this is not right its not right you may take offense or not but i
always stick to mother truth its not right

and the staff captain rose and turned away from rostóv

thats twue devil take it shouted denisov jumping up now then
wostov now then

rostóv growing red and pale alternately looked first at one officer
and then at the other

no gentlemen no you mustnt think i quite understand youre
wrong to think that of me i for me for the honor of the
regiment id ah well ill show that in action and for me the honor
of the flag well never mind its true im to blame to blame all
round well what else do you want

come thats right count cried the staff captain turning round and
clapping rostóv on the shoulder with his big hand

i tell you shouted denisov hes a fine fellow

thats better count said the staff captain beginning to address
rostóv by his title as if in recognition of his confession go and
apologize your excellency yes go

gentlemen ill do anything no one shall hear a word from me said
rostóv in an imploring voice but i cant apologize by god i cant do
what you will how can i go and apologize like a little boy asking
forgiveness

denisov began to laugh

itll be worse for you bogdanich is vindictive and youll pay for your
obstinacy said kirsten

no on my word its not obstinacy i cant describe the feeling i
cant

well its as you like said the staff captain and what has become
of that scoundrel he asked denisov

he has weported himself sick hes to be stwuck off the list tomowwow
muttered denisov

it is an illness theres no other way of explaining it said the
staff captain

illness or not hed better not cwoss my path id kill him shouted
denisov in a bloodthirsty tone

just then zherkov entered the room

what brings you here cried the officers turning to the newcomer

were to go into action gentlemen mack has surrendered with his whole
army

its not true

ive seen him myself

what saw the real mack with hands and feet

into action into action bring him a bottle for such news but how did
you come here

ive been sent back to the regiment all on account of that devil mack
an austrian general complained of me i congratulated him on macks
arrival whats the matter rostóv you look as if youd just come out
of a hot bath

oh my dear fellow were in such a stew here these last two days

the regimental adjutant came in and confirmed the news brought by
zherkov they were under orders to advance next day

were going into action gentlemen

well thank god weve been sitting here too long





chapter vi

kutúzov fell back toward vienna destroying behind him the bridges over
the rivers inn at braunau and traun near linz on october  the
russian troops were crossing the river enns at midday the russian
baggage train the artillery and columns of troops were defiling
through the town of enns on both sides of the bridge

it was a warm rainy autumnal day the wide expanse that opened out
before the heights on which the russian batteries stood guarding the
bridge was at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain and
then suddenly spread out in the sunlight fardistant objects could be
clearly seen glittering as though freshly varnished down below the
little town could be seen with its white redroofed houses its
cathedral and its bridge on both sides of which streamed jostling
masses of russian troops at the bend of the danube vessels an island
and a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence of
the enns and the danube became visible and the rocky left bank of the
danube covered with pine forests with a mystic background of green
treetops and bluish gorges the turrets of a convent stood out beyond a
wild virgin pine forest and far away on the other side of the enns the
enemys horse patrols could be discerned

among the field guns on the brow of the hill the general in command of
the rearguard stood with a staff officer scanning the country through
his fieldglass a little behind them nesvitski who had been sent to the
rearguard by the commanderinchief was sitting on the trail of a gun
carriage a cossack who accompanied him had handed him a knapsack and a
flask and nesvitski was treating some officers to pies and real
doppelkummel the officers gladly gathered round him some on their
knees some squatting turkish fashion on the wet grass

yes the austrian prince who built that castle was no fool its a fine
place why are you not eating anything gentlemen nesvitski was
saying

thank you very much prince answered one of the officers pleased to
be talking to a staff officer of such importance its a lovely place
we passed close to the park and saw two deer and what a splendid
house

look prince said another who would have dearly liked to take
another pie but felt shy and therefore pretended to be examining the
countrysidesee our infantrymen have already got there look there in
the meadow behind the village three of them are dragging something
theyll ransack that castle he remarked with evident approval

so they will said nesvitski no but what i should like added he
munching a pie in his moistlipped handsome mouth would be to slip in
over there

he pointed with a smile to a turreted nunnery and his eyes narrowed and
gleamed

that would be fine gentlemen

the officers laughed

just to flutter the nuns a bit they say there are italian girls among
them on my word id give five years of my life for it

they must be feeling dull too said one of the bolder officers
laughing

meanwhile the staff officer standing in front pointed out something to
the general who looked through his field glass

yes so it is so it is said the general angrily lowering the field
glass and shrugging his shoulders so it is theyll be fired on at the
crossing and why are they dawdling there

on the opposite side the enemy could be seen by the naked eye and from
their battery a milkwhite cloud arose then came the distant report of
a shot and our troops could be seen hurrying to the crossing

nesvitski rose puffing and went up to the general smiling

would not your excellency like a little refreshment he said

its a bad business said the general without answering him our men
have been wasting time

hadnt i better ride over your excellency asked nesvitski

yes please do answered the general and he repeated the order that
had already once been given in detail and tell the hussars that they
are to cross last and to fire the bridge as i ordered and the
inflammable material on the bridge must be reinspected

very good answered nesvitski

he called the cossack with his horse told him to put away the knapsack
and flask and swung his heavy person easily into the saddle

ill really call in on the nuns he said to the officers who watched
him smilingly and he rode off by the winding path down the hill

now then lets see how far it will carry captain just try said the
general turning to an artillery officer have a little fun to pass the
time

crew to your guns commanded the officer

in a moment the men came running gaily from their campfires and began
loading

one came the command

number one jumped briskly aside the gun rang out with a deafening
metallic roar and a whistling grenade flew above the heads of our
troops below the hill and fell far short of the enemy a little smoke
showing the spot where it burst

the faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound everyone got
up and began watching the movements of our troops below as plainly
visible as if but a stones throw away and the movements of the
approaching enemy farther off at the same instant the sun came fully
out from behind the clouds and the clear sound of the solitary shot and
the brilliance of the bright sunshine merged in a single joyous and
spirited impression





chapter vii

two of the enemys shots had already flown across the bridge where
there was a crush halfway across stood prince nesvitski who had
alighted from his horse and whose big body was jammed against the
railings he looked back laughing to the cossack who stood a few steps
behind him holding two horses by their bridles each time prince
nesvitski tried to move on soldiers and carts pushed him back again and
pressed him against the railings and all he could do was to smile

what a fine fellow you are friend said the cossack to a convoy
soldier with a wagon who was pressing onto the infantrymen who were
crowded together close to his wheels and his horses what a fellow you
cant wait a moment dont you see the general wants to pass

but the convoyman took no notice of the word general and shouted at
the soldiers who were blocking his way hi there boys keep to the
left wait a bit but the soldiers crowded together shoulder to
shoulder their bayonets interlocking moved over the bridge in a dense
mass looking down over the rails prince nesvitski saw the rapid noisy
little waves of the enns which rippling and eddying round the piles of
the bridge chased each other along looking on the bridge he saw equally
uniform living waves of soldiers shoulder straps covered shakos
knapsacks bayonets long muskets and under the shakos faces with
broad cheekbones sunken cheeks and listless tired expressions and
feet that moved through the sticky mud that covered the planks of the
bridge sometimes through the monotonous waves of men like a fleck of
white foam on the waves of the enns an officer in a cloak and with a
type of face different from that of the men squeezed his way along
sometimes like a chip of wood whirling in the river an hussar on foot
an orderly or a townsman was carried through the waves of infantry and
sometimes like a log floating down the river an officers or companys
baggage wagon piled high leather covered and hemmed in on all sides
moved across the bridge

its as if a dam had burst said the cossack hopelessly are there
many more of you to come

a million all but one replied a waggish soldier in a torn coat with
a wink and passed on followed by another an old man

if he he meant the enemy begins popping at the bridge now said
the old soldier dismally to a comrade youll forget to scratch
yourself

that soldier passed on and after him came another sitting on a cart

where the devil have the leg bands been shoved to said an orderly
running behind the cart and fumbling in the back of it

and he also passed on with the wagon then came some merry soldiers who
had evidently been drinking

and then old fellow he gives him one in the teeth with the butt end
of his gun a soldier whose greatcoat was well tucked up said gaily
with a wide swing of his arm

yes the ham was just delicious answered another with a loud laugh
and they too passed on so that nesvitski did not learn who had been
struck on the teeth or what the ham had to do with it

bah how they scurry he just sends a ball and they think theyll all
be killed a sergeant was saying angrily and reproachfully

as it flies past me daddy the ball i mean said a young soldier with
an enormous mouth hardly refraining from laughing i felt like dying
of fright i did pon my word i got that frightened said he as if
bragging of having been frightened

that one also passed then followed a cart unlike any that had gone
before it was a german cart with a pair of horses led by a german and
seemed loaded with a whole houseful of effects a fine brindled cow with
a large udder was attached to the cart behind a woman with an unweaned
baby an old woman and a healthy german girl with bright red cheeks
were sitting on some feather beds evidently these fugitives were
allowed to pass by special permission the eyes of all the soldiers
turned toward the women and while the vehicle was passing at foot pace
all the soldiers remarks related to the two young ones every face bore
almost the same smile expressing unseemly thoughts about the women

just see the german sausage is making tracks too

sell me the missis said another soldier addressing the german who
angry and frightened strode energetically along with downcast eyes

see how smart shes made herself oh the devils

there fedotov you should be quartered on them

i have seen as much before now mate

where are you going asked an infantry officer who was eating an
apple also half smiling as he looked at the handsome girl

the german closed his eyes signifying that he did not understand

take it if you like said the officer giving the girl an apple

the girl smiled and took it nesvitski like the rest of the men on the
bridge did not take his eyes off the women till they had passed when
they had gone by the same stream of soldiers followed with the same
kind of talk and at last all stopped as often happens the horses of a
convoy wagon became restive at the end of the bridge and the whole
crowd had to wait

and why are they stopping theres no proper order said the soldiers
where are you shoving to devil take you cant you wait itll be
worse if he fires the bridge see heres an officer jammed in
toodifferent voices were saying in the crowd as the men looked at one
another and all pressed toward the exit from the bridge

looking down at the waters of the enns under the bridge nesvitski
suddenly heard a sound new to him of something swiftly approaching
something big that splashed into the water

just see where it carries to a soldier near by said sternly looking
round at the sound

encouraging us to get along quicker said another uneasily

the crowd moved on again nesvitski realized that it was a cannon ball

hey cossack my horse he said now then you there get out of the
way make way

with great difficulty he managed to get to his horse and shouting
continually he moved on the soldiers squeezed themselves to make way
for him but again pressed on him so that they jammed his leg and those
nearest him were not to blame for they were themselves pressed still
harder from behind

nesvitski nesvitski you numskull came a hoarse voice from behind
him

nesvitski looked round and saw some fifteen paces away but separated by
the living mass of moving infantry vaska denisov red and shaggy with
his cap on the back of his black head and a cloak hanging jauntily over
his shoulder

tell these devils these fiends to let me pass shouted denisov
evidently in a fit of rage his coalblack eyes with their bloodshot
whites glittering and rolling as he waved his sheathed saber in a small
bare hand as red as his face

ah vaska joyfully replied nesvitski whats up with you

the squadwon cant pass shouted vaska denisov showing his white
teeth fiercely and spurring his black thoroughbred arab which twitched
its ears as the bayonets touched it and snorted spurting white foam
from his bit tramping the planks of the bridge with his hoofs and
apparently ready to jump over the railings had his rider let him what
is this theyre like sheep just like sheep out of the way let us
pass stop there you devil with the cart ill hack you with my
saber he shouted actually drawing his saber from its scabbard and
flourishing it

the soldiers crowded against one another with terrified faces and
denisov joined nesvitski

hows it youre not drunk today said nesvitski when the other had
ridden up to him

they dont even give one time to dwink answered vaska denisov they
keep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo all day if they mean to fight
lets fight but the devil knows what this is

what a dandy you are today said nesvitski looking at denisovs new
cloak and saddlecloth

denisov smiled took out of his sabretache a handkerchief that diffused
a smell of perfume and put it to nesvitskis nose

of course im going into action ive shaved bwushed my teeth and
scented myself

the imposing figure of nesvitski followed by his cossack and the
determination of denisov who flourished his sword and shouted
frantically had such an effect that they managed to squeeze through to
the farther side of the bridge and stopped the infantry beside the
bridge nesvitski found the colonel to whom he had to deliver the order
and having done this he rode back

having cleared the way denisov stopped at the end of the bridge
carelessly holding in his stallion that was neighing and pawing the
ground eager to rejoin its fellows he watched his squadron draw
nearer then the clang of hoofs as of several horses galloping
resounded on the planks of the bridge and the squadron officers in
front and men four abreast spread across the bridge and began to emerge
on his side of it

the infantry who had been stopped crowded near the bridge in the
trampled mud and gazed with that particular feeling of illwill
estrangement and ridicule with which troops of different arms usually
encounter one another at the clean smart hussars who moved past them in
regular order

smart lads only fit for a fair said one

what good are they theyre led about just for show remarked another

dont kick up the dust you infantry jested an hussar whose prancing
horse had splashed mud over some foot soldiers

id like to put you on a two days march with a knapsack your fine
cords would soon get a bit rubbed said an infantryman wiping the mud
off his face with his sleeve perched up there youre more like a bird
than a man

there now zikin they ought to put you on a horse youd look fine
said a corporal chaffing a thin little soldier who bent under the
weight of his knapsack

take a stick between your legs thatll suit you for a horse the
hussar shouted back





chapter viii

the last of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge squeezing
together as they approached it as if passing through a funnel at last
the baggage wagons had all crossed the crush was less and the last
battalion came onto the bridge only denisovs squadron of hussars
remained on the farther side of the bridge facing the enemy who could
be seen from the hill on the opposite bank but was not yet visible from
the bridge for the horizon as seen from the valley through which the
river flowed was formed by the rising ground only half a mile away at
the foot of the hill lay wasteland over which a few groups of our
cossack scouts were moving suddenly on the road at the top of the high
ground artillery and troops in blue uniform were seen these were the
french a group of cossack scouts retired down the hill at a trot all
the officers and men of denisovs squadron though they tried to talk of
other things and to look in other directions thought only of what was
there on the hilltop and kept constantly looking at the patches
appearing on the skyline which they knew to be the enemys troops the
weather had cleared again since noon and the sun was descending brightly
upon the danube and the dark hills around it it was calm and at
intervals the bugle calls and the shouts of the enemy could be heard
from the hill there was no one now between the squadron and the enemy
except a few scattered skirmishers an empty space of some seven hundred
yards was all that separated them the enemy ceased firing and that
stern threatening inaccessible and intangible line which separates
two hostile armies was all the more clearly felt

one step beyond that boundary line which resembles the line dividing
the living from the dead lies uncertainty suffering and death and
what is there who is therethere beyond that field that tree that
roof lit up by the sun no one knows but one wants to know you fear
and yet long to cross that line and know that sooner or later it must
be crossed and you will have to find out what is there just as you will
inevitably have to learn what lies the other side of death but you are
strong healthy cheerful and excited and are surrounded by other such
excitedly animated and healthy men so thinks or at any rate feels
anyone who comes in sight of the enemy and that feeling gives a
particular glamour and glad keenness of impression to everything that
takes place at such moments

on the high ground where the enemy was the smoke of a cannon rose and
a ball flew whistling over the heads of the hussar squadron the
officers who had been standing together rode off to their places the
hussars began carefully aligning their horses silence fell on the whole
squadron all were looking at the enemy in front and at the squadron
commander awaiting the word of command a second and a third cannon
ball flew past evidently they were firing at the hussars but the balls
with rapid rhythmic whistle flew over the heads of the horsemen and fell
somewhere beyond them the hussars did not look round but at the sound
of each shot as at the word of command the whole squadron with its
rows of faces so alike yet so different holding its breath while the
ball flew past rose in the stirrups and sank back again the soldiers
without turning their heads glanced at one another curious to see their
comrades impression every face from denisovs to that of the bugler
showed one common expression of conflict irritation and excitement
around chin and mouth the quartermaster frowned looking at the
soldiers as if threatening to punish them cadet mironov ducked every
time a ball flew past rostóv on the left flank mounted on his rooka
handsome horse despite its game leghad the happy air of a schoolboy
called up before a large audience for an examination in which he feels
sure he will distinguish himself he was glancing at everyone with a
clear bright expression as if asking them to notice how calmly he sat
under fire but despite himself on his face too that same indication of
something new and stern showed round the mouth

whos that curtseying there cadet miwonov thats not wight look at
me cried denisov who unable to keep still on one spot kept turning
his horse in front of the squadron

the black hairy snubnosed face of vaska denisov and his whole short
sturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in which he
held the hilt of his naked saber looked just as it usually did
especially toward evening when he had emptied his second bottle he was
only redder than usual with his shaggy head thrown back like birds when
they drink pressing his spurs mercilessly into the sides of his good
horse bedouin and sitting as though falling backwards in the saddle
he galloped to the other flank of the squadron and shouted in a hoarse
voice to the men to look to their pistols he rode up to kirsten the
staff captain on his broadbacked steady mare came at a walk to meet
him his face with its long mustache was serious as always only his
eyes were brighter than usual

well what about it said he to denisov it wont come to a fight
youll seewe shall retire

the devil only knows what theyre about muttered denisov ah
wostov he cried noticing the cadets bright face youve got it at
last

and he smiled approvingly evidently pleased with the cadet rostóv felt
perfectly happy just then the commander appeared on the bridge denisov
galloped up to him

your excellency let us attack them ill dwive them off

attack indeed said the colonel in a bored voice puckering up his
face as if driving off a troublesome fly and why are you stopping
here dont you see the skirmishers are retreating lead the squadron
back

the squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire without
having lost a single man the second squadron that had been in the front
line followed them across and the last cossacks quitted the farther side
of the river

the two pávlograd squadrons having crossed the bridge retired up the
hill one after the other their colonel karl bogdanich schubert came
up to denisovs squadron and rode at a footpace not far from rostóv
without taking any notice of him although they were now meeting for the
first time since their encounter concerning telyanin rostóv feeling
that he was at the front and in the power of a man toward whom he now
admitted that he had been to blame did not lift his eyes from the
colonels athletic back his nape covered with light hair and his red
neck it seemed to rostóv that bogdanich was only pretending not to
notice him and that his whole aim now was to test the cadets courage
so he drew himself up and looked around him merrily then it seemed to
him that bogdanich rode so near in order to show him his courage next
he thought that his enemy would send the squadron on a desperate attack
just to punish himrostóv then he imagined how after the attack
bogdanich would come up to him as he lay wounded and would magnanimously
extend the hand of reconciliation

the highshouldered figure of zherkov familiar to the pávlograds as he
had but recently left their regiment rode up to the colonel after his
dismissal from headquarters zherkov had not remained in the regiment
saying he was not such a fool as to slave at the front when he could get
more rewards by doing nothing on the staff and had succeeded in
attaching himself as an orderly officer to prince bagration he now came
to his former chief with an order from the commander of the rear guard

colonel he said addressing rostóvs enemy with an air of gloomy
gravity and glancing round at his comrades there is an order to stop
and fire the bridge

an order to who asked the colonel morosely

i dont myself know to who replied the cornet in a serious tone
but the prince told me to go and tell the colonel that the hussars
must return quickly and fire the bridge

zherkov was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the
colonel of hussars with the same order after him the stout nesvitski
came galloping up on a cossack horse that could scarcely carry his
weight

hows this colonel he shouted as he approached i told you to fire
the bridge and now someone has gone and blundered they are all beside
themselves over there and one cant make anything out

the colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to nesvitski

you spoke to me of inflammable material said he but you said
nothing about firing it

but my dear sir said nesvitski as he drew up taking off his cap and
smoothing his hair wet with perspiration with his plump hand wasnt i
telling you to fire the bridge when inflammable material had been put
in position

i am not your dear sir mr staff officer and you did not tell me to
burn the bridge i know the service and it is my habit orders strictly
to obey you said the bridge would be burned but who would it burn i
could not know by the holy spirit

ah thats always the way said nesvitski with a wave of the hand
how did you get here said he turning to zherkov

on the same business but you are damp let me wring you out

you were saying mr staff officer continued the colonel in an
offended tone

colonel interrupted the officer of the suite you must be quick or
the enemy will bring up his guns to use grapeshot

the colonel looked silently at the officer of the suite at the stout
staff officer and at zherkov and he frowned

i will the bridge fire he said in a solemn tone as if to announce
that in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would still
do the right thing

striking his horse with his long muscular legs as if it were to blame
for everything the colonel moved forward and ordered the second
squadron that in which rostóv was serving under denisov to return to
the bridge

there its just as i thought said rostóv to himself he wishes to
test me his heart contracted and the blood rushed to his face let
him see whether i am a coward he thought

again on all the bright faces of the squadron the serious expression
appeared that they had worn when under fire rostóv watched his enemy
the colonel closelyto find in his face confirmation of his own
conjecture but the colonel did not once glance at rostóv and looked as
he always did when at the front solemn and stern then came the word of
command

look sharp look sharp several voices repeated around him

their sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs jingling the
hussars hastily dismounted not knowing what they were to do the men
were crossing themselves rostóv no longer looked at the colonel he had
no time he was afraid of falling behind the hussars so much afraid
that his heart stood still his hand trembled as he gave his horse into
an orderlys charge and he felt the blood rush to his heart with a
thud denisov rode past him leaning back and shouting something rostóv
saw nothing but the hussars running all around him their spurs catching
and their sabers clattering

stretchers shouted someone behind him

rostóv did not think what this call for stretchers meant he ran on
trying only to be ahead of the others but just at the bridge not
looking at the ground he came on some sticky trodden mud stumbled
and fell on his hands the others outstripped him

at boss zides captain he heard the voice of the colonel who having
ridden ahead had pulled up his horse near the bridge with a
triumphant cheerful face

rostóv wiping his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his enemy and
was about to run on thinking that the farther he went to the front the
better but bogdanich without looking at or recognizing rostóv shouted
to him

whos that running on the middle of the bridge to the right come
back cadet he cried angrily and turning to denisov who showing off
his courage had ridden on to the planks of the bridge

why run risks captain you should dismount he said

oh every bullet has its billet answered vaska denisov turning in
his saddle

meanwhile nesvitski zherkov and the officer of the suite were standing
together out of range of the shots watching now the small group of men
with yellow shakos darkgreen jackets braided with cord and blue
riding breeches who were swarming near the bridge and then at what was
approaching in the distance from the opposite sidethe blue uniforms and
groups with horses easily recognizable as artillery

will they burn the bridge or not wholl get there first will they get
there and fire the bridge or will the french get within grapeshot range
and wipe them out these were the questions each man of the troops on
the high ground above the bridge involuntarily asked himself with a
sinking heartwatching the bridge and the hussars in the bright evening
light and the blue tunics advancing from the other side with their
bayonets and guns

ugh the hussars will get it hot said nesvitski they are within
grapeshot range now

he shouldnt have taken so many men said the officer of the suite

true enough answered nesvitski two smart fellows could have done
the job just as well

ah your excellency put in zherkov his eyes fixed on the hussars
but still with that naïve air that made it impossible to know whether he
was speaking in jest or in earnest ah your excellency how you look
at things send two men and who then would give us the vladimir medal
and ribbon but now even if they do get peppered the squadron may be
recommended for honors and he may get a ribbon our bogdanich knows how
things are done

there now said the officer of the suite thats grapeshot

he pointed to the french guns the limbers of which were being detached
and hurriedly removed

on the french side amid the groups with cannon a cloud of smoke
appeared then a second and a third almost simultaneously and at the
moment when the first report was heard a fourth was seen then two
reports one after another and a third

oh oh groaned nesvitski as if in fierce pain seizing the officer of
the suite by the arm look a man has fallen fallen fallen

two i think

if i were tsar i would never go to war said nesvitski turning away

the french guns were hastily reloaded the infantry in their blue
uniforms advanced toward the bridge at a run smoke appeared again but
at irregular intervals and grapeshot cracked and rattled onto the
bridge but this time nesvitski could not see what was happening there
as a dense cloud of smoke arose from it the hussars had succeeded in
setting it on fire and the french batteries were now firing at them no
longer to hinder them but because the guns were trained and there was
someone to fire at

the french had time to fire three rounds of grapeshot before the hussars
got back to their horses two were misdirected and the shot went too
high but the last round fell in the midst of a group of hussars and
knocked three of them over

rostóv absorbed by his relations with bogdanich had paused on the
bridge not knowing what to do there was no one to hew down as he had
always imagined battles to himself nor could he help to fire the
bridge because he had not brought any burning straw with him like the
other soldiers he stood looking about him when suddenly he heard a
rattle on the bridge as if nuts were being spilt and the hussar nearest
to him fell against the rails with a groan rostóv ran up to him with
the others again someone shouted stretchers four men seized the
hussar and began lifting him

oooh for christs sake let me alone cried the wounded man but still
he was lifted and laid on the stretcher

nicholas rostóv turned away and as if searching for something gazed
into the distance at the waters of the danube at the sky and at the
sun how beautiful the sky looked how blue how calm and how deep how
bright and glorious was the setting sun with what soft glitter the
waters of the distant danube shone and fairer still were the faraway
blue mountains beyond the river the nunnery the mysterious gorges and
the pine forests veiled in the mist of their summits there was peace
and happiness i should wish for nothing else nothing if only i
were there thought rostóv in myself alone and in that sunshine there
is so much happiness but here groans suffering fear and this
uncertainty and hurry therethey are shouting again and again are
all running back somewhere and i shall run with them and it death is
here above me and around another instant and i shall never again see
the sun this water that gorge

at that instant the sun began to hide behind the clouds and other
stretchers came into view before rostóv and the fear of death and of
the stretchers and love of the sun and of life all merged into one
feeling of sickening agitation

o lord god thou who art in that heaven save forgive and protect
me rostóv whispered

the hussars ran back to the men who held their horses their voices
sounded louder and calmer the stretchers disappeared from sight

well fwiend so youve smelt powdah shouted vaska denisov just above
his ear

its all over but i am a cowardyes a coward thought rostóv and
sighing deeply he took rook his horse which stood resting one foot
from the orderly and began to mount

was that grapeshot he asked denisov

yes and no mistake cried denisov you worked like wegular bwicks and
its nasty work an attacks pleasant work hacking away at the dogs
but this sort of thing is the very devil with them shooting at you like
a target

and denisov rode up to a group that had stopped near rostóv composed of
the colonel nesvitski zherkov and the officer from the suite

well it seems that no one has noticed thought rostóv and this was
true no one had taken any notice for everyone knew the sensation which
the cadet under fire for the first time had experienced

heres something for you to report said zherkov see if i dont get
promoted to a sublieutenancy

inform the prince that i the bridge fired said the colonel
triumphantly and gaily

and if he asks about the losses

a trifle said the colonel in his bass voice two hussars wounded
and one knocked out he added unable to restrain a happy smile and
pronouncing the phrase knocked out with ringing distinctness





chapter ix

pursued by the french army of a hundred thousand men under the command
of bonaparte encountering a population that was unfriendly to it
losing confidence in its allies suffering from shortness of supplies
and compelled to act under conditions of war unlike anything that had
been foreseen the russian army of thirtyfive thousand men commanded by
kutúzov was hurriedly retreating along the danube stopping where
overtaken by the enemy and fighting rearguard actions only as far as
necessary to enable it to retreat without losing its heavy equipment
there had been actions at lambach amstetten and melk but despite the
courage and enduranceacknowledged even by the enemywith which the
russians fought the only consequence of these actions was a yet more
rapid retreat austrian troops that had escaped capture at ulm and had
joined kutúzov at braunau now separated from the russian army and
kutúzov was left with only his own weak and exhausted forces the
defense of vienna was no longer to be thought of instead of an
offensive the plan of which carefully prepared in accord with the
modern science of strategics had been handed to kutúzov when he was in
vienna by the austrian hofkriegsrath the sole and almost unattainable
aim remaining for him was to effect a junction with the forces that were
advancing from russia without losing his army as mack had done at ulm

on the twentyeighth of october kutúzov with his army crossed to the
left bank of the danube and took up a position for the first time with
the river between himself and the main body of the french on the
thirtieth he attacked mortiers division which was on the left bank
and broke it up in this action for the first time trophies were taken
banners cannon and two enemy generals for the first time after a
fortnights retreat the russian troops had halted and after a fight had
not only held the field but had repulsed the french though the troops
were illclad exhausted and had lost a third of their number in
killed wounded sick and stragglers though a number of sick and
wounded had been abandoned on the other side of the danube with a letter
in which kutúzov entrusted them to the humanity of the enemy and though
the big hospitals and the houses in krems converted into military
hospitals could no longer accommodate all the sick and wounded yet the
stand made at krems and the victory over mortier raised the spirits of
the army considerably throughout the whole army and at headquarters
most joyful though erroneous rumors were rife of the imaginary approach
of columns from russia of some victory gained by the austrians and of
the retreat of the frightened bonaparte

prince andrew during the battle had been in attendance on the austrian
general schmidt who was killed in the action his horse had been
wounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a bullet as a mark
of the commanderinchiefs special favor he was sent with the news of
this victory to the austrian court now no longer at vienna which was
threatened by the french but at brunn despite his apparently delicate
build prince andrew could endure physical fatigue far better than many
very muscular men and on the night of the battle having arrived at
krems excited but not weary with dispatches from dokhturov to kutúzov
he was sent immediately with a special dispatch to brunn to be so sent
meant not only a reward but an important step toward promotion

the night was dark but starry the road showed black in the snow that
had fallen the previous daythe day of the battle reviewing his
impressions of the recent battle picturing pleasantly to himself the
impression his news of a victory would create or recalling the sendoff
given him by the commanderinchief and his fellow officers prince
andrew was galloping along in a post chaise enjoying the feelings of a
man who has at length begun to attain a longdesired happiness as soon
as he closed his eyes his ears seemed filled with the rattle of the
wheels and the sensation of victory then he began to imagine that the
russians were running away and that he himself was killed but he
quickly roused himself with a feeling of joy as if learning afresh that
this was not so but that on the contrary the french had run away he
again recalled all the details of the victory and his own calm courage
during the battle and feeling reassured he dozed off the dark
starry night was followed by a bright cheerful morning the snow was
thawing in the sunshine the horses galloped quickly and on both sides
of the road were forests of different kinds fields and villages

at one of the post stations he overtook a convoy of russian wounded the
russian officer in charge of the transport lolled back in the front
cart shouting and scolding a soldier with coarse abuse in each of the
long german carts six or more pale dirty bandaged men were being
jolted over the stony road some of them were talking he heard russian
words others were eating bread the more severely wounded looked
silently with the languid interest of sick children at the envoy
hurrying past them

prince andrew told his driver to stop and asked a soldier in what
action they had been wounded day before yesterday on the danube
answered the soldier prince andrew took out his purse and gave the
soldier three gold pieces

thats for them all he said to the officer who came up

get well soon lads he continued turning to the soldiers theres
plenty to do still

what news sir asked the officer evidently anxious to start a
conversation

good news go on he shouted to the driver and they galloped on

it was already quite dark when prince andrew rattled over the paved
streets of brunn and found himself surrounded by high buildings the
lights of shops houses and street lamps fine carriages and all that
atmosphere of a large and active town which is always so attractive to a
soldier after camp life despite his rapid journey and sleepless night
prince andrew when he drove up to the palace felt even more vigorous and
alert than he had done the day before only his eyes gleamed feverishly
and his thoughts followed one another with extraordinary clearness and
rapidity he again vividly recalled the details of the battle no longer
dim but definite and in the concise form in which he imagined himself
stating them to the emperor francis he vividly imagined the casual
questions that might be put to him and the answers he would give he
expected to be at once presented to the emperor at the chief entrance
to the palace however an official came running out to meet him and
learning that he was a special messenger led him to another entrance

to the right from the corridor euer hochgeboren there you will find
the adjutant on duty said the official he will conduct you to the
minister of war

the adjutant on duty meeting prince andrew asked him to wait and went
in to the minister of war five minutes later he returned and bowing
with particular courtesy ushered prince andrew before him along a
corridor to the cabinet where the minister of war was at work the
adjutant by his elaborate courtesy appeared to wish to ward off any
attempt at familiarity on the part of the russian messenger

prince andrews joyous feeling was considerably weakened as he
approached the door of the ministers room he felt offended and
without his noticing it the feeling of offense immediately turned into
one of disdain which was quite uncalled for his fertile mind instantly
suggested to him a point of view which gave him a right to despise the
adjutant and the minister away from the smell of powder they probably
think it easy to gain victories he thought his eyes narrowed
disdainfully he entered the room of the minister of war with peculiarly
deliberate steps this feeling of disdain was heightened when he saw the
minister seated at a large table reading some papers and making pencil
notes on them and for the first two or three minutes taking no notice
of his arrival a wax candle stood at each side of the ministers bent
bald head with its gray temples he went on reading to the end without
raising his eyes at the opening of the door and the sound of footsteps

take this and deliver it said he to his adjutant handing him the
papers and still taking no notice of the special messenger

prince andrew felt that either the actions of kutúzovs army interested
the minister of war less than any of the other matters he was concerned
with or he wanted to give the russian special messenger that
impression but that is a matter of perfect indifference to me he
thought the minister drew the remaining papers together arranged them
evenly and then raised his head he had an intellectual and distinctive
head but the instant he turned to prince andrew the firm intelligent
expression on his face changed in a way evidently deliberate and
habitual to him his face took on the stupid artificial smile which
does not even attempt to hide its artificiality of a man who is
continually receiving many petitioners one after another

from general field marshal kutúzov he asked i hope it is good news
there has been an encounter with mortier a victory it was high time

he took the dispatch which was addressed to him and began to read it
with a mournful expression

oh my god my god schmidt he exclaimed in german what a calamity
what a calamity

having glanced through the dispatch he laid it on the table and looked
at prince andrew evidently considering something

ah what a calamity you say the affair was decisive but mortier is not
captured again he pondered i am very glad you have brought good
news though schmidts death is a heavy price to pay for the victory
his majesty will no doubt wish to see you but not today i thank you
you must have a rest be at the levee tomorrow after the parade
however i will let you know

the stupid smile which had left his face while he was speaking
reappeared

au revoir thank you very much his majesty will probably desire to see
you he added bowing his head

when prince andrew left the palace he felt that all the interest and
happiness the victory had afforded him had been now left in the
indifferent hands of the minister of war and the polite adjutant the
whole tenor of his thoughts instantaneously changed the battle seemed
the memory of a remote event long past





chapter x

prince andrew stayed at brunn with bilibin a russian acquaintance of
his in the diplomatic service

ah my dear prince i could not have a more welcome visitor said
bilibin as he came out to meet prince andrew franz put the princes
things in my bedroom said he to the servant who was ushering bolkónski
in so youre a messenger of victory eh splendid and i am sitting
here ill as you see

after washing and dressing prince andrew came into the diplomats
luxurious study and sat down to the dinner prepared for him bilibin
settled down comfortably beside the fire

after his journey and the campaign during which he had been deprived of
all the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements of life prince
andrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxurious surroundings such
as he had been accustomed to from childhood besides it was pleasant
after his reception by the austrians to speak if not in russian for
they were speaking french at least with a russian who would he
supposed share the general russian antipathy to the austrians which was
then particularly strong

bilibin was a man of thirtyfive a bachelor and of the same circle as
prince andrew they had known each other previously in petersburg but
had become more intimate when prince andrew was in vienna with kutúzov
just as prince andrew was a young man who gave promise of rising high in
the military profession so to an even greater extent bilibin gave
promise of rising in his diplomatic career he still a young man but no
longer a young diplomat as he had entered the service at the age of
sixteen had been in paris and copenhagen and now held a rather
important post in vienna both the foreign minister and our ambassador
in vienna knew him and valued him he was not one of those many
diplomats who are esteemed because they have certain negative qualities
avoid doing certain things and speak french he was one of those who
liking work knew how to do it and despite his indolence would
sometimes spend a whole night at his writing table he worked well
whatever the import of his work it was not the question what for but
the question how that interested him what the diplomatic matter
might be he did not care but it gave him great pleasure to prepare a
circular memorandum or report skillfully pointedly and elegantly
bilibins services were valued not only for what he wrote but also for
his skill in dealing and conversing with those in the highest spheres

bilibin liked conversation as he liked work only when it could be made
elegantly witty in society he always awaited an opportunity to say
something striking and took part in a conversation only when that was
possible his conversation was always sprinkled with wittily original
finished phrases of general interest these sayings were prepared in the
inner laboratory of his mind in a portable form as if intentionally so
that insignificant society people might carry them from drawing room to
drawing room and in fact bilibins witticisms were hawked about in
the viennese drawing rooms and often had an influence on matters
considered important

his thin worn sallow face was covered with deep wrinkles which always
looked as clean and well washed as the tips of ones fingers after a
russian bath the movement of these wrinkles formed the principal play
of expression on his face now his forehead would pucker into deep folds
and his eyebrows were lifted then his eyebrows would descend and deep
wrinkles would crease his cheeks his small deepset eyes always
twinkled and looked out straight

well now tell me about your exploits said he

bolkónski very modestly without once mentioning himself described the
engagement and his reception by the minister of war

they received me and my news as one receives a dog in a game of
skittles said he in conclusion

bilibin smiled and the wrinkles on his face disappeared

cependant mon cher he remarked examining his nails from a distance
and puckering the skin above his left eye malgre la haute estime que
je professe pour the orthodox russian army javoue que votre victoire
nest pas des plus victorieuses

 but my dear fellow with all my respect for the orthodox russian
army i must say that your victory was not particularly victorious

he went on talking in this way in french uttering only those words in
russian on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasis

come now you with all your forces fall on the unfortunate mortier and
his one division and even then mortier slips through your fingers
wheres the victory

but seriously said prince andrew we can at any rate say without
boasting that it was a little better than at ulm

why didnt you capture one just one marshal for us

because not everything happens as one expects or with the smoothness of
a parade we had expected as i told you to get at their rear by seven
in the morning but had not reached it by five in the afternoon

and why didnt you do it at seven in the morning you ought to have
been there at seven in the morning returned bilibin with a smile you
ought to have been there at seven in the morning

why did you not succeed in impressing on bonaparte by diplomatic
methods that he had better leave genoa alone retorted prince andrew in
the same tone

i know interrupted bilibin youre thinking its very easy to take
marshals sitting on a sofa by the fire that is true but still why
didnt you capture him so dont be surprised if not only the minister
of war but also his most august majesty the emperor and king francis is
not much delighted by your victory even i a poor secretary of the
russian embassy do not feel any need in token of my joy to give my
franz a thaler or let him go with his liebchen to the prater true
we have no prater here

he looked straight at prince andrew and suddenly unwrinkled his
forehead

it is now my turn to ask you why mon cher said bolkónski i
confess i do not understand perhaps there are diplomatic subtleties
here beyond my feeble intelligence but i cant make it out mack loses
a whole army the archduke ferdinand and the archduke karl give no signs
of life and make blunder after blunder kutúzov alone at last gains a
real victory destroying the spell of the invincibility of the french
and the minister of war does not even care to hear the details

thats just it my dear fellow you see its hurrah for the tsar for
russia for the orthodox greek faith all that is beautiful but what do
we i mean the austrian court care for your victories bring us nice
news of a victory by the archduke karl or ferdinand one archdukes as
good as another as you know and even if it is only over a fire brigade
of bonapartes that will be another story and well fire off some
cannon but this sort of thing seems done on purpose to vex us the
archduke karl does nothing the archduke ferdinand disgraces himself
you abandon vienna give up its defenseas much as to say heaven is
with us but heaven help you and your capital the one general whom we
all loved schmidt you expose to a bullet and then you congratulate us
on the victory admit that more irritating news than yours could not
have been conceived its as if it had been done on purpose on purpose
besides suppose you did gain a brilliant victory if even the archduke
karl gained a victory what effect would that have on the general course
of events its too late now when vienna is occupied by the french
army

what occupied vienna occupied

not only occupied but bonaparte is at schonbrunn and the count our
dear count vrbna goes to him for orders

after the fatigues and impressions of the journey his reception and
especially after having dined bolkónski felt that he could not take in
the full significance of the words he heard

count lichtenfels was here this morning bilibin continued and
showed me a letter in which the parade of the french in vienna was fully
described prince murat et tout le tremblement you see that your
victory is not a matter for great rejoicing and that you cant be
received as a savior

really i dont care about that i dont care at all said prince
andrew beginning to understand that his news of the battle before krems
was really of small importance in view of such events as the fall of
austrias capital how is it vienna was taken what of the bridge and
its celebrated bridgehead and prince auersperg we heard reports that
prince auersperg was defending vienna he said

prince auersperg is on this on our side of the river and is defending
usdoing it very badly i think but still he is defending us but
vienna is on the other side no the bridge has not yet been taken and i
hope it will not be for it is mined and orders have been given to blow
it up otherwise we should long ago have been in the mountains of
bohemia and you and your army would have spent a bad quarter of an hour
between two fires

but still this does not mean that the campaign is over said prince
andrew

well i think it is the bigwigs here think so too but they darent
say so it will be as i said at the beginning of the campaign it wont
be your skirmishing at durrenstein or gunpowder at all that will
decide the matter but those who devised it said bilibin quoting one
of his own mots releasing the wrinkles on his forehead and pausing
the only question is what will come of the meeting between the emperor
alexander and the king of prussia in berlin if prussia joins the
allies austrias hand will be forced and there will be war if not it
is merely a question of settling where the preliminaries of the new
campo formio are to be drawn up

what an extraordinary genius prince andrew suddenly exclaimed
clenching his small hand and striking the table with it and what luck
the man has

buonaparte said bilibin inquiringly puckering up his forehead to
indicate that he was about to say something witty buonaparte he
repeated accentuating the u i think however now that he lays down
laws for austria at schonbrunn il faut lui faire grace de lu  i
shall certainly adopt an innovation and call him simply bonaparte

 we must let him off the u

but joking apart said prince andrew do you really think the
campaign is over

this is what i think austria has been made a fool of and she is not
used to it she will retaliate and she has been fooled in the first
place because her provinces have been pillagedthey say the holy russian
army loots terriblyher army is destroyed her capital taken and all
this for the beaux yeux  of his sardinian majesty and thereforethis
is between ourselvesi instinctively feel that we are being deceived my
instinct tells me of negotiations with france and projects for peace a
secret peace concluded separately

 fine eyes

impossible cried prince andrew that would be too base

if we live we shall see replied bilibin his face again becoming
smooth as a sign that the conversation was at an end

when prince andrew reached the room prepared for him and lay down in a
clean shirt on the feather bed with its warmed and fragrant pillows he
felt that the battle of which he had brought tidings was far far away
from him the alliance with prussia austrias treachery bonapartes
new triumph tomorrows levee and parade and the audience with the
emperor francis occupied his thoughts

he closed his eyes and immediately a sound of cannonading of musketry
and the rattling of carriage wheels seemed to fill his ears and now
again drawn out in a thin line the musketeers were descending the hill
the french were firing and he felt his heart palpitating as he rode
forward beside schmidt with the bullets merrily whistling all around
and he experienced tenfold the joy of living as he had not done since
childhood

he woke up

yes that all happened he said and smiling happily to himself like
a child he fell into a deep youthful slumber





chapter xi

next day he woke late recalling his recent impressions the first
thought that came into his mind was that today he had to be presented to
the emperor francis he remembered the minister of war the polite
austrian adjutant bilibin and last nights conversation having
dressed for his attendance at court in full parade uniform which he had
not worn for a long time he went into bilibins study fresh animated
and handsome with his hand bandaged in the study were four gentlemen
of the diplomatic corps with prince hippolyte kurágin who was a
secretary to the embassy bolkónski was already acquainted bilibin
introduced him to the others

the gentlemen assembled at bilibins were young wealthy gay society
men who here as in vienna formed a special set which bilibin their
leader called les notres  this set consisting almost exclusively of
diplomats evidently had its own interests which had nothing to do with
war or politics but related to high society to certain women and to
the official side of the service these gentlemen received prince andrew
as one of themselves an honor they did not extend to many from
politeness and to start conversation they asked him a few questions
about the army and the battle and then the talk went off into merry
jests and gossip

 ours

but the best of it was said one telling of the misfortune of a
fellow diplomat that the chancellor told him flatly that his
appointment to london was a promotion and that he was so to regard it
can you fancy the figure he cut

but the worst of it gentlemeni am giving kurágin away to youis that
that man suffers and this don juan wicked fellow is taking advantage
of it

prince hippolyte was lolling in a lounge chair with his legs over its
arm he began to laugh

tell me about that he said

oh you don juan you serpent cried several voices

you bolkónski dont know said bilibin turning to prince andrew
that all the atrocities of the french army i nearly said of the
russian army are nothing compared to what this man has been doing among
the women

la femme est la compagne de lhomme  announced prince hippolyte and
began looking through a lorgnette at his elevated legs

 woman is mans companion

bilibin and the rest of ours burst out laughing in hippolytes face
and prince andrew saw that hippolyte of whomhe had to admithe had
almost been jealous on his wifes account was the butt of this set

oh i must give you a treat bilibin whispered to bolkónski kurágin
is exquisite when he discusses politicsyou should see his gravity

he sat down beside hippolyte and wrinkling his forehead began talking to
him about politics prince andrew and the others gathered round these
two

the berlin cabinet cannot express a feeling of alliance began
hippolyte gazing round with importance at the others without
expressing as in its last note you understand besides unless
his majesty the emperor derogates from the principle of our alliance

wait i have not finished he said to prince andrew seizing him by
the arm i believe that intervention will be stronger than
nonintervention and he paused finally one cannot impute the
nonreceipt of our dispatch of november  that is how it will end and
he released bolkónskis arm to indicate that he had now quite finished

demosthenes i know thee by the pebble thou secretest in thy golden
mouth said bilibin and the mop of hair on his head moved with
satisfaction

everybody laughed and hippolyte louder than anyone he was evidently
distressed and breathed painfully but could not restrain the wild
laughter that convulsed his usually impassive features

well now gentlemen said bilibin bolkónski is my guest in this
house and in brunn itself i want to entertain him as far as i can with
all the pleasures of life here if we were in vienna it would be easy
but here in this wretched moravian hole it is more difficult and i
beg you all to help me brunns attractions must be shown him you can
undertake the theater i society and you hippolyte of course the
women

we must let him see amelie shes exquisite said one of ours
kissing his finger tips

in general we must turn this bloodthirsty soldier to more humane
interests said bilibin

i shall scarcely be able to avail myself of your hospitality
gentlemen it is already time for me to go replied prince andrew
looking at his watch

where to

to the emperor

oh oh oh well au revoir bolkónski au revoir prince come back
early to dinner cried several voices well take you in hand

when speaking to the emperor try as far as you can to praise the way
that provisions are supplied and the routes indicated said bilibin
accompanying him to the hall

i should like to speak well of them but as far as i know the facts i
cant replied bolkónski smiling

well talk as much as you can anyway he has a passion for giving
audiences but he does not like talking himself and cant do it as you
will see





chapter xii

at the levee prince andrew stood among the austrian officers as he had
been told to and the emperor francis merely looked fixedly into his
face and just nodded to him with his long head but after it was over
the adjutant he had seen the previous day ceremoniously informed
bolkónski that the emperor desired to give him an audience the emperor
francis received him standing in the middle of the room before the
conversation began prince andrew was struck by the fact that the emperor
seemed confused and blushed as if not knowing what to say

tell me when did the battle begin he asked hurriedly

prince andrew replied then followed other questions just as simple
was kutúzov well when had he left krems and so on the emperor spoke
as if his sole aim were to put a given number of questionsthe answers
to these questions as was only too evident did not interest him

at what oclock did the battle begin asked the emperor

i cannot inform your majesty at what oclock the battle began at the
front but at durrenstein where i was our attack began after five in
the afternoon replied bolkónski growing more animated and expecting
that he would have a chance to give a reliable account which he had
ready in his mind of all he knew and had seen but the emperor smiled
and interrupted him

how many miles

from where to where your majesty

from durrenstein to krems

three and a half miles your majesty

the french have abandoned the left bank

according to the scouts the last of them crossed on rafts during the
night

is there sufficient forage in krems

forage has not been supplied to the extent

the emperor interrupted him

at what oclock was general schmidt killed

at seven oclock i believe

at seven oclock its very sad very sad

the emperor thanked prince andrew and bowed prince andrew withdrew and
was immediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides everywhere he saw
friendly looks and heard friendly words yesterdays adjutant reproached
him for not having stayed at the palace and offered him his own house
the minister of war came up and congratulated him on the maria theresa
order of the third grade which the emperor was conferring on him the
empress chamberlain invited him to see her majesty the archduchess
also wished to see him he did not know whom to answer and for a few
seconds collected his thoughts then the russian ambassador took him by
the shoulder led him to the window and began to talk to him

contrary to bilibins forecast the news he had brought was joyfully
received a thanksgiving service was arranged kutúzov was awarded the
grand cross of maria theresa and the whole army received rewards
bolkónski was invited everywhere and had to spend the whole morning
calling on the principal austrian dignitaries between four and five in
the afternoon having made all his calls he was returning to bilibins
house thinking out a letter to his father about the battle and his visit
to brunn at the door he found a vehicle half full of luggage franz
bilibins man was dragging a portmanteau with some difficulty out of
the front door

before returning to bilibins prince andrew had gone to a bookshop to
provide himself with some books for the campaign and had spent some
time in the shop

what is it he asked

oh your excellency said franz with difficulty rolling the
portmanteau into the vehicle we are to move on still farther the
scoundrel is again at our heels

eh what asked prince andrew

bilibin came out to meet him his usually calm face showed excitement

there now confess that this is delightful said he this affair of
the thabor bridge at vienna they have crossed without striking a
blow

prince andrew could not understand

but where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the town
knows

i come from the archduchess i heard nothing there

and you didnt see that everybody is packing up

i did not what is it all about inquired prince andrew impatiently

whats it all about why the french have crossed the bridge that
auersperg was defending and the bridge was not blown up so murat is
now rushing along the road to brunn and will be here in a day or two

what here but why did they not blow up the bridge if it was mined

that is what i ask you no one not even bonaparte knows why

bolkónski shrugged his shoulders

but if the bridge is crossed it means that the army too is lost it
will be cut off said he

thats just it answered bilibin listen the french entered vienna
as i told you very well next day which was yesterday those
gentlemen messieurs les marechaux  murat lannes and belliard mount
and ride to the bridge observe that all three are gascons
gentlemen says one of them you know the thabor bridge is mined and
doubly mined and that there are menacing fortifications at its head and
an army of fifteen thousand men has been ordered to blow up the bridge
and not let us cross but it will please our sovereign the emperor
napoleon if we take this bridge so let us three go and take it yes
lets say the others and off they go and take the bridge cross it
and now with their whole army are on this side of the danube marching
on us you and your lines of communication

 the marshalls

stop jesting said prince andrew sadly and seriously this news
grieved him and yet he was pleased

as soon as he learned that the russian army was in such a hopeless
situation it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead it
out of this position that here was the toulon that would lift him from
the ranks of obscure officers and offer him the first step to fame
listening to bilibin he was already imagining how on reaching the army
he would give an opinion at the war council which would be the only one
that could save the army and how he alone would be entrusted with the
executing of the plan

stop this jesting he said

i am not jesting bilibin went on nothing is truer or sadder these
gentlemen ride onto the bridge alone and wave white handkerchiefs they
assure the officer on duty that they the marshals are on their way to
negotiate with prince auersperg he lets them enter the têtedepont
they spin him a thousand gasconades saying that the war is over that
the emperor francis is arranging a meeting with bonaparte that they
desire to see prince auersperg and so on the officer sends for
auersperg these gentlemen embrace the officers crack jokes sit on the
cannon and meanwhile a french battalion gets to the bridge unobserved
flings the bags of incendiary material into the water and approaches
the têtedepont at length appears the lieutenant general our dear
prince auersperg von mautern himself dearest foe flower of the
austrian army hero of the turkish wars hostilities are ended we can
shake one anothers hand the emperor napoleon burns with impatience
to make prince auerspergs acquaintance in a word those gentlemen
gascons indeed so bewildered him with fine words and he is so
flattered by his rapidly established intimacy with the french marshals
and so dazzled by the sight of murats mantle and ostrich plumes quil
ny voit que du feu et oublie celui quil devait faire faire sur
lennemi  in spite of the animation of his speech bilibin did not
forget to pause after this mot to give time for its due appreciation
the french battalion rushes to the bridgehead spikes the guns and the
bridge is taken but what is best of all he went on his excitement
subsiding under the delightful interest of his own story is that the
sergeant in charge of the cannon which was to give the signal to fire
the mines and blow up the bridge this sergeant seeing that the french
troops were running onto the bridge was about to fire but lannes
stayed his hand the sergeant who was evidently wiser than his general
goes up to auersperg and says prince you are being deceived here are
the french murat seeing that all is lost if the sergeant is allowed
to speak turns to auersperg with feigned astonishment he is a true
gascon and says i dont recognize the worldfamous austrian
discipline if you allow a subordinate to address you like that it was
a stroke of genius prince auersperg feels his dignity at stake and
orders the sergeant to be arrested come you must own that this affair
of the thabor bridge is delightful it is not exactly stupidity nor
rascality

 bridgehead

  that their fire gets into his eyes and he forgets that he ought to
be firing at the enemy

it may be treachery said prince andrew vividly imagining the gray
overcoats wounds the smoke of gunpowder the sounds of firing and the
glory that awaited him

not that either that puts the court in too bad a light replied
bilibin its not treachery nor rascality nor stupidity it is just as
at ulm it ishe seemed to be trying to find the right expression
cest cest du mack nous sommes mackes it is it is a bit of
mack we are macked he concluded feeling that he had produced a good
epigram a fresh one that would be repeated his hitherto puckered brow
became smooth as a sign of pleasure and with a slight smile he began to
examine his nails

where are you off to he said suddenly to prince andrew who had risen
and was going toward his room

i am going away

where to

to the army

but you meant to stay another two days

but now i am off at once

and prince andrew after giving directions about his departure went to
his room

do you know mon cher said bilibin following him i have been
thinking about you why are you going

and in proof of the conclusiveness of his opinion all the wrinkles
vanished from his face

prince andrew looked inquiringly at him and gave no reply

why are you going i know you think it your duty to gallop back to the
army now that it is in danger i understand that mon cher it is
heroism

not at all said prince andrew

but as you are a philosopher be a consistent one look at the other
side of the question and you will see that your duty on the contrary
is to take care of yourself leave it to those who are no longer fit for
anything else you have not been ordered to return and have not been
dismissed from here therefore you can stay and go with us wherever our
ill luck takes us they say we are going to olmutz and olmutz is a very
decent town you and i will travel comfortably in my caleche

do stop joking bilibin cried bolkónski

i am speaking sincerely as a friend consider where and why are you
going when you might remain here you are faced by one of two things
and the skin over his left temple puckered either you will not reach
your regiment before peace is concluded or you will share defeat and
disgrace with kutúzovs whole army

and bilibin unwrinkled his temple feeling that the dilemma was
insoluble

i cannot argue about it replied prince andrew coldly but he thought
i am going to save the army

my dear fellow you are a hero said bilibin





chapter xiii

that same night having taken leave of the minister of war bolkónski
set off to rejoin the army not knowing where he would find it and
fearing to be captured by the french on the way to krems

in brunn everybody attached to the court was packing up and the heavy
baggage was already being dispatched to olmutz near hetzelsdorf prince
andrew struck the high road along which the russian army was moving with
great haste and in the greatest disorder the road was so obstructed
with carts that it was impossible to get by in a carriage prince andrew
took a horse and a cossack from a cossack commander and hungry and
weary making his way past the baggage wagons rode in search of the
commanderinchief and of his own luggage very sinister reports of the
position of the army reached him as he went along and the appearance of
the troops in their disorderly flight confirmed these rumors

cette armee russe que lor de langleterre a transportee des extremites
de lunivers nous allons lui faire eprouver le meme sortle sort de
larmee dulm  he remembered these words in bonapartes address to
his army at the beginning of the campaign and they awoke in him
astonishment at the genius of his hero a feeling of wounded pride and
a hope of glory and should there be nothing left but to die he
thought well if need be i shall do it no worse than others

 that russian army which has been brought from the ends of the earth
by english gold we shall cause to share the same fatethe fate of the
army at ulm

he looked with disdain at the endless confused mass of detachments
carts guns artillery and again baggage wagons and vehicles of all
kinds overtaking one another and blocking the muddy road three and
sometimes four abreast from all sides behind and before as far as ear
could reach there were the rattle of wheels the creaking of carts and
gun carriages the tramp of horses the crack of whips shouts the
urging of horses and the swearing of soldiers orderlies and officers
all along the sides of the road fallen horses were to be seen some
flayed some not and brokendown carts beside which solitary soldiers
sat waiting for something and again soldiers straggling from their
companies crowds of whom set off to the neighboring villages or
returned from them dragging sheep fowls hay and bulging sacks at
each ascent or descent of the road the crowds were yet denser and the
din of shouting more incessant soldiers floundering kneedeep in mud
pushed the guns and wagons themselves whips cracked hoofs slipped
traces broke and lungs were strained with shouting the officers
directing the march rode backward and forward between the carts their
voices were but feebly heard amid the uproar and one saw by their faces
that they despaired of the possibility of checking this disorder

here is our dear orthodox russian army thought bolkónski recalling
bilibins words

wishing to find out where the commanderinchief was he rode up to a
convoy directly opposite to him came a strange onehorse vehicle
evidently rigged up by soldiers out of any available materials and
looking like something between a cart a cabriolet and a caleche a
soldier was driving and a woman enveloped in shawls sat behind the
apron under the leather hood of the vehicle prince andrew rode up and
was just putting his question to a soldier when his attention was
diverted by the desperate shrieks of the woman in the vehicle an
officer in charge of transport was beating the soldier who was driving
the womans vehicle for trying to get ahead of others and the strokes
of his whip fell on the apron of the equipage the woman screamed
piercingly seeing prince andrew she leaned out from behind the apron
and waving her thin arms from under the woolen shawl cried

mr aidedecamp mr aidedecamp for heavens sake protect me
what will become of us i am the wife of the doctor of the seventh
chasseurs they wont let us pass we are left behind and have lost
our people

ill flatten you into a pancake shouted the angry officer to the
soldier turn back with your slut

mr aidedecamp help me what does it all mean screamed the
doctors wife

kindly let this cart pass dont you see its a woman said prince
andrew riding up to the officer

the officer glanced at him and without replying turned again to the
soldier ill teach you to push on back

let them pass i tell you repeated prince andrew compressing his
lips

and who are you cried the officer turning on him with tipsy rage
who are you are you in command here eh i am commander here not you
go back or ill flatten you into a pancake repeated he this
expression evidently pleased him

that was a nice snub for the little aidedecamp came a voice from
behind

prince andrew saw that the officer was in that state of senseless tipsy
rage when a man does not know what he is saying he saw that his
championship of the doctors wife in her queer trap might expose him to
what he dreaded more than anything in the worldto ridicule but his
instinct urged him on before the officer finished his sentence prince
andrew his face distorted with fury rode up to him and raised his
riding whip

kindly letthempass

the officer flourished his arm and hastily rode away

its all the fault of these fellows on the staff that theres this
disorder he muttered do as you like

prince andrew without lifting his eyes rode hastily away from the
doctors wife who was calling him her deliverer and recalling with a
sense of disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene he
galloped on to the village where he was told that the commanderinchief
was

on reaching the village he dismounted and went to the nearest house
intending to rest if but for a moment eat something and try to sort
out the stinging and tormenting thoughts that confused his mind this
is a mob of scoundrels and not an army he was thinking as he went up
to the window of the first house when a familiar voice called him by
name

he turned round nesvitskis handsome face looked out of the little
window nesvitski moving his moist lips as he chewed something and
flourishing his arm called him to enter

bolkónski bolkónski dont you hear eh come quick he shouted

entering the house prince andrew saw nesvitski and another adjutant
having something to eat they hastily turned round to him asking if he
had any news on their familiar faces he read agitation and alarm this
was particularly noticeable on nesvitskis usually laughing countenance

where is the commanderinchief asked bolkónski

here in that house answered the adjutant

well is it true that its peace and capitulation asked nesvitski

i was going to ask you i know nothing except that it was all i could
do to get here

and we my dear boy its terrible i was wrong to laugh at mack were
getting it still worse said nesvitski but sit down and have
something to eat

you wont be able to find either your baggage or anything else now
prince and god only knows where your man peter is said the other
adjutant

where are headquarters

we are to spend the night in znaim

well i have got all i need into packs for two horses said nesvitski
theyve made up splendid packs for mefit to cross the bohemian
mountains with its a bad lookout old fellow but whats the matter
with you you must be ill to shiver like that he added noticing that
prince andrew winced as at an electric shock

its nothing replied prince andrew

he had just remembered his recent encounter with the doctors wife and
the convoy officer

what is the commanderinchief doing here he asked

i cant make out at all said nesvitski

well all i can make out is that everything is abominable abominable
quite abominable said prince andrew and he went off to the house
where the commanderinchief was

passing by kutúzovs carriage and the exhausted saddle horses of his
suite with their cossacks who were talking loudly together prince
andrew entered the passage kutúzov himself he was told was in the
house with prince bagration and weyrother weyrother was the austrian
general who had succeeded schmidt in the passage little kozlovski was
squatting on his heels in front of a clerk the clerk with cuffs turned
up was hastily writing at a tub turned bottom upwards kozlovskis face
looked wornhe too had evidently not slept all night he glanced at
prince andrew and did not even nod to him

second line have you written it he continued dictating to the
clerk the kiev grenadiers podolian

one cant write so fast your honor said the clerk glancing angrily
and disrespectfully at kozlovski

through the door came the sounds of kutúzovs voice excited and
dissatisfied interrupted by another an unfamiliar voice from the
sound of these voices the inattentive way kozlovski looked at him the
disrespectful manner of the exhausted clerk the fact that the clerk and
kozlovski were squatting on the floor by a tub so near to the commander
in chief and from the noisy laughter of the cossacks holding the horses
near the window prince andrew felt that something important and
disastrous was about to happen

he turned to kozlovski with urgent questions

immediately prince said kozlovski dispositions for bagration

what about capitulation

nothing of the sort orders are issued for a battle

prince andrew moved toward the door from whence voices were heard just
as he was going to open it the sounds ceased the door opened and
kutúzov with his eagle nose and puffy face appeared in the doorway
prince andrew stood right in front of kutúzov but the expression of the
commander in chiefs one sound eye showed him to be so preoccupied with
thoughts and anxieties as to be oblivious of his presence he looked
straight at his adjutants face without recognizing him

well have you finished said he to kozlovski

one moment your excellency

bagration a gaunt middleaged man of medium height with a firm
impassive face of oriental type came out after the commanderinchief

i have the honor to present myself repeated prince andrew rather
loudly handing kutúzov an envelope

ah from vienna very good later later

kutúzov went out into the porch with bagration

well goodby prince said he to bagration my blessing and may
christ be with you in your great endeavor

his face suddenly softened and tears came into his eyes with his left
hand he drew bagration toward him and with his right on which he wore
a ring he made the sign of the cross over him with a gesture evidently
habitual offering his puffy cheek but bagration kissed him on the neck
instead

christ be with you kutúzov repeated and went toward his carriage
get in with me said he to bolkónski

your excellency i should like to be of use here allow me to remain
with prince bagrations detachment

get in said kutúzov and noticing that bolkónski still delayed he
added i need good officers myself need them myself

they got into the carriage and drove for a few minutes in silence

there is still much much before us he said as if with an old mans
penetration he understood all that was passing in bolkónskis mind if
a tenth part of his detachment returns i shall thank god he added as
if speaking to himself

prince andrew glanced at kutúzovs face only a foot distant from him and
involuntarily noticed the carefully washed seams of the scar near his
temple where an ismail bullet had pierced his skull and the empty eye
socket yes he has a right to speak so calmly of those mens death
thought bolkónski

that is why i beg to be sent to that detachment he said

kutúzov did not reply he seemed to have forgotten what he had been
saying and sat plunged in thought five minutes later gently swaying
on the soft springs of the carriage he turned to prince andrew there
was not a trace of agitation on his face with delicate irony he
questioned prince andrew about the details of his interview with the
emperor about the remarks he had heard at court concerning the krems
affair and about some ladies they both knew





chapter xiv

on november  kutúzov had received through a spy news that the army he
commanded was in an almost hopeless position the spy reported that the
french after crossing the bridge at vienna were advancing in immense
force upon kutúzovs line of communication with the troops that were
arriving from russia if kutúzov decided to remain at krems napoleons
army of one hundred and fifty thousand men would cut him off completely
and surround his exhausted army of forty thousand and he would find
himself in the position of mack at ulm if kutúzov decided to abandon
the road connecting him with the troops arriving from russia he would
have to march with no road into unknown parts of the bohemian mountains
defending himself against superior forces of the enemy and abandoning
all hope of a junction with buxhowden if kutúzov decided to retreat
along the road from krems to olmutz to unite with the troops arriving
from russia he risked being forestalled on that road by the french who
had crossed the vienna bridge and encumbered by his baggage and
transport having to accept battle on the march against an enemy three
times as strong who would hem him in from two sides

kutúzov chose this latter course

the french the spy reported having crossed the vienna bridge were
advancing by forced marches toward znaim which lay sixtysix miles off
on the line of kutúzovs retreat if he reached znaim before the french
there would be great hope of saving the army to let the french
forestall him at znaim meant the exposure of his whole army to a
disgrace such as that of ulm or to utter destruction but to forestall
the french with his whole army was impossible the road for the french
from vienna to znaim was shorter and better than the road for the
russians from krems to znaim

the night he received the news kutúzov sent bagrations vanguard four
thousand strong to the right across the hills from the kremsznaim to
the viennaznaim road bagration was to make this march without resting
and to halt facing vienna with znaim to his rear and if he succeeded in
forestalling the french he was to delay them as long as possible
kutúzov himself with all his transport took the road to znaim

marching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills with his
hungry illshod soldiers and losing a third of his men as stragglers
by the way bagration came out on the viennaznaim road at hollabrunn a
few hours ahead of the french who were approaching hollabrunn from
vienna kutúzov with his transport had still to march for some days
before he could reach znaim hence bagration with his four thousand
hungry exhausted men would have to detain for days the whole enemy army
that came upon him at hollabrunn which was clearly impossible but a
freak of fate made the impossible possible the success of the trick
that had placed the vienna bridge in the hands of the french without a
fight led murat to try to deceive kutúzov in a similar way meeting
bagrations weak detachment on the znaim road he supposed it to be
kutúzovs whole army to be able to crush it absolutely he awaited the
arrival of the rest of the troops who were on their way from vienna and
with this object offered a three days truce on condition that both
armies should remain in position without moving murat declared that
negotiations for peace were already proceeding and that he therefore
offered this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed count nostitz the
austrian general occupying the advanced posts believed murats emissary
and retired leaving bagrations division exposed another emissary rode
to the russian line to announce the peace negotiations and to offer the
russian army the three days truce bagration replied that he was not
authorized either to accept or refuse a truce and sent his adjutant to
kutúzov to report the offer he had received

a truce was kutúzovs sole chance of gaining time giving bagrations
exhausted troops some rest and letting the transport and heavy convoys
whose movements were concealed from the french advance if but one
stage nearer znaim the offer of a truce gave the only and a quite
unexpected chance of saving the army on receiving the news he
immediately dispatched adjutant general wintzingerode who was in
attendance on him to the enemy camp wintzingerode was not merely to
agree to the truce but also to offer terms of capitulation and
meanwhile kutúzov sent his adjutants back to hasten to the utmost the
movements of the baggage trains of the entire army along the kremsznaim
road bagrations exhausted and hungry detachment which alone covered
this movement of the transport and of the whole army had to remain
stationary in face of an enemy eight times as strong as itself

kutúzovs expectations that the proposals of capitulation which were in
no way binding might give time for part of the transport to pass and
also that murats mistake would very soon be discovered proved correct
as soon as bonaparte who was at schonbrunn sixteen miles from
hollabrunn received murats dispatch with the proposal of a truce and a
capitulation he detected a ruse and wrote the following letter to
murat

schonbrunn th brumaire

at eight oclock in the morning

to prince murat

i cannot find words to express to you my displeasure you command only
my advance guard and have no right to arrange an armistice without my
order you are causing me to lose the fruits of a campaign break the
armistice immediately and march on the enemy inform him that the
general who signed that capitulation had no right to do so and that no
one but the emperor of russia has that right

if however the emperor of russia ratifies that convention i will
ratify it but it is only a trick march on destroy the russian
army you are in a position to seize its baggage and artillery

the russian emperors aidedecamp is an impostor officers are nothing
when they have no powers this one had none the austrians let
themselves be tricked at the crossing of the vienna bridge you are
letting yourself be tricked by an aidedecamp of the emperor

napoleon

bonapartes adjutant rode full gallop with this menacing letter to
murat bonaparte himself not trusting to his generals moved with all
the guards to the field of battle afraid of letting a ready victim
escape and bagrations four thousand men merrily lighted campfires
dried and warmed themselves cooked their porridge for the first time
for three days and not one of them knew or imagined what was in store
for him





chapter xv

between three and four oclock in the afternoon prince andrew who had
persisted in his request to kutúzov arrived at grunth and reported
himself to bagration bonapartes adjutant had not yet reached murats
detachment and the battle had not yet begun in bagrations detachment
no one knew anything of the general position of affairs they talked of
peace but did not believe in its possibility others talked of a battle
but also disbelieved in the nearness of an engagement bagration
knowing bolkónski to be a favorite and trusted adjutant received him
with distinction and special marks of favor explaining to him that
there would probably be an engagement that day or the next and giving
him full liberty to remain with him during the battle or to join the
rearguard and have an eye on the order of retreat which is also very
important

however there will hardly be an engagement today said bagration as
if to reassure prince andrew

if he is one of the ordinary little staff dandies sent to earn a medal
he can get his reward just as well in the rearguard but if he wishes to
stay with me let him hell be of use here if hes a brave officer
thought bagration prince andrew without replying asked the princes
permission to ride round the position to see the disposition of the
forces so as to know his bearings should he be sent to execute an
order the officer on duty a handsome elegantly dressed man with a
diamond ring on his forefinger who was fond of speaking french though
he spoke it badly offered to conduct prince andrew

on all sides they saw rainsoaked officers with dejected faces who
seemed to be seeking something and soldiers dragging doors benches
and fencing from the village

there now prince we cant stop those fellows said the staff officer
pointing to the soldiers the officers dont keep them in hand and
there he pointed to a sutlers tent they crowd in and sit this
morning i turned them all out and now look its full again i must go
there prince and scare them a bit it wont take a moment

yes lets go in and i will get myself a roll and some cheese said
prince andrew who had not yet had time to eat anything

why didnt you mention it prince i would have offered you something

they dismounted and entered the tent several officers with flushed and
weary faces were sitting at the table eating and drinking

now what does this mean gentlemen said the staff officer in the
reproachful tone of a man who has repeated the same thing more than
once you know it wont do to leave your posts like this the prince
gave orders that no one should leave his post now you captain and he
turned to a thin dirty little artillery officer who without his boots
he had given them to the canteen keeper to dry in only his stockings
rose when they entered smiling not altogether comfortably

well arent you ashamed of yourself captain tushin he continued
one would think that as an artillery officer you would set a good
example yet here you are without your boots the alarm will be sounded
and youll be in a pretty position without your boots the staff
officer smiled kindly return to your posts gentlemen all of you
all he added in a tone of command

prince andrew smiled involuntarily as he looked at the artillery officer
tushin who silent and smiling shifting from one stockinged foot to the
other glanced inquiringly with his large intelligent kindly eyes from
prince andrew to the staff officer

the soldiers say it feels easier without boots said captain tushin
smiling shyly in his uncomfortable position evidently wishing to adopt
a jocular tone but before he had finished he felt that his jest was
unacceptable and had not come off he grew confused

kindly return to your posts said the staff officer trying to preserve
his gravity

prince andrew glanced again at the artillery officers small figure
there was something peculiar about it quite unsoldierly rather comic
but extremely attractive

the staff officer and prince andrew mounted their horses and rode on

having ridden beyond the village continually meeting and overtaking
soldiers and officers of various regiments they saw on their left some
entrenchments being thrown up the freshly dug clay of which showed up
red several battalions of soldiers in their shirt sleeves despite the
cold wind swarmed in these earthworks like a host of white ants
spadefuls of red clay were continually being thrown up from behind the
bank by unseen hands prince andrew and the officer rode up looked at
the entrenchment and went on again just behind it they came upon some
dozens of soldiers continually replaced by others who ran from the
entrenchment they had to hold their noses and put their horses to a
trot to escape from the poisoned atmosphere of these latrines

voila lagrement des camps monsieur le prince  said the staff
officer

 this is a pleasure one gets in camp prince

they rode up the opposite hill from there the french could already be
seen prince andrew stopped and began examining the position

thats our battery said the staff officer indicating the highest
point its in charge of the queer fellow we saw without his boots you
can see everything from there lets go there prince

thank you very much i will go on alone said prince andrew wishing
to rid himself of this staff officers company please dont trouble
yourself further

the staff officer remained behind and prince andrew rode on alone

the farther forward and nearer the enemy he went the more orderly and
cheerful were the troops the greatest disorder and depression had been
in the baggage train he had passed that morning on the znaim road seven
miles away from the french at grunth also some apprehension and alarm
could be felt but the nearer prince andrew came to the french lines the
more confident was the appearance of our troops the soldiers in their
greatcoats were ranged in lines the sergeants major and company
officers were counting the men poking the last man in each section in
the ribs and telling him to hold his hand up soldiers scattered over
the whole place were dragging logs and brushwood and were building
shelters with merry chatter and laughter around the fires sat others
dressed and undressed drying their shirts and leg bands or mending
boots or overcoats and crowding round the boilers and porridge cookers
in one company dinner was ready and the soldiers were gazing eagerly at
the steaming boiler waiting till the sample which a quartermaster
sergeant was carrying in a wooden bowl to an officer who sat on a log
before his shelter had been tasted

another company a lucky one for not all the companies had vodka
crowded round a pockmarked broadshouldered sergeant major who tilting
a keg filled one after another the canteen lids held out to him the
soldiers lifted the canteen lids to their lips with reverential faces
emptied them rolling the vodka in their mouths and walked away from
the sergeant major with brightened expressions licking their lips and
wiping them on the sleeves of their greatcoats all their faces were as
serene as if all this were happening at home awaiting peaceful
encampment and not within sight of the enemy before an action in which
at least half of them would be left on the field after passing a
chasseur regiment and in the lines of the kiev grenadiersfine fellows
busy with similar peaceful affairsnear the shelter of the regimental
commander higher than and different from the others prince andrew came
out in front of a platoon of grenadiers before whom lay a naked man two
soldiers held him while two others were flourishing their switches and
striking him regularly on his bare back the man shrieked unnaturally a
stout major was pacing up and down the line and regardless of the
screams kept repeating

its a shame for a soldier to steal a soldier must be honest
honorable and brave but if he robs his fellows there is no honor in
him hes a scoundrel go on go on

so the swishing sound of the strokes and the desperate but unnatural
screams continued

go on go on said the major

a young officer with a bewildered and pained expression on his face
stepped away from the man and looked round inquiringly at the adjutant
as he rode by

prince andrew having reached the front line rode along it our front
line and that of the enemy were far apart on the right and left flanks
but in the center where the men with a flag of truce had passed that
morning the lines were so near together that the men could see one
anothers faces and speak to one another besides the soldiers who
formed the picket line on either side there were many curious onlookers
who jesting and laughing stared at their strange foreign enemies

since early morningdespite an injunction not to approach the picket
linethe officers had been unable to keep sightseers away the soldiers
forming the picket line like showmen exhibiting a curiosity no longer
looked at the french but paid attention to the sightseers and grew
weary waiting to be relieved prince andrew halted to have a look at the
french

look look there one soldier was saying to another pointing to a
russian musketeer who had gone up to the picket line with an officer and
was rapidly and excitedly talking to a french grenadier hark to him
jabbering fine isnt it its all the frenchy can do to keep up with
him there now sidorov

wait a bit and listen its fine answered sidorov who was considered
an adept at french

the soldier to whom the laughers referred was dólokhov prince andrew
recognized him and stopped to listen to what he was saying dólokhov had
come from the left flank where their regiment was stationed with his
captain

now then go on go on incited the officer bending forward and
trying not to lose a word of the speech which was incomprehensible to
him more please more whats he saying

dólokhov did not answer the captain he had been drawn into a hot
dispute with the french grenadier they were naturally talking about the
campaign the frenchman confusing the austrians with the russians was
trying to prove that the russians had surrendered and had fled all the
way from ulm while dólokhov maintained that the russians had not
surrendered but had beaten the french

we have orders to drive you off here and we shall drive you off said
dólokhov

only take care you and your cossacks are not all captured said the
french grenadier

the french onlookers and listeners laughed

well make you dance as we did under suvórov  said dólokhov

 on vous fera danser

qu estce quil chante  asked a frenchman

 whats he singing about

its ancient history said another guessing that it referred to a
former war the emperor will teach your suvara as he has taught the
others

bonaparte began dólokhov but the frenchman interrupted him

not bonaparte he is the emperor sacre nom cried he angrily

the devil skin your emperor

and dólokhov swore at him in coarse soldiers russian and shouldering
his musket walked away

let us go ivan lukich he said to the captain

ah thats the way to talk french said the picket soldiers now
sidorov you have a try

sidorov turning to the french winked and began to jabber meaningless
sounds very fast kari mala tafa safi muter kaska he said
trying to give an expressive intonation to his voice

ho ho ho ha ha ha ha ouh ouh came peals of such healthy and
goodhumored laughter from the soldiers that it infected the french
involuntarily so much so that the only thing left to do seemed to be to
unload the muskets explode the ammunition and all return home as
quickly as possible

but the guns remained loaded the loopholes in blockhouses and
entrenchments looked out just as menacingly and the unlimbered cannon
confronted one another as before





chapter xvi

having ridden round the whole line from right flank to left prince
andrew made his way up to the battery from which the staff officer had
told him the whole field could be seen here he dismounted and stopped
beside the farthest of the four unlimbered cannon before the guns an
artillery sentry was pacing up and down he stood at attention when the
officer arrived but at a sign resumed his measured monotonous pacing
behind the guns were their limbers and still farther back picket ropes
and artillerymens bonfires to the left not far from the farthest
cannon was a small newly constructed wattle shed from which came the
sound of officers voices in eager conversation

it was true that a view over nearly the whole russian position and the
greater part of the enemys opened out from this battery just facing
it on the crest of the opposite hill the village of schon grabern
could be seen and in three places to left and right the french troops
amid the smoke of their campfires the greater part of whom were
evidently in the village itself and behind the hill to the left from
that village amid the smoke was something resembling a battery but it
was impossible to see it clearly with the naked eye our right flank was
posted on a rather steep incline which dominated the french position
our infantry were stationed there and at the farthest point the
dragoons in the center where tushins battery stood and from which
prince andrew was surveying the position was the easiest and most
direct descent and ascent to the brook separating us from schon grabern
on the left our troops were close to a copse in which smoked the
bonfires of our infantry who were felling wood the french line was
wider than ours and it was plain that they could easily outflank us on
both sides behind our position was a steep and deep dip making it
difficult for artillery and cavalry to retire prince andrew took out
his notebook and leaning on the cannon sketched a plan of the
position he made some notes on two points intending to mention them to
bagration his idea was first to concentrate all the artillery in the
center and secondly to withdraw the cavalry to the other side of the
dip prince andrew being always near the commander in chief closely
following the mass movements and general orders and constantly studying
historical accounts of battles involuntarily pictured to himself the
course of events in the forthcoming action in broad outline he imagined
only important possibilities if the enemy attacks the right flank he
said to himself the kiev grenadiers and the podolsk chasseurs must
hold their position till reserves from the center come up in that case
the dragoons could successfully make a flank counterattack if they
attack our center we having the center battery on this high ground
shall withdraw the left flank under its cover and retreat to the dip by
echelons so he reasoned all the time he had been beside the gun
he had heard the voices of the officers distinctly but as often happens
had not understood a word of what they were saying suddenly however
he was struck by a voice coming from the shed and its tone was so
sincere that he could not but listen

no friend said a pleasant and as it seemed to prince andrew a
familiar voice what i say is that if it were possible to know what is
beyond death none of us would be afraid of it thats so friend

another a younger voice interrupted him afraid or not you cant
escape it anyhow

all the same one is afraid oh you clever people said a third manly
voice interrupting them both of course you artillery men are very
wise because you can take everything along with youvodka and snacks

and the owner of the manly voice evidently an infantry officer
laughed

yes one is afraid continued the first speaker he of the familiar
voice one is afraid of the unknown thats what it is whatever we may
say about the soul going to the sky we know there is no sky but only
an atmosphere

the manly voice again interrupted the artillery officer

well stand us some of your herb vodka tushin it said

why thought prince andrew thats the captain who stood up in the
sutlers hut without his boots he recognized the agreeable
philosophizing voice with pleasure

some herb vodka certainly said tushin but still to conceive a
future life

he did not finish just then there was a whistle in the air nearer and
nearer faster and louder louder and faster a cannon ball as if it
had not finished saying what was necessary thudded into the ground near
the shed with super human force throwing up a mass of earth the ground
seemed to groan at the terrible impact

and immediately tushin with a short pipe in the corner of his mouth and
his kind intelligent face rather pale rushed out of the shed followed
by the owner of the manly voice a dashing infantry officer who hurried
off to his company buttoning up his coat as he ran





chapter xvii

mounting his horse again prince andrew lingered with the battery
looking at the puff from the gun that had sent the ball his eyes ran
rapidly over the wide space but he only saw that the hitherto
motionless masses of the french now swayed and that there really was a
battery to their left the smoke above it had not yet dispersed two
mounted frenchmen probably adjutants were galloping up the hill a
small but distinctly visible enemy column was moving down the hill
probably to strengthen the front line the smoke of the first shot had
not yet dispersed before another puff appeared followed by a report
the battle had begun prince andrew turned his horse and galloped back
to grunth to find prince bagration he heard the cannonade behind him
growing louder and more frequent evidently our guns had begun to reply
from the bottom of the slope where the parleys had taken place came
the report of musketry

lemarrois had just arrived at a gallop with bonapartes stern letter
and murat humiliated and anxious to expiate his fault had at once
moved his forces to attack the center and outflank both the russian
wings hoping before evening and before the arrival of the emperor to
crush the contemptible detachment that stood before him

it has begun here it is thought prince andrew feeling the blood
rush to his heart but where and how will my toulon present itself

passing between the companies that had been eating porridge and drinking
vodka a quarter of an hour before he saw everywhere the same rapid
movement of soldiers forming ranks and getting their muskets ready and
on all their faces he recognized the same eagerness that filled his
heart it has begun here it is dreadful but enjoyable was what the
face of each soldier and each officer seemed to say

before he had reached the embankments that were being thrown up he saw
in the light of the dull autumn evening mounted men coming toward him
the foremost wearing a cossack cloak and lambskin cap and riding a
white horse was prince bagration prince andrew stopped waiting for
him to come up prince bagration reined in his horse and recognizing
prince andrew nodded to him he still looked ahead while prince andrew
told him what he had seen

the feeling it has begun here it is was seen even on prince
bagrations hard brown face with its halfclosed dull sleepy eyes
prince andrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that impassive face and
wished he could tell what if anything this man was thinking and
feeling at that moment is there anything at all behind that impassive
face prince andrew asked himself as he looked prince bagration bent
his head in sign of agreement with what prince andrew told him and
said very good in a tone that seemed to imply that everything that
took place and was reported to him was exactly what he had foreseen
prince andrew out of breath with his rapid ride spoke quickly prince
bagration uttering his words with an oriental accent spoke
particularly slowly as if to impress the fact that there was no need to
hurry however he put his horse to a trot in the direction of tushins
battery prince andrew followed with the suite behind prince bagration
rode an officer of the suite the princes personal adjutant zherkov
an orderly officer the staff officer on duty riding a fine bobtailed
horse and a civilianan accountant who had asked permission to be
present at the battle out of curiosity the accountant a stout full
faced man looked around him with a naïve smile of satisfaction and
presented a strange appearance among the hussars cossacks and
adjutants in his camlet coat as he jolted on his horse with a convoy
officers saddle

he wants to see a battle said zherkov to bolkónski pointing to the
accountant but he feels a pain in the pit of his stomach already

oh leave off said the accountant with a beaming but rather cunning
smile as if flattered at being made the subject of zherkovs joke and
purposely trying to appear stupider than he really was

it is very strange mon monsieur prince said the staff officer he
remembered that in french there is some peculiar way of addressing a
prince but could not get it quite right

by this time they were all approaching tushins battery and a ball
struck the ground in front of them

whats that that has fallen asked the accountant with a naïve smile

a french pancake answered zherkov

so thats what they hit with asked the accountant how awful

he seemed to swell with satisfaction he had hardly finished speaking
when they again heard an unexpectedly violent whistling which suddenly
ended with a thud into something soft ffflop and a cossack riding
a little to their right and behind the accountant crashed to earth with
his horse zherkov and the staff officer bent over their saddles and
turned their horses away the accountant stopped facing the cossack
and examined him with attentive curiosity the cossack was dead but the
horse still struggled

prince bagration screwed up his eyes looked round and seeing the
cause of the confusion turned away with indifference as if to say is
it worth while noticing trifles he reined in his horse with the care
of a skillful rider and slightly bending over disengaged his saber
which had caught in his cloak it was an oldfashioned saber of a kind
no longer in general use prince andrew remembered the story of suvórov
giving his saber to bagration in italy and the recollection was
particularly pleasant at that moment they had reached the battery at
which prince andrew had been when he examined the battlefield

whose company asked prince bagration of an artilleryman standing by
the ammunition wagon

he asked whose company but he really meant are you frightened
here and the artilleryman understood him

captain tushins your excellency shouted the redhaired freckled
gunner in a merry voice standing to attention

yes yes muttered bagration as if considering something and he rode
past the limbers to the farthest cannon

as he approached a ringing shot issued from it deafening him and his
suite and in the smoke that suddenly surrounded the gun they could see
the gunners who had seized it straining to roll it quickly back to its
former position a huge broadshouldered gunner number one holding a
mop his legs far apart sprang to the wheel while number two with a
trembling hand placed a charge in the cannons mouth the short round
shouldered captain tushin stumbling over the tail of the gun carriage
moved forward and not noticing the general looked out shading his eyes
with his small hand

lift it two lines more and it will be just right cried he in a feeble
voice to which he tried to impart a dashing note illsuited to his weak
figure number two he squeaked fire medvedev

bagration called to him and tushin raising three fingers to his cap
with a bashful and awkward gesture not at all like a military salute but
like a priests benediction approached the general though tushins
guns had been intended to cannonade the valley he was firing incendiary
balls at the village of schon grabern visible just opposite in front of
which large masses of french were advancing

no one had given tushin orders where and at what to fire but after
consulting his sergeant major zakharchenko for whom he had great
respect he had decided that it would be a good thing to set fire to the
village very good said bagration in reply to the officers report
and began deliberately to examine the whole battlefield extended before
him the french had advanced nearest on our right below the height on
which the kiev regiment was stationed in the hollow where the rivulet
flowed the soulstirring rolling and crackling of musketry was heard
and much farther to the right beyond the dragoons the officer of the
suite pointed out to bagration a french column that was outflanking us
to the left the horizon bounded by the adjacent wood prince bagration
ordered two battalions from the center to be sent to reinforce the right
flank the officer of the suite ventured to remark to the prince that if
these battalions went away the guns would remain without support
prince bagration turned to the officer and with his dull eyes looked at
him in silence it seemed to prince andrew that the officers remark was
just and that really no answer could be made to it but at that moment
an adjutant galloped up with a message from the commander of the
regiment in the hollow and news that immense masses of the french were
coming down upon them and that his regiment was in disorder and was
retreating upon the kiev grenadiers prince bagration bowed his head in
sign of assent and approval he rode off at a walk to the right and sent
an adjutant to the dragoons with orders to attack the french but this
adjutant returned half an hour later with the news that the commander of
the dragoons had already retreated beyond the dip in the ground as a
heavy fire had been opened on him and he was losing men uselessly and
so had hastened to throw some sharpshooters into the wood

very good said bagration

as he was leaving the battery firing was heard on the left also and as
it was too far to the left flank for him to have time to go there
himself prince bagration sent zherkov to tell the general in command
the one who had paraded his regiment before kutúzov at braunau that he
must retreat as quickly as possible behind the hollow in the rear as
the right flank would probably not be able to withstand the enemys
attack very long about tushin and the battalion that had been in
support of his battery all was forgotten prince andrew listened
attentively to bagrations colloquies with the commanding officers and
the orders he gave them and to his surprise found that no orders were
really given but that prince bagration tried to make it appear that
everything done by necessity by accident or by the will of subordinate
commanders was done if not by his direct command at least in accord
with his intentions prince andrew noticed however that though what
happened was due to chance and was independent of the commanders will
owing to the tact bagration showed his presence was very valuable
officers who approached him with disturbed countenances became calm
soldiers and officers greeted him gaily grew more cheerful in his
presence and were evidently anxious to display their courage before
him





chapter xviii

prince bagration having reached the highest point of our right flank
began riding downhill to where the roll of musketry was heard but where
on account of the smoke nothing could be seen the nearer they got to
the hollow the less they could see but the more they felt the nearness
of the actual battlefield they began to meet wounded men one with a
bleeding head and no cap was being dragged along by two soldiers who
supported him under the arms there was a gurgle in his throat and he
was spitting blood a bullet had evidently hit him in the throat or
mouth another was walking sturdily by himself but without his musket
groaning aloud and swinging his arm which had just been hurt while
blood from it was streaming over his greatcoat as from a bottle he had
that moment been wounded and his face showed fear rather than suffering
crossing a road they descended a steep incline and saw several men lying
on the ground they also met a crowd of soldiers some of whom were
unwounded the soldiers were ascending the hill breathing heavily and
despite the generals presence were talking loudly and gesticulating in
front of them rows of gray cloaks were already visible through the
smoke and an officer catching sight of bagration rushed shouting after
the crowd of retreating soldiers ordering them back bagration rode up
to the ranks along which shots crackled now here and now there drowning
the sound of voices and the shouts of command the whole air reeked with
smoke the excited faces of the soldiers were blackened with it some
were using their ramrods others putting powder on the touchpans or
taking charges from their pouches while others were firing though who
they were firing at could not be seen for the smoke which there was no
wind to carry away a pleasant humming and whistling of bullets were
often heard what is this thought prince andrew approaching the crowd
of soldiers it cant be an attack for they are not moving it cant
be a squarefor they are not drawn up for that

the commander of the regiment a thin feeblelooking old man with a
pleasant smilehis eyelids drooping more than half over his old eyes
giving him a mild expression rode up to bagration and welcomed him as a
host welcomes an honored guest he reported that his regiment had been
attacked by french cavalry and that though the attack had been
repulsed he had lost more than half his men he said the attack had
been repulsed employing this military term to describe what had
occurred to his regiment but in reality he did not himself know what
had happened during that halfhour to the troops entrusted to him and
could not say with certainty whether the attack had been repulsed or his
regiment had been broken up all he knew was that at the commencement of
the action balls and shells began flying all over his regiment and
hitting men and that afterwards someone had shouted cavalry and our
men had begun firing they were still firing not at the cavalry which
had disappeared but at french infantry who had come into the hollow and
were firing at our men prince bagration bowed his head as a sign that
this was exactly what he had desired and expected turning to his
adjutant he ordered him to bring down the two battalions of the sixth
chasseurs whom they had just passed prince andrew was struck by the
changed expression on prince bagrations face at this moment it
expressed the concentrated and happy resolution you see on the face of a
man who on a hot day takes a final run before plunging into the water
the dull sleepy expression was no longer there nor the affectation of
profound thought the round steady hawks eyes looked before him
eagerly and rather disdainfully not resting on anything although his
movements were still slow and measured

the commander of the regiment turned to prince bagration entreating him
to go back as it was too dangerous to remain where they were please
your excellency for gods sake he kept saying glancing for support
at an officer of the suite who turned away from him there you see
and he drew attention to the bullets whistling singing and hissing
continually around them he spoke in the tone of entreaty and reproach
that a carpenter uses to a gentleman who has picked up an ax we are
used to it but you sir will blister your hands he spoke as if those
bullets could not kill him and his halfclosed eyes gave still more
persuasiveness to his words the staff officer joined in the colonels
appeals but bagration did not reply he only gave an order to cease
firing and reform so as to give room for the two approaching
battalions while he was speaking the curtain of smoke that had
concealed the hollow driven by a rising wind began to move from right
to left as if drawn by an invisible hand and the hill opposite with
the french moving about on it opened out before them all eyes fastened
involuntarily on this french column advancing against them and winding
down over the uneven ground one could already see the soldiers shaggy
caps distinguish the officers from the men and see the standard
flapping against its staff

they march splendidly remarked someone in bagrations suite

the head of the column had already descended into the hollow the clash
would take place on this side of it

the remains of our regiment which had been in action rapidly formed up
and moved to the right from behind it dispersing the laggards came
two battalions of the sixth chasseurs in fine order before they had
reached bagration the weighty tread of the mass of men marching in step
could be heard on their left flank nearest to bagration marched a
company commander a fine roundfaced man with a stupid and happy
expressionthe same man who had rushed out of the wattle shed at that
moment he was clearly thinking of nothing but how dashing a fellow he
would appear as he passed the commander

with the selfsatisfaction of a man on parade he stepped lightly with
his muscular legs as if sailing along stretching himself to his full
height without the smallest effort his ease contrasting with the heavy
tread of the soldiers who were keeping step with him he carried close
to his leg a narrow unsheathed sword small curved and not like a real
weapon and looked now at the superior officers and now back at the men
without losing step his whole powerful body turning flexibly it was as
if all the powers of his soul were concentrated on passing the commander
in the best possible manner and feeling that he was doing it well he
was happy left left left he seemed to repeat to himself at
each alternate step and in time to this with stern but varied faces
the wall of soldiers burdened with knapsacks and muskets marched in
step and each one of these hundreds of soldiers seemed to be repeating
to himself at each alternate step left left left a fat major
skirted a bush puffing and falling out of step a soldier who had
fallen behind his face showing alarm at his defection ran at a trot
panting to catch up with his company a cannon ball cleaving the air
flew over the heads of bagration and his suite and fell into the column
to the measure of left left close up came the company
commanders voice in jaunty tones the soldiers passed in a semicircle
round something where the ball had fallen and an old trooper on the
flank a noncommissioned officer who had stopped beside the dead men
ran to catch up his line and falling into step with a hop looked back
angrily and through the ominous silence and the regular tramp of feet
beating the ground in unison one seemed to hear left left left

well done lads said prince bagration

glad to do our best your exlenlency came a confused shout from the
ranks a morose soldier marching on the left turned his eyes on
bagration as he shouted with an expression that seemed to say we know
that ourselves another without looking round as though fearing to
relax shouted with his mouth wide open and passed on

the order was given to halt and down knapsacks

bagration rode round the ranks that had marched past him and dismounted
he gave the reins to a cossack took off and handed over his felt coat
stretched his legs and set his cap straight the head of the french
column with its officers leading appeared from below the hill

forward with god said bagration in a resolute sonorous voice
turning for a moment to the front line and slightly swinging his arms
he went forward uneasily over the rough field with the awkward gait of a
cavalryman prince andrew felt that an invisible power was leading him
forward and experienced great happiness

the french were already near prince andrew walking beside bagration
could clearly distinguish their bandoliers red epaulets and even their
faces he distinctly saw an old french officer who with gaitered legs
and turnedout toes climbed the hill with difficulty prince bagration
gave no further orders and silently continued to walk on in front of the
ranks suddenly one shot after another rang out from the french smoke
appeared all along their uneven ranks and musket shots sounded several
of our men fell among them the roundfaced officer who had marched so
gaily and complacently but at the moment the first report was heard
bagration looked round and shouted hurrah

hurrahahah rang a longdrawn shout from our ranks and passing
bagration and racing one another they rushed in an irregular but joyous
and eager crowd down the hill at their disordered foe





chapter xix

the attack of the sixth chasseurs secured the retreat of our right
flank in the center tushins forgotten battery which had managed to
set fire to the schon grabern village delayed the french advance the
french were putting out the fire which the wind was spreading and thus
gave us time to retreat the retirement of the center to the other side
of the dip in the ground at the rear was hurried and noisy but the
different companies did not get mixed but our leftwhich consisted of
the azov and podolsk infantry and the pávlograd hussarswas
simultaneously attacked and outflanked by superior french forces under
lannes and was thrown into confusion bagration had sent zherkov to the
general commanding that left flank with orders to retreat immediately

zherkov not removing his hand from his cap turned his horse about and
galloped off but no sooner had he left bagration than his courage
failed him he was seized by panic and could not go where it was
dangerous

having reached the left flank instead of going to the front where the
firing was he began to look for the general and his staff where they
could not possibly be and so did not deliver the order

the command of the left flank belonged by seniority to the commander of
the regiment kutúzov had reviewed at braunau and in which dólokhov was
serving as a private but the command of the extreme left flank had been
assigned to the commander of the pávlograd regiment in which rostóv was
serving and a misunderstanding arose the two commanders were much
exasperated with one another and long after the action had begun on the
right flank and the french were already advancing were engaged in
discussion with the sole object of offending one another but the
regiments both cavalry and infantry were by no means ready for the
impending action from privates to general they were not expecting a
battle and were engaged in peaceful occupations the cavalry feeding the
horses and the infantry collecting wood

he higher iss dan i in rank said the german colonel of the hussars
flushing and addressing an adjutant who had ridden up so let him do
what he vill but i cannot sacrifice my hussars bugler sount ze
retreat

but haste was becoming imperative cannon and musketry mingling
together thundered on the right and in the center while the capotes of
lannes sharpshooters were already seen crossing the milldam and forming
up within twice the range of a musket shot the general in command of
the infantry went toward his horse with jerky steps and having mounted
drew himself up very straight and tall and rode to the pávlograd
commander the commanders met with polite bows but with secret
malevolence in their hearts

once again colonel said the general i cant leave half my men in
the wood i beg of you i beg of you he repeated to occupy the
position and prepare for an attack

i peg of you yourself not to mix in vot is not your business suddenly
replied the irate colonel if you vere in the cavalry

i am not in the cavalry colonel but i am a russian general and if you
are not aware of the fact

quite avare your excellency suddenly shouted the colonel touching
his horse and turning purple in the face vill you be so goot to come
to ze front and see dat zis position iss no goot i dont vish to
destroy my men for your pleasure

you forget yourself colonel i am not considering my own pleasure and
i wont allow it to be said

taking the colonels outburst as a challenge to his courage the general
expanded his chest and rode frowning beside him to the front line as
if their differences would be settled there amongst the bullets they
reached the front several bullets sped over them and they halted in
silence there was nothing fresh to be seen from the line for from
where they had been before it had been evident that it was impossible
for cavalry to act among the bushes and broken ground as well as that
the french were outflanking our left the general and colonel looked
sternly and significantly at one another like two fighting cocks
preparing for battle each vainly trying to detect signs of cowardice in
the other both passed the examination successfully as there was
nothing to be said and neither wished to give occasion for it to be
alleged that he had been the first to leave the range of fire they
would have remained there for a long time testing each others courage
had it not been that just then they heard the rattle of musketry and a
muffled shout almost behind them in the wood the french had attacked
the men collecting wood in the copse it was no longer possible for the
hussars to retreat with the infantry they were cut off from the line of
retreat on the left by the french however inconvenient the position it
was now necessary to attack in order to cut a way through for
themselves

the squadron in which rostóv was serving had scarcely time to mount
before it was halted facing the enemy again as at the enns bridge
there was nothing between the squadron and the enemy and again that
terrible dividing line of uncertainty and fearresembling the line
separating the living from the deadlay between them all were conscious
of this unseen line and the question whether they would cross it or
not and how they would cross it agitated them all

the colonel rode to the front angrily gave some reply to questions put
to him by the officers and like a man desperately insisting on having
his own way gave an order no one said anything definite but the rumor
of an attack spread through the squadron the command to form up rang
out and the sabers whizzed as they were drawn from their scabbards
still no one moved the troops of the left flank infantry and hussars
alike felt that the commander did not himself know what to do and this
irresolution communicated itself to the men

if only they would be quick thought rostóv feeling that at last the
time had come to experience the joy of an attack of which he had so
often heard from his fellow hussars

foward with god lads rang out denisovs voice at a twot
foward

the horses croups began to sway in the front line rook pulled at the
reins and started of his own accord

before him on the right rostóv saw the front lines of his hussars and
still farther ahead a dark line which he could not see distinctly but
took to be the enemy shots could be heard but some way off

faster came the word of command and rostóv felt rooks flanks
drooping as he broke into a gallop

rostóv anticipated his horses movements and became more and more
elated he had noticed a solitary tree ahead of him this tree had been
in the middle of the line that had seemed so terribleand now he had
crossed that line and not only was there nothing terrible but
everything was becoming more and more happy and animated oh how i
will slash at him thought rostóv gripping the hilt of his saber

huraaaah came a roar of voices let anyone come my way now
thought rostóv driving his spurs into rook and letting him go at a full
gallop so that he outstripped the others ahead the enemy was already
visible suddenly something like a birch broom seemed to sweep over the
squadron rostóv raised his saber ready to strike but at that instant
the trooper nikitenko who was galloping ahead shot away from him and
rostóv felt as in a dream that he continued to be carried forward with
unnatural speed but yet stayed on the same spot from behind him
bondarchuk an hussar he knew jolted against him and looked angrily at
him bondarchuks horse swerved and galloped past

how is it i am not moving i have fallen i am killed rostóv asked
and answered at the same instant he was alone in the middle of a field
instead of the moving horses and hussars backs he saw nothing before
him but the motionless earth and the stubble around him there was warm
blood under his arm no i am wounded and the horse is killed rook
tried to rise on his forelegs but fell back pinning his riders leg
blood was flowing from his head he struggled but could not rise rostóv
also tried to rise but fell back his sabretache having become entangled
in the saddle where our men were and where the french he did not
know there was no one near

having disentangled his leg he rose where on which side was now the
line that had so sharply divided the two armies he asked himself and
could not answer can something bad have happened to me he wondered
as he got up and at that moment he felt that something superfluous was
hanging on his benumbed left arm the wrist felt as if it were not his
he examined his hand carefully vainly trying to find blood on it ah
here are people coming he thought joyfully seeing some men running
toward him they will help me in front came a man wearing a strange
shako and a blue cloak swarthy sunburned and with a hooked nose then
came two more and many more running behind one of them said something
strange not in russian in among the hindmost of these men wearing
similar shakos was a russian hussar he was being held by the arms and
his horse was being led behind him

it must be one of ours a prisoner yes can it be that they will take
me too who are these men thought rostóv scarcely believing his eyes
can they be french he looked at the approaching frenchmen and though
but a moment before he had been galloping to get at them and hack them
to pieces their proximity now seemed so awful that he could not believe
his eyes who are they why are they running can they be coming at me
and why to kill me me whom everyone is so fond of he remembered his
mothers love for him and his familys and his friends and the
enemys intention to kill him seemed impossible but perhaps they may
do it for more than ten seconds he stood not moving from the spot or
realizing the situation the foremost frenchman the one with the hooked
nose was already so close that the expression of his face could be
seen and the excited alien face of that man his bayonet hanging down
holding his breath and running so lightly frightened rostóv he seized
his pistol and instead of firing it flung it at the frenchman and ran
with all his might toward the bushes he did not now run with the
feeling of doubt and conflict with which he had trodden the enns bridge
but with the feeling of a hare fleeing from the hounds one single
sentiment that of fear for his young and happy life possessed his
whole being rapidly leaping the furrows he fled across the field with
the impetuosity he used to show at catchplay now and then turning his
goodnatured pale young face to look back a shudder of terror went
through him no better not look he thought but having reached the
bushes he glanced round once more the french had fallen behind and
just as he looked round the first man changed his run to a walk and
turning shouted something loudly to a comrade farther back rostóv
paused no theres some mistake thought he they cant have wanted
to kill me but at the same time his left arm felt as heavy as if a
seventypound weight were tied to it he could run no more the
frenchman also stopped and took aim rostóv closed his eyes and stooped
down one bullet and then another whistled past him he mustered his
last remaining strength took hold of his left hand with his right and
reached the bushes behind these were some russian sharpshooters





chapter xx

the infantry regiments that had been caught unawares in the outskirts of
the wood ran out of it the different companies getting mixed and
retreated as a disorderly crowd one soldier in his fear uttered the
senseless cry cut off that is so terrible in battle and that word
infected the whole crowd with a feeling of panic

surrounded cut off were lost shouted the fugitives

the moment he heard the firing and the cry from behind the general
realized that something dreadful had happened to his regiment and the
thought that he an exemplary officer of many years service who had
never been to blame might be held responsible at headquarters for
negligence or inefficiency so staggered him that forgetting the
recalcitrant cavalry colonel his own dignity as a general and above
all quite forgetting the danger and all regard for selfpreservation he
clutched the crupper of his saddle and spurring his horse galloped to
the regiment under a hail of bullets which fell around but fortunately
missed him his one desire was to know what was happening and at any
cost correct or remedy the mistake if he had made one so that he an
exemplary officer of twentytwo years service who had never been
censured should not be held to blame

having galloped safely through the french he reached a field behind the
copse across which our men regardless of orders were running and
descending the valley that moment of moral hesitation which decides the
fate of battles had arrived would this disorderly crowd of soldiers
attend to the voice of their commander or would they disregarding him
continue their flight despite his desperate shouts that used to seem so
terrible to the soldiers despite his furious purple countenance
distorted out of all likeness to his former self and the flourishing of
his saber the soldiers all continued to run talking firing into the
air and disobeying orders the moral hesitation which decided the fate
of battles was evidently culminating in a panic

the general had a fit of coughing as a result of shouting and of the
powder smoke and stopped in despair everything seemed lost but at that
moment the french who were attacking suddenly and without any apparent
reason ran back and disappeared from the outskirts and russian
sharpshooters showed themselves in the copse it was timokhins company
which alone had maintained its order in the wood and having lain in
ambush in a ditch now attacked the french unexpectedly timokhin armed
only with a sword had rushed at the enemy with such a desperate cry and
such mad drunken determination that taken by surprise the french had
thrown down their muskets and run dólokhov running beside timokhin
killed a frenchman at close quarters and was the first to seize the
surrendering french officer by his collar our fugitives returned the
battalions reformed and the french who had nearly cut our left flank
in half were for the moment repulsed our reserve units were able to
join up and the fight was at an end the regimental commander and major
ekonomov had stopped beside a bridge letting the retreating companies
pass by them when a soldier came up and took hold of the commanders
stirrup almost leaning against him the man was wearing a bluish coat
of broadcloth he had no knapsack or cap his head was bandaged and
over his shoulder a french munition pouch was slung he had an officers
sword in his hand the soldier was pale his blue eyes looked impudently
into the commanders face and his lips were smiling though the
commander was occupied in giving instructions to major ekonomov he
could not help taking notice of the soldier

your excellency here are two trophies said dólokhov pointing to the
french sword and pouch i have taken an officer prisoner i stopped the
company dólokhov breathed heavily from weariness and spoke in abrupt
sentences the whole company can bear witness i beg you will remember
this your excellency

all right all right replied the commander and turned to major
ekonomov

but dólokhov did not go away he untied the handkerchief around his
head pulled it off and showed the blood congealed on his hair

a bayonet wound i remained at the front remember your excellency

tushins battery had been forgotten and only at the very end of the
action did prince bagration still hearing the cannonade in the center
send his orderly staff officer and later prince andrew also to order
the battery to retire as quickly as possible when the supports attached
to tushins battery had been moved away in the middle of the action by
someones order the battery had continued firing and was only not
captured by the french because the enemy could not surmise that anyone
could have the effrontery to continue firing from four quite undefended
guns on the contrary the energetic action of that battery led the
french to suppose that herein the centerthe main russian forces were
concentrated twice they had attempted to attack this point but on each
occasion had been driven back by grapeshot from the four isolated guns
on the hillock

soon after prince bagration had left him tushin had succeeded in
setting fire to schon grabern

look at them scurrying its burning just see the smoke fine grand
look at the smoke the smoke exclaimed the artillerymen brightening
up

all the guns without waiting for orders were being fired in the
direction of the conflagration as if urging each other on the soldiers
cried at each shot fine thats good look at it grand the fire
fanned by the breeze was rapidly spreading the french columns that had
advanced beyond the village went back but as though in revenge for this
failure the enemy placed ten guns to the right of the village and began
firing them at tushins battery

in their childlike glee aroused by the fire and their luck in
successfully cannonading the french our artillerymen only noticed this
battery when two balls and then four more fell among our guns one
knocking over two horses and another tearing off a munitionwagon
drivers leg their spirits once roused were however not diminished
but only changed character the horses were replaced by others from a
reserve gun carriage the wounded were carried away and the four guns
were turned against the tengun battery tushins companion officer had
been killed at the beginning of the engagement and within an hour
seventeen of the forty men of the guns crews had been disabled but the
artillerymen were still as merry and lively as ever twice they noticed
the french appearing below them and then they fired grapeshot at them

little tushin moving feebly and awkwardly kept telling his orderly to
refill my pipe for that one and then scattering sparks from it ran
forward shading his eyes with his small hand to look at the french

smack at em lads he kept saying seizing the guns by the wheels and
working the screws himself

amid the smoke deafened by the incessant reports which always made him
jump tushin not taking his pipe from his mouth ran from gun to gun now
aiming now counting the charges now giving orders about replacing dead
or wounded horses and harnessing fresh ones and shouting in his feeble
voice so high pitched and irresolute his face grew more and more
animated only when a man was killed or wounded did he frown and turn
away from the sight shouting angrily at the men who as is always the
case hesitated about lifting the injured or dead the soldiers for the
most part handsome fellows and as is always the case in an artillery
company a head and shoulders taller and twice as broad as their
officerall looked at their commander like children in an embarrassing
situation and the expression on his face was invariably reflected on
theirs

owing to the terrible uproar and the necessity for concentration and
activity tushin did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense of
fear and the thought that he might be killed or badly wounded never
occurred to him on the contrary he became more and more elated it
seemed to him that it was a very long time ago almost a day since he
had first seen the enemy and fired the first shot and that the corner
of the field he stood on was wellknown and familiar ground though he
thought of everything considered everything and did everything the
best of officers could do in his position he was in a state akin to
feverish delirium or drunkenness

from the deafening sounds of his own guns around him the whistle and
thud of the enemys cannon balls from the flushed and perspiring faces
of the crew bustling round the guns from the sight of the blood of men
and horses from the little puffs of smoke on the enemys side always
followed by a ball flying past and striking the earth a man a gun a
horse from the sight of all these things a fantastic world of his own
had taken possession of his brain and at that moment afforded him
pleasure the enemys guns were in his fancy not guns but pipes from
which occasional puffs were blown by an invisible smoker

there hes puffing again muttered tushin to himself as a small
cloud rose from the hill and was borne in a streak to the left by the
wind

now look out for the ball well throw it back

what do you want your honor asked an artilleryman standing close
by who heard him muttering

nothing only a shell he answered

come along our matvevna he said to himself matvevna  was the
name his fancy gave to the farthest gun of the battery which was large
and of an old pattern the french swarming round their guns seemed to
him like ants in that world the handsome drunkard number one of the
second guns crew was uncle tushin looked at him more often than at
anyone else and took delight in his every movement the sound of
musketry at the foot of the hill now diminishing now increasing
seemed like someones breathing he listened intently to the ebb and
flow of these sounds

 daughter of matthew

ah breathing again breathing he muttered to himself

he imagined himself as an enormously tall powerful man who was throwing
cannon balls at the french with both hands

now then matvevna dear old lady dont let me down he was saying as
he moved from the gun when a strange unfamiliar voice called above his
head captain tushin captain

tushin turned round in dismay it was the staff officer who had turned
him out of the booth at grunth he was shouting in a gasping voice

are you mad you have twice been ordered to retreat and you

why are they down on me thought tushin looking in alarm at his
superior

i dont he muttered holding up two fingers to his cap i

but the staff officer did not finish what he wanted to say a cannon
ball flying close to him caused him to duck and bend over his horse
he paused and just as he was about to say something more another ball
stopped him he turned his horse and galloped off

retire all to retire he shouted from a distance

the soldiers laughed a moment later an adjutant arrived with the same
order

it was prince andrew the first thing he saw on riding up to the space
where tushins guns were stationed was an unharnessed horse with a
broken leg that lay screaming piteously beside the harnessed horses
blood was gushing from its leg as from a spring among the limbers lay
several dead men one ball after another passed over as he approached
and he felt a nervous shudder run down his spine but the mere thought
of being afraid roused him again i cannot be afraid thought he and
dismounted slowly among the guns he delivered the order and did not
leave the battery he decided to have the guns removed from their
positions and withdrawn in his presence together with tushin stepping
across the bodies and under a terrible fire from the french he attended
to the removal of the guns

a staff officer was here a minute ago but skipped off said an
artilleryman to prince andrew not like your honor

prince andrew said nothing to tushin they were both so busy as to seem
not to notice one another when having limbered up the only two cannon
that remained uninjured out of the four they began moving down the hill
one shattered gun and one unicorn were left behind prince andrew rode
up to tushin

well till we meet again he said holding out his hand to tushin

goodbye my dear fellow said tushin dear soul goodbye my dear
fellow and for some unknown reason tears suddenly filled his eyes





chapter xxi

the wind had fallen and black clouds merging with the powder smoke
hung low over the field of battle on the horizon it was growing dark
and the glow of two conflagrations was the more conspicuous the
cannonade was dying down but the rattle of musketry behind and on the
right sounded oftener and nearer as soon as tushin with his guns
continually driving round or coming upon wounded men was out of range
of fire and had descended into the dip he was met by some of the staff
among them the staff officer and zherkov who had been twice sent to
tushins battery but had never reached it interrupting one another
they all gave and transmitted orders as to how to proceed
reprimanding and reproaching him tushin gave no orders and
silentlyfearing to speak because at every word he felt ready to weep
without knowing whyrode behind on his artillery nag though the orders
were to abandon the wounded many of them dragged themselves after
troops and begged for seats on the gun carriages the jaunty infantry
officer who just before the battle had rushed out of tushins wattle
shed was laid with a bullet in his stomach on matvevnas carriage
at the foot of the hill a pale hussar cadet supporting one hand with
the other came up to tushin and asked for a seat

captain for gods sake ive hurt my arm he said timidly for gods
sake i cant walk for gods sake

it was plain that this cadet had already repeatedly asked for a lift and
been refused he asked in a hesitating piteous voice

tell them to give me a seat for gods sake

give him a seat said tushin lay a cloak for him to sit on lad he
said addressing his favorite soldier and where is the wounded
officer

he has been set down he died replied someone

help him up sit down dear fellow sit down spread out the cloak
antonov

the cadet was rostóv with one hand he supported the other he was pale
and his jaw trembled shivering feverishly he was placed on matvevna
the gun from which they had removed the dead officer the cloak they
spread under him was wet with blood which stained his breeches and arm

what are you wounded my lad said tushin approaching the gun on
which rostóv sat

no its a sprain

then what is this blood on the gun carriage inquired tushin

it was the officer your honor stained it answered the artilleryman
wiping away the blood with his coat sleeve as if apologizing for the
state of his gun

it was all that they could do to get the guns up the rise aided by the
infantry and having reached the village of gruntersdorf they halted it
had grown so dark that one could not distinguish the uniforms ten paces
off and the firing had begun to subside suddenly near by on the
right shouting and firing were again heard flashes of shot gleamed in
the darkness this was the last french attack and was met by soldiers
who had sheltered in the village houses they all rushed out of the
village again but tushins guns could not move and the artillerymen
tushin and the cadet exchanged silent glances as they awaited their
fate the firing died down and soldiers talking eagerly streamed out
of a side street

not hurt petrov asked one

weve given it em hot mate they wont make another push now said
another

you couldnt see a thing how they shot at their own fellows nothing
could be seen pitchdark brother isnt there something to drink

the french had been repulsed for the last time and again and again in
the complete darkness tushins guns moved forward surrounded by the
humming infantry as by a frame

in the darkness it seemed as though a gloomy unseen river was flowing
always in one direction humming with whispers and talk and the sound of
hoofs and wheels amid the general rumble the groans and voices of the
wounded were more distinctly heard than any other sound in the darkness
of the night the gloom that enveloped the army was filled with their
groans which seemed to melt into one with the darkness of the night
after a while the moving mass became agitated someone rode past on a
white horse followed by his suite and said something in passing what
did he say where to now halt is it did he thank us came eager
questions from all sides the whole moving mass began pressing closer
together and a report spread that they were ordered to halt evidently
those in front had halted all remained where they were in the middle of
the muddy road

fires were lighted and the talk became more audible captain tushin
having given orders to his company sent a soldier to find a dressing
station or a doctor for the cadet and sat down by a bonfire the
soldiers had kindled on the road rostóv too dragged himself to the
fire from pain cold and damp a feverish shivering shook his whole
body drowsiness was irresistibly mastering him but he kept awake by an
excruciating pain in his arm for which he could find no satisfactory
position he kept closing his eyes and then again looking at the fire
which seemed to him dazzlingly red and at the feeble roundshouldered
figure of tushin who was sitting crosslegged like a turk beside him
tushins large kind intelligent eyes were fixed with sympathy and
commiseration on rostóv who saw that tushin with his whole heart wished
to help him but could not

from all sides were heard the footsteps and talk of the infantry who
were walking driving past and settling down all around the sound of
voices the tramping feet the horses hoofs moving in mud the
crackling of wood fires near and afar merged into one tremulous rumble

it was no longer as before a dark unseen river flowing through the
gloom but a dark sea swelling and gradually subsiding after a storm
rostóv looked at and listened listlessly to what passed before and
around him an infantryman came to the fire squatted on his heels held
his hands to the blaze and turned away his face

you dont mind your honor he asked tushin ive lost my company
your honor i dont know where such bad luck

with the soldier an infantry officer with a bandaged cheek came up to
the bonfire and addressing tushin asked him to have the guns moved a
trifle to let a wagon go past after he had gone two soldiers rushed to
the campfire they were quarreling and fighting desperately each trying
to snatch from the other a boot they were both holding on to

you picked it up i dare say youre very smart one of them
shouted hoarsely

then a thin pale soldier his neck bandaged with a bloodstained leg
band came up and in angry tones asked the artillerymen for water

must one die like a dog said he

tushin told them to give the man some water then a cheerful soldier ran
up begging a little fire for the infantry

a nice little hot torch for the infantry good luck to you fellow
countrymen thanks for the firewell return it with interest said he
carrying away into the darkness a glowing stick

next came four soldiers carrying something heavy on a cloak and passed
by the fire one of them stumbled

who the devil has put the logs on the road snarled he

hes deadwhy carry him said another

shut up

and they disappeared into the darkness with their load

still aching tushin asked rostóv in a whisper

yes

your honor youre wanted by the general he is in the hut here said
a gunner coming up to tushin

coming friend

tushin rose and buttoning his greatcoat and pulling it straight walked
away from the fire

not far from the artillery campfire in a hut that had been prepared for
him prince bagration sat at dinner talking with some commanding
officers who had gathered at his quarters the little old man with the
halfclosed eyes was there greedily gnawing a mutton bone and the
general who had served blamelessly for twentytwo years flushed by a
glass of vodka and the dinner and the staff officer with the signet
ring and zherkov uneasily glancing at them all and prince andrew
pale with compressed lips and feverishly glittering eyes

in a corner of the hut stood a standard captured from the french and
the accountant with the naïve face was feeling its texture shaking his
head in perplexityperhaps because the banner really interested him
perhaps because it was hard for him hungry as he was to look on at a
dinner where there was no place for him in the next hut there was a
french colonel who had been taken prisoner by our dragoons our officers
were flocking in to look at him prince bagration was thanking the
individual commanders and inquiring into details of the action and our
losses the general whose regiment had been inspected at braunau was
informing the prince that as soon as the action began he had withdrawn
from the wood mustered the men who were woodcutting and allowing the
french to pass him had made a bayonet charge with two battalions and
had broken up the french troops

when i saw your excellency that their first battalion was
disorganized i stopped in the road and thought ill let them come on
and will meet them with the fire of the whole battalionand thats what
i did

the general had so wished to do this and was so sorry he had not managed
to do it that it seemed to him as if it had really happened perhaps it
might really have been so could one possibly make out amid all that
confusion what did or did not happen

by the way your excellency i should inform you he
continuedremembering dólokhovs conversation with kutúzov and his last
interview with the gentlemanrankerthat private dólokhov who was
reduced to the ranks took a french officer prisoner in my presence and
particularly distinguished himself

i saw the pávlograd hussars attack there your excellency chimed in
zherkov looking uneasily around he had not seen the hussars all that
day but had heard about them from an infantry officer they broke up
two squares your excellency

several of those present smiled at zherkovs words expecting one of his
usual jokes but noticing that what he was saying redounded to the glory
of our arms and of the days work they assumed a serious expression
though many of them knew that what he was saying was a lie devoid of any
foundation prince bagration turned to the old colonel

gentlemen i thank you all all arms have behaved heroically infantry
cavalry and artillery how was it that two guns were abandoned in the
center he inquired searching with his eyes for someone prince
bagration did not ask about the guns on the left flank he knew that all
the guns there had been abandoned at the very beginning of the action
i think i sent you he added turning to the staff officer on duty

one was damaged answered the staff officer and the other i cant
understand i was there all the time giving orders and had only just
left it is true that it was hot there he added modestly

someone mentioned that captain tushin was bivouacking close to the
village and had already been sent for

oh but you were there said prince bagration addressing prince
andrew

of course we only just missed one another said the staff officer
with a smile to bolkónski

i had not the pleasure of seeing you said prince andrew coldly and
abruptly

all were silent tushin appeared at the threshold and made his way
timidly from behind the backs of the generals as he stepped past the
generals in the crowded hut feeling embarrassed as he always was by the
sight of his superiors he did not notice the staff of the banner and
stumbled over it several of those present laughed

how was it a gun was abandoned asked bagration frowning not so much
at the captain as at those who were laughing among whom zherkov laughed
loudest

only now when he was confronted by the stern authorities did his guilt
and the disgrace of having lost two guns and yet remaining alive present
themselves to tushin in all their horror he had been so excited that he
had not thought about it until that moment the officers laughter
confused him still more he stood before bagration with his lower jaw
trembling and was hardly able to mutter i dont know your
excellency i had no men your excellency

you might have taken some from the covering troops

tushin did not say that there were no covering troops though that was
perfectly true he was afraid of getting some other officer into
trouble and silently fixed his eyes on bagration as a schoolboy who has
blundered looks at an examiner

the silence lasted some time prince bagration apparently not wishing
to be severe found nothing to say the others did not venture to
intervene prince andrew looked at tushin from under his brows and his
fingers twitched nervously

your excellency prince andrew broke the silence with his abrupt
voice you were pleased to send me to captain tushins battery i went
there and found two thirds of the men and horses knocked out two guns
smashed and no supports at all

prince bagration and tushin looked with equal intentness at bolkónski
who spoke with suppressed agitation

and if your excellency will allow me to express my opinion he
continued we owe todays success chiefly to the action of that battery
and the heroic endurance of captain tushin and his company and without
awaiting a reply prince andrew rose and left the table

prince bagration looked at tushin evidently reluctant to show distrust
in bolkónskis emphatic opinion yet not feeling able fully to credit it
bent his head and told tushin that he could go prince andrew went out
with him

thank you you saved me my dear fellow said tushin

prince andrew gave him a look but said nothing and went away he felt
sad and depressed it was all so strange so unlike what he had hoped

who are they why are they here what do they want and when will all
this end thought rostóv looking at the changing shadows before him
the pain in his arm became more and more intense irresistible
drowsiness overpowered him red rings danced before his eyes and the
impression of those voices and faces and a sense of loneliness merged
with the physical pain it was they these soldierswounded and
unwoundedit was they who were crushing weighing down and twisting the
sinews and scorching the flesh of his sprained arm and shoulder to rid
himself of them he closed his eyes

for a moment he dozed but in that short interval innumerable things
appeared to him in a dream his mother and her large white hand sónyas
thin little shoulders natáshas eyes and laughter denisov with his
voice and mustache and telyanin and all that affair with telyanin and
bogdanich that affair was the same thing as this soldier with the harsh
voice and it was that affair and this soldier that were so agonizingly
incessantly pulling and pressing his arm and always dragging it in one
direction he tried to get away from them but they would not for an
instant let his shoulder move a hairs breadth it would not acheit
would be wellif only they did not pull it but it was impossible to get
rid of them

he opened his eyes and looked up the black canopy of night hung less
than a yard above the glow of the charcoal flakes of falling snow were
fluttering in that light tushin had not returned the doctor had not
come he was alone now except for a soldier who was sitting naked at
the other side of the fire warming his thin yellow body

nobody wants me thought rostóv there is no one to help me or pity
me yet i was once at home strong happy and loved he sighed and
doing so groaned involuntarily

eh is anything hurting you asked the soldier shaking his shirt out
over the fire and not waiting for an answer he gave a grunt and added
what a lot of men have been crippled todayfrightful

rostóv did not listen to the soldier he looked at the snowflakes
fluttering above the fire and remembered a russian winter at his warm
bright home his fluffy fur coat his quickly gliding sleigh his
healthy body and all the affection and care of his family and why did
i come here he wondered

next day the french army did not renew their attack and the remnant of
bagrations detachment was reunited to kutúzovs army





book three





chapter i

prince vasíli was not a man who deliberately thought out his plans
still less did he think of injuring anyone for his own advantage he was
merely a man of the world who had got on and to whom getting on had
become a habit schemes and devices for which he never rightly accounted
to himself but which formed the whole interest of his life were
constantly shaping themselves in his mind arising from the
circumstances and persons he met of these plans he had not merely one
or two in his head but dozens some only beginning to form themselves
some approaching achievement and some in course of disintegration he
did not for instance say to himself this man now has influence i
must gain his confidence and friendship and through him obtain a special
grant nor did he say to himself pierre is a rich man i must entice
him to marry my daughter and lend me the forty thousand rubles i need
but when he came across a man of position his instinct immediately told
him that this man could be useful and without any premeditation prince
vasíli took the first opportunity to gain his confidence flatter him
become intimate with him and finally make his request

he had pierre at hand in moscow and procured for him an appointment as
gentleman of the bedchamber which at that time conferred the status of
councilor of state and insisted on the young man accompanying him to
petersburg and staying at his house with apparent absentmindedness
yet with unhesitating assurance that he was doing the right thing
prince vasíli did everything to get pierre to marry his daughter had he
thought out his plans beforehand he could not have been so natural and
shown such unaffected familiarity in intercourse with everybody both
above and below him in social standing something always drew him toward
those richer and more powerful than himself and he had rare skill in
seizing the most opportune moment for making use of people

pierre on unexpectedly becoming count bezúkhov and a rich man felt
himself after his recent loneliness and freedom from cares so beset and
preoccupied that only in bed was he able to be by himself he had to
sign papers to present himself at government offices the purpose of
which was not clear to him to question his chief steward to visit his
estate near moscow and to receive many people who formerly did not even
wish to know of his existence but would now have been offended and
grieved had he chosen not to see them these different
peoplebusinessmen relations and acquaintances alikewere all disposed
to treat the young heir in the most friendly and flattering manner they
were all evidently firmly convinced of pierres noble qualities he was
always hearing such words as with your remarkable kindness or with
your excellent heart you are yourself so honorable count or were
he as clever as you and so on till he began sincerely to believe in
his own exceptional kindness and extraordinary intelligence the more so
as in the depth of his heart it had always seemed to him that he really
was very kind and intelligent even people who had formerly been
spiteful toward him and evidently unfriendly now became gentle and
affectionate the angry eldest princess with the long waist and hair
plastered down like a dolls had come into pierres room after the
funeral with drooping eyes and frequent blushes she told him she was
very sorry about their past misunderstandings and did not now feel she
had a right to ask him for anything except only for permission after
the blow she had received to remain for a few weeks longer in the house
she so loved and where she had sacrificed so much she could not refrain
from weeping at these words touched that this statuesque princess could
so change pierre took her hand and begged her forgiveness without
knowing what for from that day the eldest princess quite changed toward
pierre and began knitting a striped scarf for him

do this for my sake mon cher after all she had to put up with a
great deal from the deceased said prince vasíli to him handing him a
deed to sign for the princess benefit

prince vasíli had come to the conclusion that it was necessary to throw
this bonea bill for thirty thousand rublesto the poor princess that it
might not occur to her to speak of his share in the affair of the inlaid
portfolio pierre signed the deed and after that the princess grew still
kinder the younger sisters also became affectionate to him especially
the youngest the pretty one with the mole who often made him feel
confused by her smiles and her own confusion when meeting him

it seemed so natural to pierre that everyone should like him and it
would have seemed so unnatural had anyone disliked him that he could
not but believe in the sincerity of those around him besides he had no
time to ask himself whether these people were sincere or not he was
always busy and always felt in a state of mild and cheerful
intoxication he felt as though he were the center of some important and
general movement that something was constantly expected of him that if
he did not do it he would grieve and disappoint many people but if he
did this and that all would be well and he did what was demanded of
him but still that happy result always remained in the future

more than anyone else prince vasíli took possession of pierres affairs
and of pierre himself in those early days from the death of count
bezúkhov he did not let go his hold of the lad he had the air of a man
oppressed by business weary and suffering who yet would not for
pitys sake leave this helpless youth who after all was the son of
his old friend and the possessor of such enormous wealth to the caprice
of fate and the designs of rogues during the few days he spent in
moscow after the death of count bezúkhov he would call pierre or go to
him himself and tell him what ought to be done in a tone of weariness
and assurance as if he were adding every time you know i am
overwhelmed with business and it is purely out of charity that i trouble
myself about you and you also know quite well that what i propose is
the only thing possible

well my dear fellow tomorrow we are off at last said prince vasíli
one day closing his eyes and fingering pierres elbow speaking as if
he were saying something which had long since been agreed upon and could
not now be altered we start tomorrow and im giving you a place in my
carriage i am very glad all our important business here is now
settled and i ought to have been off long ago here is something i have
received from the chancellor i asked him for you and you have been
entered in the diplomatic corps and made a gentleman of the bedchamber
the diplomatic career now lies open before you

notwithstanding the tone of wearied assurance with which these words
were pronounced pierre who had so long been considering his career
wished to make some suggestion but prince vasíli interrupted him in the
special deep cooing tone precluding the possibility of interrupting his
speech which he used in extreme cases when special persuasion was
needed

mais mon cher i did this for my own sake to satisfy my conscience
and there is nothing to thank me for no one has ever complained yet of
being too much loved and besides you are free you could throw it up
tomorrow but you will see everything for yourself when you get to
petersburg it is high time for you to get away from these terrible
recollections prince vasíli sighed yes yes my boy and my valet
can go in your carriage ah i was nearly forgetting he added you
know mon cher your father and i had some accounts to settle so i have
received what was due from the ryazan estate and will keep it you wont
require it well go into the accounts later

by what was due from the ryazan estate prince vasíli meant several
thousand rubles quitrent received from pierres peasants which the
prince had retained for himself

in petersburg as in moscow pierre found the same atmosphere of
gentleness and affection he could not refuse the post or rather the
rank for he did nothing that prince vasíli had procured for him and
acquaintances invitations and social occupations were so numerous
that even more than in moscow he felt a sense of bewilderment bustle
and continual expectation of some good always in front of him but never
attained

of his former bachelor acquaintances many were no longer in petersburg
the guards had gone to the front dólokhov had been reduced to the
ranks anatole was in the army somewhere in the provinces prince andrew
was abroad so pierre had not the opportunity to spend his nights as he
used to like to spend them or to open his mind by intimate talks with a
friend older than himself and whom he respected his whole time was
taken up with dinners and balls and was spent chiefly at prince vasílis
house in the company of the stout princess his wife and his beautiful
daughter hélène

like the others anna pávlovna schérer showed pierre the change of
attitude toward him that had taken place in society

formerly in anna pávlovnas presence pierre had always felt that what
he was saying was out of place tactless and unsuitable that remarks
which seemed to him clever while they formed in his mind became foolish
as soon as he uttered them while on the contrary hippolytes stupidest
remarks came out clever and apt now everything pierre said was
charmant even if anna pávlovna did not say so he could see that she
wished to and only refrained out of regard for his modesty

in the beginning of the winter of  pierre received one of anna
pávlovnas usual pink notes with an invitation to which was added you
will find the beautiful hélène here whom it is always delightful to
see

when he read that sentence pierre felt for the first time that some
link which other people recognized had grown up between himself and
hélène and that thought both alarmed him as if some obligation were
being imposed on him which he could not fulfill and pleased him as an
entertaining supposition

anna pávlovnas at home was like the former one only the novelty she
offered her guests this time was not mortemart but a diplomatist fresh
from berlin with the very latest details of the emperor alexanders
visit to potsdam and of how the two august friends had pledged
themselves in an indissoluble alliance to uphold the cause of justice
against the enemy of the human race anna pávlovna received pierre with
a shade of melancholy evidently relating to the young mans recent loss
by the death of count bezúkhov everyone constantly considered it a duty
to assure pierre that he was greatly afflicted by the death of the
father he had hardly known and her melancholy was just like the august
melancholy she showed at the mention of her most august majesty the
empress márya fëdorovna pierre felt flattered by this anna pávlovna
arranged the different groups in her drawing room with her habitual
skill the large group in which were prince vasíli and the generals
had the benefit of the diplomat another group was at the tea table
pierre wished to join the former but anna pávlovnawho was in the
excited condition of a commander on a battlefield to whom thousands of
new and brilliant ideas occur which there is hardly time to put in
actionseeing pierre touched his sleeve with her finger saying

wait a bit i have something in view for you this evening she
glanced at hélène and smiled at her my dear hélène be charitable to
my poor aunt who adores you go and keep her company for ten minutes
and that it will not be too dull here is the dear count who will not
refuse to accompany you

the beauty went to the aunt but anna pávlovna detained pierre looking
as if she had to give some final necessary instructions

isnt she exquisite she said to pierre pointing to the stately
beauty as she glided away and how she carries herself for so young a
girl such tact such masterly perfection of manner it comes from her
heart happy the man who wins her with her the least worldly of men
would occupy a most brilliant position in society dont you think so i
only wanted to know your opinion and anna pávlovna let pierre go

pierre in reply sincerely agreed with her as to hélènes perfection of
manner if he ever thought of hélène it was just of her beauty and her
remarkable skill in appearing silently dignified in society

the old aunt received the two young people in her corner but seemed
desirous of hiding her adoration for hélène and inclined rather to show
her fear of anna pávlovna she looked at her niece as if inquiring what
she was to do with these people on leaving them anna pávlovna again
touched pierres sleeve saying i hope you wont say that it is dull
in my house again and she glanced at hélène

hélène smiled with a look implying that she did not admit the
possibility of anyone seeing her without being enchanted the aunt
coughed swallowed and said in french that she was very pleased to see
hélène then she turned to pierre with the same words of welcome and the
same look in the middle of a dull and halting conversation hélène
turned to pierre with the beautiful bright smile that she gave to
everyone pierre was so used to that smile and it had so little meaning
for him that he paid no attention to it the aunt was just speaking of
a collection of snuffboxes that had belonged to pierres father count
bezúkhov and showed them her own box princess hélène asked to see the
portrait of the aunts husband on the box lid

that is probably the work of vinesse said pierre mentioning a
celebrated miniaturist and he leaned over the table to take the
snuffbox while trying to hear what was being said at the other table

he half rose meaning to go round but the aunt handed him the snuffbox
passing it across hélènes back hélène stooped forward to make room
and looked round with a smile she was as always at evening parties
wearing a dress such as was then fashionable cut very low at front and
back her bust which had always seemed like marble to pierre was so
close to him that his shortsighted eyes could not but perceive the
living charm of her neck and shoulders so near to his lips that he need
only have bent his head a little to have touched them he was conscious
of the warmth of her body the scent of perfume and the creaking of her
corset as she moved he did not see her marble beauty forming a complete
whole with her dress but all the charm of her body only covered by her
garments and having once seen this he could not help being aware of it
just as we cannot renew an illusion we have once seen through

so you have never noticed before how beautiful i am hélène seemed to
say you had not noticed that i am a woman yes i am a woman who may
belong to anyoneto you too said her glance and at that moment pierre
felt that hélène not only could but must be his wife and that it
could not be otherwise

he knew this at that moment as surely as if he had been standing at the
altar with her how and when this would be he did not know he did not
even know if it would be a good thing he even felt he knew not why
that it would be a bad thing but he knew it would happen

pierre dropped his eyes lifted them again and wished once more to see
her as a distant beauty far removed from him as he had seen her every
day until then but he could no longer do it he could not any more
than a man who has been looking at a tuft of steppe grass through the
mist and taking it for a tree can again take it for a tree after he has
once recognized it to be a tuft of grass she was terribly close to him
she already had power over him and between them there was no longer any
barrier except the barrier of his own will

well i will leave you in your little corner came anna pávlovnas
voice i see you are all right there

and pierre anxiously trying to remember whether he had done anything
reprehensible looked round with a blush it seemed to him that everyone
knew what had happened to him as he knew it himself

a little later when he went up to the large circle anna pávlovna said
to him i hear you are refitting your petersburg house

this was true the architect had told him that it was necessary and
pierre without knowing why was having his enormous petersburg house
done up

thats a good thing but dont move from prince vasílis it is good to
have a friend like the prince she said smiling at prince vasíli i
know something about that dont i and you are still so young you need
advice dont be angry with me for exercising an old womans privilege

she paused as women always do expecting something after they have
mentioned their age if you marry it will be a different thing she
continued uniting them both in one glance pierre did not look at
hélène nor she at him but she was just as terribly close to him he
muttered something and colored

when he got home he could not sleep for a long time for thinking of what
had happened what had happened nothing he had merely understood that
the woman he had known as a child of whom when her beauty was mentioned
he had said absentmindedly yes shes good looking he had
understood that this woman might belong to him

but shes stupid i have myself said she is stupid he thought there
is something nasty something wrong in the feeling she excites in me i
have been told that her brother anatole was in love with her and she
with him that there was quite a scandal and that thats why he was sent
away hippolyte is her brother prince vasíli is her father its
bad he reflected but while he was thinking this the reflection
was still incomplete he caught himself smiling and was conscious that
another line of thought had sprung up and while thinking of her
worthlessness he was also dreaming of how she would be his wife how she
would love him become quite different and how all he had thought and
heard of her might be false and he again saw her not as the daughter of
prince vasíli but visualized her whole body only veiled by its gray
dress but no why did this thought never occur to me before and
again he told himself that it was impossible that there would be
something unnatural and as it seemed to him dishonorable in this
marriage he recalled her former words and looks and the words and looks
of those who had seen them together he recalled anna pávlovnas words
and looks when she spoke to him about his house recalled thousands of
such hints from prince vasíli and others and was seized by terror lest
he had already in some way bound himself to do something that was
evidently wrong and that he ought not to do but at the very time he was
expressing this conviction to himself in another part of his mind her
image rose in all its womanly beauty





chapter ii

in november  prince vasíli had to go on a tour of inspection in
four different provinces he had arranged this for himself so as to
visit his neglected estates at the same time and pick up his son anatole
where his regiment was stationed and take him to visit prince nicholas
bolkónski in order to arrange a match for him with the daughter of that
rich old man but before leaving home and undertaking these new affairs
prince vasíli had to settle matters with pierre who it is true had
latterly spent whole days at home that is in prince vasílis house
where he was staying and had been absurd excited and foolish in
hélènes presence as a lover should be but had not yet proposed to
her

this is all very fine but things must be settled said prince vasíli
to himself with a sorrowful sigh one morning feeling that pierre who
was under such obligations to him but never mind that was not
behaving very well in this matter youth frivolity well god be
with him thought he relishing his own goodness of heart but it must
be brought to a head the day after tomorrow will be lelyas name day i
will invite two or three people and if he does not understand what he
ought to do then it will be my affairyes my affair i am her father

six weeks after anna pávlovnas at home and after the sleepless night
when he had decided that to marry hélène would be a calamity and that he
ought to avoid her and go away pierre despite that decision had not
left prince vasílis and felt with terror that in peoples eyes he was
every day more and more connected with her that it was impossible for
him to return to his former conception of her that he could not break
away from her and that though it would be a terrible thing he would
have to unite his fate with hers he might perhaps have been able to
free himself but that prince vasíli who had rarely before given
receptions now hardly let a day go by without having an evening party
at which pierre had to be present unless he wished to spoil the general
pleasure and disappoint everyones expectation prince vasíli in the
rare moments when he was at home would take pierres hand in passing
and draw it downwards or absentmindedly hold out his wrinkled clean
shaven cheek for pierre to kiss and would say till tomorrow or be
in to dinner or i shall not see you or i am staying in for your
sake and so on and though prince vasíli when he stayed in as he
said for pierres sake hardly exchanged a couple of words with him
pierre felt unable to disappoint him every day he said to himself one
and the same thing it is time i understood her and made up my mind
what she really is was i mistaken before or am i mistaken now no she
is not stupid she is an excellent girl he sometimes said to himself
she never makes a mistake never says anything stupid she says little
but what she does say is always clear and simple so she is not stupid
she never was abashed and is not abashed now so she cannot be a bad
woman he had often begun to make reflections or think aloud in her
company and she had always answered him either by a brief but
appropriate remarkshowing that it did not interest heror by a silent
look and smile which more palpably than anything else showed pierre her
superiority she was right in regarding all arguments as nonsense in
comparison with that smile

she always addressed him with a radiantly confiding smile meant for him
alone in which there was something more significant than in the general
smile that usually brightened her face pierre knew that everyone was
waiting for him to say a word and cross a certain line and he knew that
sooner or later he would step across it but an incomprehensible terror
seized him at the thought of that dreadful step a thousand times during
that month and a half while he felt himself drawn nearer and nearer to
that dreadful abyss pierre said to himself what am i doing i need
resolution can it be that i have none

he wished to take a decision but felt with dismay that in this matter
he lacked that strength of will which he had known in himself and really
possessed pierre was one of those who are only strong when they feel
themselves quite innocent and since that day when he was overpowered by
a feeling of desire while stooping over the snuffbox at anna pávlovnas
an unacknowledged sense of the guilt of that desire paralyzed his will

on hélènes name day a small party of just their own peopleas his wife
saidmet for supper at prince vasílis all these friends and relations
had been given to understand that the fate of the young girl would be
decided that evening the visitors were seated at supper princess
kurágina a portly imposing woman who had once been handsome was
sitting at the head of the table on either side of her sat the more
important guestsan old general and his wife and anna pávlovna schérer
at the other end sat the younger and less important guests and there
too sat the members of the family and pierre and hélène side by side
prince vasíli was not having any supper he went round the table in a
merry mood sitting down now by one now by another of the guests to
each of them he made some careless and agreeable remark except to pierre
and hélène whose presence he seemed not to notice he enlivened the
whole party the wax candles burned brightly the silver and crystal
gleamed so did the ladies toilets and the gold and silver of the mens
epaulets servants in scarlet liveries moved round the table the
clatter of plates knives and glasses mingled with the animated hum of
several conversations at one end of the table the old chamberlain was
heard assuring an old baroness that he loved her passionately at which
she laughed at the other could be heard the story of the misfortunes of
some mary viktorovna or other at the center of the table prince vasíli
attracted everybodys attention with a facetious smile on his face he
was telling the ladies about last wednesdays meeting of the imperial
council at which sergey kuzmich vyazmitinov the new military governor
general of petersburg had received and read the then famous rescript of
the emperor alexander from the army to sergey kuzmich in which the
emperor said that he was receiving from all sides declarations of the
peoples loyalty that the declaration from petersburg gave him
particular pleasure and that he was proud to be at the head of such a
nation and would endeavor to be worthy of it this rescript began with
the words sergey kuzmich from all sides reports reach me etc

well and so he never got farther than sergey kuzmich asked one of
the ladies

exactly not a hairs breadth farther answered prince vasíli
laughing sergey kuzmich from all sides from all sides sergey
kuzmich poor vyazmitinov could not get any farther he began the
rescript again and again but as soon as he uttered sergey he sobbed
kuzmich tears and from all sides was smothered in sobs and he
could get no farther and again his handkerchief and again sergey
kuzmich from all sides and tears till at last somebody else was
asked to read it

kuzmich from all sides and then tears someone repeated
laughing

dont be unkind cried anna pávlovna from her end of the table holding
up a threatening finger he is such a worthy and excellent man our
dear vyazmitinov

everybody laughed a great deal at the head of the table where the
honored guests sat everyone seemed to be in high spirits and under the
influence of a variety of exciting sensations only pierre and hélène
sat silently side by side almost at the bottom of the table a
suppressed smile brightening both their faces a smile that had nothing
to do with sergey kuzmicha smile of bashfulness at their own feelings
but much as all the rest laughed talked and joked much as they
enjoyed their rhine wine saute and ices and however they avoided
looking at the young couple and heedless and unobservant as they seemed
of them one could feel by the occasional glances they gave that the
story about sergey kuzmich the laughter and the food were all a
pretense and that the whole attention of that company was directed
topierre and hélène prince vasíli mimicked the sobbing of sergey
kuzmich and at the same time his eyes glanced toward his daughter and
while he laughed the expression on his face clearly said yes its
getting on it will all be settled today anna pávlovna threatened him
on behalf of our dear vyazmitinov and in her eyes which for an
instant glanced at pierre prince vasíli read a congratulation on his
future soninlaw and on his daughters happiness the old princess
sighed sadly as she offered some wine to the old lady next to her and
glanced angrily at her daughter and her sigh seemed to say yes
theres nothing left for you and me but to sip sweet wine my dear now
that the time has come for these young ones to be thus boldly
provocatively happy and what nonsense all this is that i am saying
thought a diplomatist glancing at the happy faces of the lovers
thats happiness

into the insignificant trifling and artificial interests uniting that
society had entered the simple feeling of the attraction of a healthy
and handsome young man and woman for one another and this human feeling
dominated everything else and soared above all their affected chatter
jests fell flat news was not interesting and the animation was
evidently forced not only the guests but even the footmen waiting at
table seemed to feel this and they forgot their duties as they looked
at the beautiful hélène with her radiant face and at the red broad and
happy though uneasy face of pierre it seemed as if the very light of
the candles was focused on those two happy faces alone

pierre felt that he was the center of it all and this both pleased and
embarrassed him he was like a man entirely absorbed in some occupation
he did not see hear or understand anything clearly only now and then
detached ideas and impressions from the world of reality shot
unexpectedly through his mind

so it is all finished he thought and how has it all happened how
quickly now i know that not because of her alone nor of myself alone
but because of everyone it must inevitably come about they are all
expecting it they are so sure that it will happen that i cannot i
cannot disappoint them but how will it be i do not know but it will
certainly happen thought pierre glancing at those dazzling shoulders
close to his eyes

or he would suddenly feel ashamed of he knew not what he felt it
awkward to attract everyones attention and to be considered a lucky man
and with his plain face to be looked on as a sort of paris possessed
of a helen but no doubt it always is and must be so he consoled
himself and besides what have i done to bring it about how did it
begin i traveled from moscow with prince vasíli then there was
nothing so why should i not stay at his house then i played cards with
her and picked up her reticule and drove out with her how did it begin
when did it all come about and here he was sitting by her side as her
betrothed seeing hearing feeling her nearness her breathing her
movements her beauty then it would suddenly seem to him that it was
not she but he was so unusually beautiful and that that was why they
all looked so at him and flattered by this general admiration he would
expand his chest raise his head and rejoice at his good fortune
suddenly he heard a familiar voice repeating something to him a second
time but pierre was so absorbed that he did not understand what was
said

i am asking you when you last heard from bolkónski repeated prince
vasíli a third time how absentminded you are my dear fellow

prince vasíli smiled and pierre noticed that everyone was smiling at
him and hélène well what of it if you all know it thought pierre
what of it its the truth and he himself smiled his gentle childlike
smile and hélène smiled too

when did you get the letter was it from olmutz repeated prince
vasíli who pretended to want to know this in order to settle a dispute

how can one talk or think of such trifles thought pierre

yes from olmutz he answered with a sigh

after supper pierre with his partner followed the others into the
drawing room the guests began to disperse some without taking leave of
hélène some as if unwilling to distract her from an important
occupation came up to her for a moment and made haste to go away
refusing to let her see them off the diplomatist preserved a mournful
silence as he left the drawing room he pictured the vanity of his
diplomatic career in comparison with pierres happiness the old general
grumbled at his wife when she asked how his leg was oh the old fool
he thought that princess hélène will be beautiful still when shes
fifty

i think i may congratulate you whispered anna pávlovna to the old
princess kissing her soundly if i hadnt this headache id have
stayed longer

the old princess did not reply she was tormented by jealousy of her
daughters happiness

while the guests were taking their leave pierre remained for a long time
alone with hélène in the little drawing room where they were sitting he
had often before during the last six weeks remained alone with her
but had never spoken to her of love now he felt that it was inevitable
but he could not make up his mind to take the final step he felt
ashamed he felt that he was occupying someone elses place here beside
hélène this happiness is not for you some inner voice whispered to
him this happiness is for those who have not in them what there is in
you

but as he had to say something he began by asking her whether she was
satisfied with the party she replied in her usual simple manner that
this name day of hers had been one of the pleasantest she had ever had

some of the nearest relatives had not yet left they were sitting in the
large drawing room prince vasíli came up to pierre with languid
footsteps pierre rose and said it was getting late prince vasíli gave
him a look of stern inquiry as though what pierre had just said was so
strange that one could not take it in but then the expression of
severity changed and he drew pierres hand downwards made him sit
down and smiled affectionately

well lelya he asked turning instantly to his daughter and
addressing her with the careless tone of habitual tenderness natural to
parents who have petted their children from babyhood but which prince
vasíli had only acquired by imitating other parents

and he again turned to pierre

sergey kuzmichfrom all sides he said unbuttoning the top button of
his waistcoat

pierre smiled but his smile showed that he knew it was not the story
about sergey kuzmich that interested prince vasíli just then and prince
vasíli saw that pierre knew this he suddenly muttered something and
went away it seemed to pierre that even the prince was disconcerted
the sight of the discomposure of that old man of the world touched
pierre he looked at hélène and she too seemed disconcerted and her
look seemed to say well it is your own fault

the step must be taken but i cannot i cannot thought pierre and he
again began speaking about indifferent matters about sergey kuzmich
asking what the point of the story was as he had not heard it properly
hélène answered with a smile that she too had missed it

when prince vasíli returned to the drawing room the princess his wife
was talking in low tones to the elderly lady about pierre

of course it is a very brilliant match but happiness my dear

marriages are made in heaven replied the elderly lady

prince vasíli passed by seeming not to hear the ladies and sat down on
a sofa in a far corner of the room he closed his eyes and seemed to be
dozing his head sank forward and then he roused himself

aline he said to his wife go and see what they are about

the princess went up to the door passed by it with a dignified and
indifferent air and glanced into the little drawing room pierre and
hélène still sat talking just as before

still the same she said to her husband

prince vasíli frowned twisting his mouth his cheeks quivered and his
face assumed the coarse unpleasant expression peculiar to him shaking
himself he rose threw back his head and with resolute steps went past
the ladies into the little drawing room with quick steps he went
joyfully up to pierre his face was so unusually triumphant that pierre
rose in alarm on seeing it

thank god said prince vasíli my wife has told me everything he
put one arm around pierre and the other around his daughtermy dear
boy lelya i am very pleased his voice trembled i loved your
father and she will make you a good wife god bless you

he embraced his daughter and then again pierre and kissed him with his
malodorous mouth tears actually moistened his cheeks

princess come here he shouted

the old princess came in and also wept the elderly lady was using her
handkerchief too pierre was kissed and he kissed the beautiful
hélènes hand several times after a while they were left alone again

all this had to be and could not be otherwise thought pierre so it
is useless to ask whether it is good or bad it is good because its
definite and one is rid of the old tormenting doubt pierre held the
hand of his betrothed in silence looking at her beautiful bosom as it
rose and fell

hélène he said aloud and paused

something special is always said in such cases he thought but could
not remember what it was that people say he looked at her face she
drew nearer to him her face flushed

oh take those off those she said pointing to his spectacles

pierre took them off and his eyes besides the strange look eyes have
from which spectacles have just been removed had also a frightened and
inquiring look he was about to stoop over her hand and kiss it but
with a rapid almost brutal movement of her head she intercepted his
lips and met them with her own her face struck pierre by its altered
unpleasantly excited expression

it is too late now its done besides i love her thought pierre

je vous aime  he said remembering what has to be said at such
moments but his words sounded so weak that he felt ashamed of himself

 i love you

six weeks later he was married and settled in count bezúkhovs large
newly furnished petersburg house the happy possessor as people said
of a wife who was a celebrated beauty and of millions of money





chapter iii

old prince nicholas bolkónski received a letter from prince vasíli in
november  announcing that he and his son would be paying him a
visit i am starting on a journey of inspection and of course i shall
think nothing of an extra seventy miles to come and see you at the same
time my honored benefactor wrote prince vasíli my son anatole is
accompanying me on his way to the army so i hope you will allow him
personally to express the deep respect that emulating his father he
feels for you

it seems that there will be no need to bring mary out suitors are
coming to us of their own accord incautiously remarked the little
princess on hearing the news

prince nicholas frowned but said nothing

a fortnight after the letter prince vasílis servants came one evening
in advance of him and he and his son arrived next day

old bolkónski had always had a poor opinion of prince vasílis
character but more so recently since in the new reigns of paul and
alexander prince vasíli had risen to high position and honors and now
from the hints contained in his letter and given by the little princess
he saw which way the wind was blowing and his low opinion changed into
a feeling of contemptuous ill will he snorted whenever he mentioned
him on the day of prince vasílis arrival prince bolkónski was
particularly discontented and out of temper whether he was in a bad
temper because prince vasíli was coming or whether his being in a bad
temper made him specially annoyed at prince vasílis visit he was in a
bad temper and in the morning tíkhon had already advised the architect
not to go to the prince with his report

do you hear how hes walking said tíkhon drawing the architects
attention to the sound of the princes footsteps stepping flat on his
heelswe know what that means

however at nine oclock the prince in his velvet coat with a sable
collar and cap went out for his usual walk it had snowed the day
before and the path to the hothouse along which the prince was in the
habit of walking had been swept the marks of the broom were still
visible in the snow and a shovel had been left sticking in one of the
soft snowbanks that bordered both sides of the path the prince went
through the conservatories the serfs quarters and the outbuildings
frowning and silent

can a sleigh pass he asked his overseer a venerable man resembling
his master in manners and looks who was accompanying him back to the
house

the snow is deep i am having the avenue swept your honor

the prince bowed his head and went up to the porch god be thanked
thought the overseer the storm has blown over

it would have been hard to drive up your honor he added i heard
your honor that a minister is coming to visit your honor

the prince turned round to the overseer and fixed his eyes on him
frowning

what a minister what minister who gave orders he said in his
shrill harsh voice the road is not swept for the princess my
daughter but for a minister for me there are no ministers

your honor i thought

you thought shouted the prince his words coming more and more
rapidly and indistinctly you thought rascals blackguards ill
teach you to think and lifting his stick he swung it and would have
hit alpatych the overseer had not the latter instinctively avoided the
blow thought blackguards shouted the prince rapidly

but although alpatych frightened at his own temerity in avoiding the
stroke came up to the prince bowing his bald head resignedly before
him or perhaps for that very reason the prince though he continued to
shout blackguards throw the snow back on the road did not lift
his stick again but hurried into the house

before dinner princess mary and mademoiselle bourienne who knew that
the prince was in a bad humor stood awaiting him mademoiselle
bourienne with a radiant face that said i know nothing i am the same
as usual and princess mary pale frightened and with downcast eyes
what she found hardest to bear was to know that on such occasions she
ought to behave like mademoiselle bourienne but could not she thought
if i seem not to notice he will think that i do not sympathize with
him if i seem sad and out of spirits myself he will say as he has
done before that im in the dumps

the prince looked at his daughters frightened face and snorted

fool or dummy he muttered

and the other one is not here theyve been telling tales he
thoughtreferring to the little princess who was not in the dining room

where is the princess he asked hiding

she is not very well answered mademoiselle bourienne with a bright
smile so she wont come down it is natural in her state

hm hm muttered the prince sitting down

his plate seemed to him not quite clean and pointing to a spot he flung
it away tíkhon caught it and handed it to a footman the little
princess was not unwell but had such an overpowering fear of the prince
that hearing he was in a bad humor she had decided not to appear

i am afraid for the baby she said to mademoiselle bourienne heaven
knows what a fright might do

in general at bald hills the little princess lived in constant fear and
with a sense of antipathy to the old prince which she did not realize
because the fear was so much the stronger feeling the prince
reciprocated this antipathy but it was overpowered by his contempt for
her when the little princess had grown accustomed to life at bald
hills she took a special fancy to mademoiselle bourienne spent whole
days with her asked her to sleep in her room and often talked with her
about the old prince and criticized him

so we are to have visitors mon prince remarked mademoiselle
bourienne unfolding her white napkin with her rosy fingers his
excellency prince vasíli kurágin and his son i understand she said
inquiringly

hmhis excellency is a puppy i got him his appointment in the
service said the prince disdainfully why his son is coming i dont
understand perhaps princess elizabeth and princess mary know i dont
want him he looked at his blushing daughter are you unwell today
eh afraid of the minister as that idiot alpatych called him this
morning

no mon pere

though mademoiselle bourienne had been so unsuccessful in her choice of
a subject she did not stop talking but chattered about the
conservatories and the beauty of a flower that had just opened and
after the soup the prince became more genial

after dinner he went to see his daughterinlaw the little princess
was sitting at a small table chattering with másha her maid she grew
pale on seeing her fatherinlaw

she was much altered she was now plain rather than pretty her cheeks
had sunk her lip was drawn up and her eyes drawn down

yes i feel a kind of oppression she said in reply to the princes
question as to how she felt

do you want anything

no merci mon pere

well all right all right

he left the room and went to the waiting room where alpatych stood with
bowed head

has the snow been shoveled back

yes your excellency forgive me for heavens sake it was only my
stupidity

all right all right interrupted the prince and laughing his
unnatural way he stretched out his hand for alpatych to kiss and then
proceeded to his study

prince vasíli arrived that evening he was met in the avenue by coachmen
and footmen who with loud shouts dragged his sleighs up to one of the
lodges over the road purposely laden with snow

prince vasíli and anatole had separate rooms assigned to them

anatole having taken off his overcoat sat with arms akimbo before a
table on a corner of which he smilingly and absentmindedly fixed his
large and handsome eyes he regarded his whole life as a continual round
of amusement which someone for some reason had to provide for him and
he looked on this visit to a churlish old man and a rich and ugly
heiress in the same way all this might he thought turn out very well
and amusingly and why not marry her if she really has so much money
that never does any harm thought anatole

he shaved and scented himself with the care and elegance which had
become habitual to him and his handsome head held high entered his
fathers room with the goodhumored and victorious air natural to him
prince vasílis two valets were busy dressing him and he looked round
with much animation and cheerfully nodded to his son as the latter
entered as if to say yes thats how i want you to look

i say father joking apart is she very hideous anatole asked as if
continuing a conversation the subject of which had often been mentioned
during the journey

enough what nonsense above all try to be respectful and cautious
with the old prince

if he starts a row ill go away said prince anatole i cant bear
those old men eh

remember for you everything depends on this

in the meantime not only was it known in the maidservants rooms that
the minister and his son had arrived but the appearance of both had
been minutely described princess mary was sitting alone in her room
vainly trying to master her agitation

why did they write why did lise tell me about it it can never
happen she said looking at herself in the glass how shall i enter
the drawing room even if i like him i cant now be myself with him
the mere thought of her fathers look filled her with terror the little
princess and mademoiselle bourienne had already received from másha the
ladys maid the necessary report of how handsome the ministers son
was with his rosy cheeks and dark eyebrows and with what difficulty
the father had dragged his legs upstairs while the son had followed him
like an eagle three steps at a time having received this information
the little princess and mademoiselle bourienne whose chattering voices
had reached her from the corridor went into princess marys room

you know theyve come marie said the little princess waddling in
and sinking heavily into an armchair

she was no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in the morning
but had on one of her best dresses her hair was carefully done and her
face was animated which however did not conceal its sunken and faded
outlines dressed as she used to be in petersburg society it was still
more noticeable how much plainer she had become some unobtrusive touch
had been added to mademoiselle bouriennes toilet which rendered her
fresh and pretty face yet more attractive

what are you going to remain as you are dear princess she began
theyll be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing room and we
shall have to go down and you have not smartened yourself up at all

the little princess got up rang for the maid and hurriedly and merrily
began to devise and carry out a plan of how princess mary should be
dressed princess marys selfesteem was wounded by the fact that the
arrival of a suitor agitated her and still more so by both her
companions not having the least conception that it could be otherwise
to tell them that she felt ashamed for herself and for them would be to
betray her agitation while to decline their offers to dress her would
prolong their banter and insistence she flushed her beautiful eyes
grew dim red blotches came on her face and it took on the unattractive
martyrlike expression it so often wore as she submitted herself to
mademoiselle bourienne and lise both these women quite sincerely tried
to make her look pretty she was so plain that neither of them could
think of her as a rival so they began dressing her with perfect
sincerity and with the naïve and firm conviction women have that dress
can make a face pretty

no really my dear this dress is not pretty said lise looking
sideways at princess mary from a little distance you have a maroon
dress have it fetched really you know the fate of your whole life may
be at stake but this one is too light its not becoming

it was not the dress but the face and whole figure of princess mary
that was not pretty but neither mademoiselle bourienne nor the little
princess felt this they still thought that if a blue ribbon were placed
in the hair the hair combed up and the blue scarf arranged lower on
the best maroon dress and so on all would be well they forgot that
the frightened face and the figure could not be altered and that
however they might change the setting and adornment of that face it
would still remain piteous and plain after two or three changes to
which princess mary meekly submitted just as her hair had been arranged
on the top of her head a style that quite altered and spoiled her
looks and she had put on a maroon dress with a paleblue scarf the
little princess walked twice round her now adjusting a fold of the
dress with her little hand now arranging the scarf and looking at her
with her head bent first on one side and then on the other

no it will not do she said decidedly clasping her hands no mary
really this dress does not suit you i prefer you in your little gray
everyday dress now please do it for my sake katie she said to the
maid bring the princess her gray dress and youll see mademoiselle
bourienne how i shall arrange it she added smiling with a foretaste
of artistic pleasure

but when katie brought the required dress princess mary remained
sitting motionless before the glass looking at her face and saw in the
mirror her eyes full of tears and her mouth quivering ready to burst
into sobs

come dear princess said mademoiselle bourienne just one more
little effort

the little princess taking the dress from the maid came up to princess
mary

well now well arrange something quite simple and becoming she said

the three voices hers mademoiselle bouriennes and katies who was
laughing at something mingled in a merry sound like the chirping of
birds

no leave me alone said princess mary

her voice sounded so serious and so sad that the chirping of the birds
was silenced at once they looked at the beautiful large thoughtful
eyes full of tears and of thoughts gazing shiningly and imploringly at
them and understood that it was useless and even cruel to insist

at least change your coiffure said the little princess didnt i
tell you she went on turning reproachfully to mademoiselle bourienne
marys is a face which such a coiffure does not suit in the least not
in the least please change it

leave me alone please leave me alone it is all quite the same to me
answered a voice struggling with tears

mademoiselle bourienne and the little princess had to own to themselves
that princess mary in this guise looked very plain worse than usual
but it was too late she was looking at them with an expression they
both knew an expression thoughtful and sad this expression in princess
mary did not frighten them she never inspired fear in anyone but they
knew that when it appeared on her face she became mute and was not to
be shaken in her determination

you will change it wont you said lise and as princess mary gave no
answer she left the room

princess mary was left alone she did not comply with lises request
she not only left her hair as it was but did not even look in her
glass letting her arms fall helplessly she sat with downcast eyes and
pondered a husband a man a strong dominant and strangely attractive
being rose in her imagination and carried her into a totally different
happy world of his own she fancied a child her ownsuch as she had
seen the day before in the arms of her nurses daughterat her own
breast the husband standing by and gazing tenderly at her and the
child but no it is impossible i am too ugly she thought

please come to tea the prince will be out in a moment came the
maids voice at the door

she roused herself and felt appalled at what she had been thinking and
before going down she went into the room where the icons hung and her
eyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon of the saviour lit by a
lamp she stood before it with folded hands for a few moments a painful
doubt filled her soul could the joy of love of earthly love for a man
be for her in her thoughts of marriage princess mary dreamed of
happiness and of children but her strongest most deeply hidden longing
was for earthly love the more she tried to hide this feeling from
others and even from herself the stronger it grew o god she said
how am i to stifle in my heart these temptations of the devil how am i
to renounce forever these vile fancies so as peacefully to fulfill thy
will and scarcely had she put that question than god gave her the
answer in her own heart desire nothing for thyself seek nothing be
not anxious or envious mans future and thy own fate must remain hidden
from thee but live so that thou mayest be ready for anything if it be
gods will to prove thee in the duties of marriage be ready to fulfill
his will with this consoling thought but yet with a hope for the
fulfillment of her forbidden earthly longing princess mary sighed and
having crossed herself went down thinking neither of her gown and
coiffure nor of how she would go in nor of what she would say what
could all that matter in comparison with the will of god without whose
care not a hair of mans head can fall





chapter iv

when princess mary came down prince vasíli and his son were already in
the drawing room talking to the little princess and mademoiselle
bourienne when she entered with her heavy step treading on her heels
the gentlemen and mademoiselle bourienne rose and the little princess
indicating her to the gentlemen said voila marie princess mary saw
them all and saw them in detail she saw prince vasílis face serious
for an instant at the sight of her but immediately smiling again and
the little princess curiously noting the impression marie produced on
the visitors and she saw mademoiselle bourienne with her ribbon and
pretty face and her unusually animated look which was fixed on him but
him she could not see she only saw something large brilliant and
handsome moving toward her as she entered the room prince vasíli
approached first and she kissed the bold forehead that bent over her
hand and answered his question by saying that on the contrary she
remembered him quite well then anatole came up to her she still could
not see him she only felt a soft hand taking hers firmly and she
touched with her lips a white forehead over which was beautiful light
brown hair smelling of pomade when she looked up at him she was struck
by his beauty anatole stood with his right thumb under a button of his
uniform his chest expanded and his back drawn in slightly swinging one
foot and with his head a little bent looked with beaming face at the
princess without speaking and evidently not thinking about her at all
anatole was not quickwitted nor ready or eloquent in conversation but
he had the faculty so invaluable in society of composure and
imperturbable selfpossession if a man lacking in selfconfidence
remains dumb on a first introduction and betrays a consciousness of the
impropriety of such silence and an anxiety to find something to say the
effect is bad but anatole was dumb swung his foot and smilingly
examined the princess hair it was evident that he could be silent in
this way for a very long time if anyone finds this silence
inconvenient let him talk but i dont want to he seemed to say
besides this in his behavior to women anatole had a manner which
particularly inspires in them curiosity awe and even lovea
supercilious consciousness of his own superiority it was as if he said
to them i know you i know you but why should i bother about you
youd be only too glad of course perhaps he did not really think this
when he met womeneven probably he did not for in general he thought
very littlebut his looks and manner gave that impression the princess
felt this and as if wishing to show him that she did not even dare
expect to interest him she turned to his father the conversation was
general and animated thanks to princess lises voice and little downy
lip that lifted over her white teeth she met prince vasíli with that
playful manner often employed by lively chatty people and consisting in
the assumption that between the person they so address and themselves
there are some semiprivate longestablished jokes and amusing
reminiscences though no such reminiscences really existjust as none
existed in this case prince vasíli readily adopted her tone and the
little princess also drew anatole whom she hardly knew into these
amusing recollections of things that had never occurred mademoiselle
bourienne also shared them and even princess mary felt herself
pleasantly made to share in these merry reminiscences

here at least we shall have the benefit of your company all to
ourselves dear prince said the little princess of course in french
to prince vasíli its not as at annettes  receptions where you
always ran away you remember cette chere annette

 anna pávlovna

ah but you wont talk politics to me like annette

and our little tea table

oh yes

why is it you were never at annettes the little princess asked
anatole ah i know i know she said with a sly glance your brother
hippolyte told me about your goings on oh and she shook her finger at
him i have even heard of your doings in paris

and didnt hippolyte tell you asked prince vasíli turning to his son
and seizing the little princess arm as if she would have run away and
he had just managed to catch her didnt he tell you how he himself was
pining for the dear princess and how she showed him the door oh she
is a pearl among women princess he added turning to princess mary

when paris was mentioned mademoiselle bourienne for her part seized the
opportunity of joining in the general current of recollections

she took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since anatole had
left paris and how he had liked that city anatole answered the
frenchwoman very readily and looking at her with a smile talked to her
about her native land when he saw the pretty little bourienne anatole
came to the conclusion that he would not find bald hills dull either
not at all bad he thought examining her not at all bad that
little companion i hope she will bring her along with her when were
married la petite est gentille

 the little one is charming

the old prince dressed leisurely in his study frowning and considering
what he was to do the coming of these visitors annoyed him what are
prince vasíli and that son of his to me prince vasíli is a shallow
braggart and his son no doubt is a fine specimen he grumbled to
himself what angered him was that the coming of these visitors revived
in his mind an unsettled question he always tried to stifle one about
which he always deceived himself the question was whether he could ever
bring himself to part from his daughter and give her to a husband the
prince never directly asked himself that question knowing beforehand
that he would have to answer it justly and justice clashed not only
with his feelings but with the very possibility of life life without
princess mary little as he seemed to value her was unthinkable to him
and why should she marry he thought to be unhappy for certain
theres lise married to andrewa better husband one would think could
hardly be found nowadaysbut is she contented with her lot and who
would marry marie for love plain and awkward theyll take her for her
connections and wealth are there no women living unmarried and even
the happier for it so thought prince bolkónski while dressing and yet
the question he was always putting off demanded an immediate answer
prince vasíli had brought his son with the evident intention of
proposing and today or tomorrow he would probably ask for an answer
his birth and position in society were not bad well ive nothing
against it the prince said to himself but he must be worthy of her
and that is what we shall see

that is what we shall see that is what we shall see he added aloud

he entered the drawing room with his usual alert step glancing rapidly
round the company he noticed the change in the little princess dress
mademoiselle bouriennes ribbon princess marys unbecoming coiffure
mademoiselle bouriennes and anatoles smiles and the loneliness of his
daughter amid the general conversation got herself up like a fool he
thought looking irritably at her she is shameless and he ignores
her

he went straight up to prince vasíli

well how dye do how dye do glad to see you

friendship laughs at distance began prince vasíli in his usual rapid
selfconfident familiar tone here is my second son please love and
befriend him

prince bolkónski surveyed anatole

fine young fellow fine young fellow he said well come and kiss
me and he offered his cheek

anatole kissed the old man and looked at him with curiosity and perfect
composure waiting for a display of the eccentricities his father had
told him to expect

prince bolkónski sat down in his usual place in the corner of the sofa
and drawing up an armchair for prince vasíli pointed to it and began
questioning him about political affairs and news he seemed to listen
attentively to what prince vasíli said but kept glancing at princess
mary

and so they are writing from potsdam already he said repeating
prince vasílis last words then rising he suddenly went up to his
daughter

is it for visitors youve got yourself up like that eh said he
fine very fine you have done up your hair in this new way for the
visitors and before the visitors i tell you that in future you are
never to dare to change your way of dress without my consent

it was my fault mon pere interceded the little princess with a
blush

you must do as you please said prince bolkónski bowing to his
daughterinlaw but she need not make a fool of herself shes plain
enough as it is

and he sat down again paying no more attention to his daughter who was
reduced to tears

on the contrary that coiffure suits the princess very well said
prince vasíli

now you young prince whats your name said prince bolkónski
turning to anatole come here let us talk and get acquainted

now the fun begins thought anatole sitting down with a smile beside
the old prince

well my dear boy i hear youve been educated abroad not taught to
read and write by the deacon like your father and me now tell me my
dear boy are you serving in the horse guards asked the old man
scrutinizing anatole closely and intently

no i have been transferred to the line said anatole hardly able to
restrain his laughter

ah thats a good thing so my dear boy you wish to serve the tsar
and the country it is wartime such a fine fellow must serve well are
you off to the front

no prince our regiment has gone to the front but i am attached
what is it i am attached to papa said anatole turning to his father
with a laugh

a splendid soldier splendid what am i attached to ha ha ha
laughed prince bolkónski and anatole laughed still louder suddenly
prince bolkónski frowned

you may go he said to anatole

anatole returned smiling to the ladies

and so youve had him educated abroad prince vasíli havent you
said the old prince to prince vasíli

i have done my best for him and i can assure you the education there
is much better than ours

yes everything is different nowadays everything is changed the lads
a fine fellow a fine fellow well come with me now he took prince
vasílis arm and led him to his study as soon as they were alone
together prince vasíli announced his hopes and wishes to the old
prince

well do you think i shall prevent her that i cant part from her
said the old prince angrily what an idea im ready for it tomorrow
only let me tell you i want to know my soninlaw better you know my
principleseverything aboveboard i will ask her tomorrow in your
presence if she is willing then he can stay on he can stay and ill
see the old prince snorted let her marry its all the same to me
he screamed in the same piercing tone as when parting from his son

i will tell you frankly said prince vasíli in the tone of a crafty
man convinced of the futility of being cunning with so keensighted a
companion you know you see right through people anatole is no
genius but he is an honest goodhearted lad an excellent son or
kinsman

all right all right well see

as always happens when women lead lonely lives for any length of time
without male society on anatoles appearance all the three women of
prince bolkónskis household felt that their life had not been real till
then their powers of reasoning feeling and observing immediately
increased tenfold and their life which seemed to have been passed in
darkness was suddenly lit up by a new brightness full of significance

princess mary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure the
handsome open face of the man who might perhaps be her husband absorbed
all her attention he seemed to her kind brave determined manly and
magnanimous she felt convinced of that thousands of dreams of a future
family life continually rose in her imagination she drove them away and
tried to conceal them

but am i not too cold with him thought the princess i try to be
reserved because in the depth of my soul i feel too near to him already
but then he cannot know what i think of him and may imagine that i do
not like him

and princess mary tried but could not manage to be cordial to her new
guest poor girl shes devilish ugly thought anatole

mademoiselle bourienne also roused to great excitement by anatoles
arrival thought in another way of course she a handsome young woman
without any definite position without relations or even a country did
not intend to devote her life to serving prince bolkónski to reading
aloud to him and being friends with princess mary mademoiselle
bourienne had long been waiting for a russian prince who able to
appreciate at a glance her superiority to the plain badly dressed
ungainly russian princesses would fall in love with her and carry her
off and here at last was a russian prince mademoiselle bourienne knew
a story heard from her aunt but finished in her own way which she
liked to repeat to herself it was the story of a girl who had been
seduced and to whom her poor mother sa pauvre mere appeared and
reproached her for yielding to a man without being married mademoiselle
bourienne was often touched to tears as in imagination she told this
story to him her seducer and now he a real russian prince had
appeared he would carry her away and then sa pauvre mere would appear
and he would marry her so her future shaped itself in mademoiselle
bouriennes head at the very time she was talking to anatole about
paris it was not calculation that guided her she did not even for a
moment consider what she should do but all this had long been familiar
to her and now that anatole had appeared it just grouped itself around
him and she wished and tried to please him as much as possible

the little princess like an old war horse that hears the trumpet
unconsciously and quite forgetting her condition prepared for the
familiar gallop of coquetry without any ulterior motive or any
struggle but with naïve and lighthearted gaiety

although in female society anatole usually assumed the role of a man
tired of being run after by women his vanity was flattered by the
spectacle of his power over these three women besides that he was
beginning to feel for the pretty and provocative mademoiselle bourienne
that passionate animal feeling which was apt to master him with great
suddenness and prompt him to the coarsest and most reckless actions

after tea the company went into the sitting room and princess mary was
asked to play on the clavichord anatole laughing and in high spirits
came and leaned on his elbows facing her and beside mademoiselle
bourienne princess mary felt his look with a painfully joyous emotion
her favorite sonata bore her into a most intimately poetic world and the
look she felt upon her made that world still more poetic but anatoles
expression though his eyes were fixed on her referred not to her but
to the movements of mademoiselle bouriennes little foot which he was
then touching with his own under the clavichord mademoiselle bourienne
was also looking at princess mary and in her lovely eyes there was a
look of fearful joy and hope that was also new to the princess

how she loves me thought princess mary how happy i am now and how
happy i may be with such a friend and such a husband husband can it be
possible she thought not daring to look at his face but still
feeling his eyes gazing at her

in the evening after supper when all were about to retire anatole
kissed princess marys hand she did not know how she found the courage
but she looked straight into his handsome face as it came near to her
shortsighted eyes turning from princess mary he went up and kissed
mademoiselle bouriennes hand this was not etiquette but then he did
everything so simply and with such assurance mademoiselle bourienne
flushed and gave the princess a frightened look

what delicacy thought the princess is it possible that amelie
mademoiselle bourienne thinks i could be jealous of her and not
value her pure affection and devotion to me she went up to her and
kissed her warmly anatole went up to kiss the little princess hand

no no no when your father writes to tell me that you are behaving
well i will give you my hand to kiss not till then she said and
smilingly raising a finger at him she left the room





chapter v

they all separated but except anatole who fell asleep as soon as he
got into bed all kept awake a long time that night

is he really to be my husband this stranger who is so kindyes kind
that is the chief thing thought princess mary and fear which she had
seldom experienced came upon her she feared to look round it seemed
to her that someone was there standing behind the screen in the dark
corner and this someone was hethe deviland he was also this man with
the white forehead black eyebrows and red lips

she rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in her room

mademoiselle bourienne walked up and down the conservatory for a long
time that evening vainly expecting someone now smiling at someone now
working herself up to tears with the imaginary words of her pauvre mere
rebuking her for her fall

the little princess grumbled to her maid that her bed was badly made
she could not lie either on her face or on her side every position was
awkward and uncomfortable and her burden oppressed her now more than
ever because anatoles presence had vividly recalled to her the time
when she was not like that and when everything was light and gay she
sat in an armchair in her dressing jacket and nightcap and katie sleepy
and disheveled beat and turned the heavy feather bed for the third
time muttering to herself

i told you it was all lumps and holes the little princess repeated
i should be glad enough to fall asleep so its not my fault and her
voice quivered like that of a child about to cry

the old prince did not sleep either tíkhon half asleep heard him
pacing angrily about and snorting the old prince felt as though he had
been insulted through his daughter the insult was the more pointed
because it concerned not himself but another his daughter whom he
loved more than himself he kept telling himself that he would consider
the whole matter and decide what was right and how he should act but
instead of that he only excited himself more and more

the first man that turns upshe forgets her father and everything else
runs upstairs and does up her hair and wags her tail and is unlike
herself glad to throw her father over and she knew i should notice it
fr fr fr and dont i see that that idiot had eyes only for
bouriennei shall have to get rid of her and how is it she has not
pride enough to see it if she has no pride for herself she might at
least have some for my sake she must be shown that the blockhead thinks
nothing of her and looks only at bourienne no she has no pride but
ill let her see

the old prince knew that if he told his daughter she was making a
mistake and that anatole meant to flirt with mademoiselle bourienne
princess marys selfesteem would be wounded and his point not to be
parted from her would be gained so pacifying himself with this
thought he called tíkhon and began to undress

what devil brought them here thought he while tíkhon was putting the
nightshirt over his driedup old body and grayhaired chest i never
invited them they came to disturb my lifeand there is not much of it
left

devil take em he muttered while his head was still covered by the
shirt

tíkhon knew his masters habit of sometimes thinking aloud and
therefore met with unaltered looks the angrily inquisitive expression of
the face that emerged from the shirt

gone to bed asked the prince

tíkhon like all good valets instinctively knew the direction of his
masters thoughts he guessed that the question referred to prince
vasíli and his son

they have gone to bed and put out their lights your excellency

no good no good said the prince rapidly and thrusting his feet
into his slippers and his arms into the sleeves of his dressing gown he
went to the couch on which he slept

though no words had passed between anatole and mademoiselle bourienne
they quite understood one another as to the first part of their romance
up to the appearance of the pauvre mere they understood that they had
much to say to one another in private and so they had been seeking an
opportunity since morning to meet one another alone when princess mary
went to her fathers room at the usual hour mademoiselle bourienne and
anatole met in the conservatory

princess mary went to the door of the study with special trepidation it
seemed to her that not only did everybody know that her fate would be
decided that day but that they also knew what she thought about it she
read this in tíkhons face and in that of prince vasílis valet who
made her a low bow when she met him in the corridor carrying hot water

the old prince was very affectionate and careful in his treatment of his
daughter that morning princess mary well knew this painstaking
expression of her fathers his face wore that expression when his dry
hands clenched with vexation at her not understanding a sum in
arithmetic when rising from his chair he would walk away from her
repeating in a low voice the same words several times over

he came to the point at once treating her ceremoniously

i have had a proposition made me concerning you he said with an
unnatural smile i expect you have guessed that prince vasíli has not
come and brought his pupil with him for some reason prince bolkónski
referred to anatole as a pupil for the sake of my beautiful eyes
last night a proposition was made me on your account and as you know my
principles i refer it to you

how am i to understand you mon pere said the princess growing pale
and then blushing

how understand me cried her father angrily prince vasíli finds you
to his taste as a daughterinlaw and makes a proposal to you on his
pupils behalf thats how its to be understood how understand
it and i ask you

i do not know what you think father whispered the princess

i i what of me leave me out of the question im not going to get
married what about you thats what i want to know

the princess saw that her father regarded the matter with disapproval
but at that moment the thought occurred to her that her fate would be
decided now or never she lowered her eyes so as not to see the gaze
under which she felt that she could not think but would only be able to
submit from habit and she said i wish only to do your will but if i
had to express my own desire she had no time to finish the old
prince interrupted her

thats admirable he shouted he will take you with your dowry and
take mademoiselle bourienne into the bargain shell be the wife while
you

the prince stopped he saw the effect these words had produced on his
daughter she lowered her head and was ready to burst into tears

now then now then im only joking he said remember this
princess i hold to the principle that a maiden has a full right to
choose i give you freedom only remember that your lifes happiness
depends on your decision never mind me

but i do not know father

theres no need to talk he receives his orders and will marry you or
anybody but you are free to choose go to your room think it over
and come back in an hour and tell me in his presence yes or no i know
you will pray over it well pray if you like but you had better think
it over go yes or no yes or no yes or no he still shouted when the
princess as if lost in a fog had already staggered out of the study

her fate was decided and happily decided but what her father had said
about mademoiselle bourienne was dreadful it was untrue to be sure but
still it was terrible and she could not help thinking of it she was
going straight on through the conservatory neither seeing nor hearing
anything when suddenly the wellknown whispering of mademoiselle
bourienne aroused her she raised her eyes and two steps away saw
anatole embracing the frenchwoman and whispering something to her with
a horrified expression on his handsome face anatole looked at princess
mary but did not at once take his arm from the waist of mademoiselle
bourienne who had not yet seen her

whos that why wait a moment anatoles face seemed to say princess
mary looked at them in silence she could not understand it at last
mademoiselle bourienne gave a scream and ran away anatole bowed to
princess mary with a gay smile as if inviting her to join in a laugh at
this strange incident and then shrugging his shoulders went to the door
that led to his own apartments

an hour later tíkhon came to call princess mary to the old prince he
added that prince vasíli was also there when tíkhon came to her
princess mary was sitting on the sofa in her room holding the weeping
mademoiselle bourienne in her arms and gently stroking her hair the
princess beautiful eyes with all their former calm radiance were
looking with tender affection and pity at mademoiselle bouriennes
pretty face

no princess i have lost your affection forever said mademoiselle
bourienne

why i love you more than ever said princess mary and i will try to
do all i can for your happiness

but you despise me you who are so pure can never understand being so
carried away by passion oh only my poor mother

i quite understand answered princess mary with a sad smile calm
yourself my dear i will go to my father she said and went out

prince vasíli with one leg thrown high over the other and a snuffbox in
his hand was sitting there with a smile of deep emotion on his face as
if stirred to his hearts core and himself regretting and laughing at
his own sensibility when princess mary entered he hurriedly took a
pinch of snuff

ah my dear my dear he began rising and taking her by both hands
then sighing he added my sons fate is in your hands decide my
dear good gentle marie whom i have always loved as a daughter

he drew back and a real tear appeared in his eye

fr fr snorted prince bolkónski the prince is making a
proposition to you in his pupilsi mean his sonsname do you wish or
not to be prince anatole kurágins wife reply yes or no he shouted
and then i shall reserve the right to state my opinion also yes my
opinion and only my opinion added prince bolkónski turning to prince
vasíli and answering his imploring look yes or no

my desire is never to leave you father never to separate my life from
yours i dont wish to marry she answered positively glancing at
prince vasíli and at her father with her beautiful eyes

humbug nonsense humbug humbug humbug cried prince bolkónski
frowning and taking his daughters hand he did not kiss her but only
bending his forehead to hers just touched it and pressed her hand so
that she winced and uttered a cry

prince vasíli rose

my dear i must tell you that this is a moment i shall never never
forget but my dear will you not give us a little hope of touching
this heart so kind and generous say perhaps the future is so
long say perhaps

prince what i have said is all there is in my heart i thank you for
the honor but i shall never be your sons wife

well so thats finished my dear fellow i am very glad to have seen
you very glad go back to your rooms princess go said the old
prince very very glad to have seen you repeated he embracing
prince vasíli

my vocation is a different one thought princess mary my vocation is
to be happy with another kind of happiness the happiness of love and
selfsacrifice and cost what it may i will arrange poor amelies
happiness she loves him so passionately and so passionately repents i
will do all i can to arrange the match between them if he is not rich i
will give her the means i will ask my father and andrew i shall be so
happy when she is his wife she is so unfortunate a stranger alone
helpless and oh god how passionately she must love him if she could
so far forget herself perhaps i might have done the same thought
princess mary





chapter vi

it was long since the rostóvs had news of nicholas not till midwinter
was the count at last handed a letter addressed in his sons
handwriting on receiving it he ran on tiptoe to his study in alarm and
haste trying to escape notice closed the door and began to read the
letter

anna mikháylovna who always knew everything that passed in the house
on hearing of the arrival of the letter went softly into the room and
found the count with it in his hand sobbing and laughing at the same
time

anna mikháylovna though her circumstances had improved was still
living with the rostóvs

my dear friend said she in a tone of pathetic inquiry prepared to
sympathize in any way

the count sobbed yet more

nikolenka a letter wa a s wounded my darling boy
the countess promoted to be an officer thank god how tell the
little countess

anna mikháylovna sat down beside him with her own handkerchief wiped
the tears from his eyes and from the letter then having dried her own
eyes she comforted the count and decided that at dinner and till
teatime she would prepare the countess and after tea with gods help
would inform her

at dinner anna mikháylovna talked the whole time about the war news and
about nikolenka twice asked when the last letter had been received from
him though she knew that already and remarked that they might very
likely be getting a letter from him that day each time that these hints
began to make the countess anxious and she glanced uneasily at the count
and at anna mikháylovna the latter very adroitly turned the
conversation to insignificant matters natásha who of the whole
family was the most gifted with a capacity to feel any shades of
intonation look and expression pricked up her ears from the beginning
of the meal and was certain that there was some secret between her
father and anna mikháylovna that it had something to do with her
brother and that anna mikháylovna was preparing them for it bold as
she was natásha who knew how sensitive her mother was to anything
relating to nikolenka did not venture to ask any questions at dinner
but she was too excited to eat anything and kept wriggling about on her
chair regardless of her governess remarks after dinner she rushed
head long after anna mikháylovna and dashing at her flung herself on
her neck as soon as she overtook her in the sitting room

auntie darling do tell me what it is

nothing my dear

no dearest sweet one honey i wont give upi know you know
something

anna mikháylovna shook her head

you are a little slyboots she said

a letter from nikolenka im sure of it exclaimed natásha reading
confirmation in anna mikháylovnas face

but for gods sake be careful you know how it may affect your mamma

i will i will only tell me you wont then i will go and tell at
once

anna mikháylovna in a few words told her the contents of the letter
on condition that she should tell no one

no on my true word of honor said natásha crossing herself i wont
tell anyone and she ran off at once to sónya

nikolenka wounded a letter she announced in gleeful triumph

nicholas was all sónya said instantly turning white

natásha seeing the impression the news of her brothers wound produced
on sónya felt for the first time the sorrowful side of the news

she rushed to sónya hugged her and began to cry

a little wound but he has been made an officer he is well now he
wrote himself said she through her tears

there now its true that all you women are crybabies remarked pétya
pacing the room with large resolute strides now im very glad very
glad indeed that my brother has distinguished himself so you are all
blubberers and understand nothing

natásha smiled through her tears

you havent read the letter asked sónya

no but she said that it was all over and that hes now an officer

thank god said sónya crossing herself but perhaps she deceived
you let us go to mamma

pétya paced the room in silence for a time

if id been in nikolenkas place i would have killed even more of those
frenchmen he said what nasty brutes they are id have killed so
many that thered have been a heap of them

hold your tongue pétya what a goose you are

im not a goose but they are who cry about trifles said pétya

do you remember him natásha suddenly asked after a moments silence

sónya smiled

do i remember nicholas

no sónya but do you remember so that you remember him perfectly
remember everything said natásha with an expressive gesture
evidently wishing to give her words a very definite meaning i remember
nikolenka too i remember him well she said but i dont remember
borís i dont remember him a bit

what you dont remember borís asked sónya in surprise

its not that i dont rememberi know what he is like but not as i
remember nikolenka himi just shut my eyes and remember but borís
no she shut her eyes no theres nothing at all

oh natásha said sónya looking ecstatically and earnestly at her
friend as if she did not consider her worthy to hear what she meant to
say and as if she were saying it to someone else with whom joking was
out of the question i am in love with your brother once for all and
whatever may happen to him or to me shall never cease to love him as
long as i live

natásha looked at sónya with wondering and inquisitive eyes and said
nothing she felt that sónya was speaking the truth that there was such
love as sónya was speaking of but natásha had not yet felt anything
like it she believed it could be but did not understand it

shall you write to him she asked

sónya became thoughtful the question of how to write to nicholas and
whether she ought to write tormented her now that he was already an
officer and a wounded hero would it be right to remind him of herself
and as it might seem of the obligations to her he had taken on
himself

i dont know i think if he writes i will write too she said
blushing

and you wont feel ashamed to write to him

sónya smiled

no

and i should be ashamed to write to borís im not going to

why should you be ashamed

well i dont know its awkward and would make me ashamed

and i know why shed be ashamed said pétya offended by natáshas
previous remark its because she was in love with that fat one in
spectacles that was how pétya described his namesake the new count
bezúkhov and now shes in love with that singer he meant natáshas
italian singing master thats why shes ashamed

pétya youre a stupid said natásha

not more stupid than you madam said the nineyearold pétya with
the air of an old brigadier

the countess had been prepared by anna mikháylovnas hints at dinner on
retiring to her own room she sat in an armchair her eyes fixed on a
miniature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuffbox while the tears
kept coming into her eyes anna mikháylovna with the letter came on
tiptoe to the countess door and paused

dont come in she said to the old count who was following her come
later and she went in closing the door behind her

the count put his ear to the keyhole and listened

at first he heard the sound of indifferent voices then anna
mikháylovnas voice alone in a long speech then a cry then silence
then both voices together with glad intonations and then footsteps
anna mikháylovna opened the door her face wore the proud expression of
a surgeon who has just performed a difficult operation and admits the
public to appreciate his skill

it is done she said to the count pointing triumphantly to the
countess who sat holding in one hand the snuffbox with its portrait and
in the other the letter and pressing them alternately to her lips

when she saw the count she stretched out her arms to him embraced his
bald head over which she again looked at the letter and the portrait
and in order to press them again to her lips she slightly pushed away
the bald head véra natásha sónya and pétya now entered the room and
the reading of the letter began after a brief description of the
campaign and the two battles in which he had taken part and his
promotion nicholas said that he kissed his fathers and mothers hands
asking for their blessing and that he kissed véra natásha and pétya
besides that he sent greetings to monsieur schelling madame schoss
and his old nurse and asked them to kiss for him dear sónya whom he
loved and thought of just the same as ever when she heard this sónya
blushed so that tears came into her eyes and unable to bear the looks
turned upon her ran away into the dancing hall whirled round it at
full speed with her dress puffed out like a balloon and flushed and
smiling plumped down on the floor the countess was crying

why are you crying mamma asked véra from all he says one should be
glad and not cry

this was quite true but the count the countess and natásha looked at
her reproachfully and who is it she takes after thought the
countess

nicholas letter was read over hundreds of times and those who were
considered worthy to hear it had to come to the countess for she did
not let it out of her hands the tutors came and the nurses and
dmítri and several acquaintances and the countess reread the letter
each time with fresh pleasure and each time discovered in it fresh
proofs of nikolenkas virtues how strange how extraordinary how
joyful it seemed that her son the scarcely perceptible motion of whose
tiny limbs she had felt twenty years ago within her that son about whom
she used to have quarrels with the too indulgent count that son who had
first learned to say pear and then granny that this son should now
be away in a foreign land amid strange surroundings a manly warrior
doing some kind of mans work of his own without help or guidance the
universal experience of ages showing that children do grow
imperceptibly from the cradle to manhood did not exist for the
countess her sons growth toward manhood at each of its stages had
seemed as extraordinary to her as if there had never existed the
millions of human beings who grew up in the same way as twenty years
before it seemed impossible that the little creature who lived
somewhere under her heart would ever cry suck her breast and begin to
speak so now she could not believe that that little creature could be
this strong brave man this model son and officer that judging by this
letter he now was

what a style how charmingly he describes said she reading the
descriptive part of the letter and what a soul not a word about
himself not a word about some denisov or other though he himself
i dare say is braver than any of them he says nothing about his
sufferings what a heart how like him it is and how he has remembered
everybody not forgetting anyone i always said when he was only so
highi always said

for more than a week preparations were being made rough drafts of
letters to nicholas from all the household were written and copied out
while under the supervision of the countess and the solicitude of the
count money and all things necessary for the uniform and equipment of
the newly commissioned officer were collected anna mikháylovna
practical woman that she was had even managed by favor with army
authorities to secure advantageous means of communication for herself
and her son she had opportunities of sending her letters to the grand
duke constantine pavlovich who commanded the guards the rostóvs
supposed that the russian guards abroad was quite a definite address
and that if a letter reached the grand duke in command of the guards
there was no reason why it should not reach the pávlograd regiment
which was presumably somewhere in the same neighborhood and so it was
decided to send the letters and money by the grand dukes courier to
borís and borís was to forward them to nicholas the letters were from
the old count the countess pétya véra natásha and sónya and
finally there were six thousand rubles for his outfit and various other
things the old count sent to his son





chapter vii

on the twelfth of november kutúzovs active army in camp before
olmutz was preparing to be reviewed next day by the two emperorsthe
russian and the austrian the guards just arrived from russia spent
the night ten miles from olmutz and next morning were to come straight
to the review reaching the field at olmutz by ten oclock

that day nicholas rostóv received a letter from borís telling him that
the ismaylov regiment was quartered for the night ten miles from olmutz
and that he wanted to see him as he had a letter and money for him
rostóv was particularly in need of money now that the troops after
their active service were stationed near olmutz and the camp swarmed
with wellprovisioned sutlers and austrian jews offering all sorts of
tempting wares the pávlograds held feast after feast celebrating
awards they had received for the campaign and made expeditions to
olmutz to visit a certain caroline the hungarian who had recently
opened a restaurant there with girls as waitresses rostóv who had just
celebrated his promotion to a cornetcy and bought denisovs horse
bedouin was in debt all round to his comrades and the sutlers on
receiving borís letter he rode with a fellow officer to olmutz dined
there drank a bottle of wine and then set off alone to the guards
camp to find his old playmate rostóv had not yet had time to get his
uniform he had on a shabby cadet jacket decorated with a soldiers
cross equally shabby cadets riding breeches lined with worn leather
and an officers saber with a sword knot the don horse he was riding
was one he had bought from a cossack during the campaign and he wore a
crumpled hussar cap stuck jauntily back on one side of his head as he
rode up to the camp he thought how he would impress borís and all his
comrades of the guards by his appearancethat of a fighting hussar who
had been under fire

the guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip parading
their cleanliness and discipline they had come by easy stages their
knapsacks conveyed on carts and the austrian authorities had provided
excellent dinners for the officers at every halting place the regiments
had entered and left the town with their bands playing and by the grand
dukes orders the men had marched all the way in step a practice on
which the guards prided themselves the officers on foot and at their
proper posts borís had been quartered and had marched all the way
with berg who was already in command of a company berg who had
obtained his captaincy during the campaign had gained the confidence of
his superiors by his promptitude and accuracy and had arranged his money
matters very satisfactorily borís during the campaign had made the
acquaintance of many persons who might prove useful to him and by a
letter of recommendation he had brought from pierre had become
acquainted with prince andrew bolkónski through whom he hoped to obtain
a post on the commanderinchiefs staff berg and borís having rested
after yesterdays march were sitting clean and neatly dressed at a
round table in the clean quarters allotted to them playing chess berg
held a smoking pipe between his knees borís in the accurate way
characteristic of him was building a little pyramid of chessmen with
his delicate white fingers while awaiting bergs move and watched his
opponents face evidently thinking about the game as he always thought
only of whatever he was engaged on

well how are you going to get out of that he remarked

well try to replied berg touching a pawn and then removing his
hand

at that moment the door opened

here he is at last shouted rostóv and berg too oh you
petisenfans allay cushay dormir he exclaimed imitating his russian
nurses french at which he and borís used to laugh long ago

dear me how you have changed

borís rose to meet rostóv but in doing so did not omit to steady and
replace some chessmen that were falling he was about to embrace his
friend but nicholas avoided him with that peculiar feeling of youth
that dread of beaten tracks and wish to express itself in a manner
different from that of its elders which is often insincere nicholas
wished to do something special on meeting his friend he wanted to pinch
him push him do anything but kiss hima thing everybody did but
notwithstanding this borís embraced him in a quiet friendly way and
kissed him three times

they had not met for nearly half a year and being at the age when young
men take their first steps on lifes road each saw immense changes in
the other quite a new reflection of the society in which they had taken
those first steps both had changed greatly since they last met and both
were in a hurry to show the changes that had taken place in them

oh you damned dandies clean and fresh as if youd been to a fete not
like us sinners of the line cried rostóv with martial swagger and
with baritone notes in his voice new to borís pointing to his own mud
bespattered breeches the german landlady hearing rostóvs loud voice
popped her head in at the door

eh is she pretty he asked with a wink

why do you shout so youll frighten them said borís i did not
expect you today he added i only sent you the note yesterday by
bolkónskian adjutant of kutúzovs whos a friend of mine i did not
think he would get it to you so quickly well how are you been
under fire already asked borís

without answering rostóv shook the soldiers cross of st george
fastened to the cording of his uniform and indicating a bandaged arm
glanced at berg with a smile

as you see he said

indeed yes yes said borís with a smile and we too have had a
splendid march you know of course that his imperial highness rode
with our regiment all the time so that we had every comfort and every
advantage what receptions we had in poland what dinners and balls i
cant tell you and the tsarevich was very gracious to all our
officers

and the two friends told each other of their doings the one of his
hussar revels and life in the fighting line the other of the pleasures
and advantages of service under members of the imperial family

oh you guards said rostóv i say send for some wine

borís made a grimace

if you really want it said he

he went to his bed drew a purse from under the clean pillow and sent
for wine

yes and i have some money and a letter to give you he added

rostóv took the letter and throwing the money on the sofa put both
arms on the table and began to read after reading a few lines he
glanced angrily at berg then meeting his eyes hid his face behind the
letter

well theyve sent you a tidy sum said berg eying the heavy purse
that sank into the sofa as for us count we get along on our pay i
can tell you for myself

i say berg my dear fellow said rostóv when you get a letter from
home and meet one of your own people whom you want to talk everything
over with and i happen to be there ill go at once to be out of your
way do go somewhere anywhere to the devil he exclaimed and
immediately seizing him by the shoulder and looking amiably into his
face evidently wishing to soften the rudeness of his words he added
dont be hurt my dear fellow you know i speak from my heart as to an
old acquaintance

oh dont mention it count i quite understand said berg getting up
and speaking in a muffled and guttural voice

go across to our hosts they invited you added borís

berg put on the cleanest of coats without a spot or speck of dust
stood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his temples
upwards in the way affected by the emperor alexander and having
assured himself from the way rostóv looked at it that his coat had been
noticed left the room with a pleasant smile

oh dear what a beast i am muttered rostóv as he read the letter

why

oh what a pig i am not to have written and to have given them such a
fright oh what a pig i am he repeated flushing suddenly well
have you sent gabriel for some wine all right lets have some

in the letter from his parents was enclosed a letter of recommendation
to bagration which the old countess at anna mikháylovnas advice had
obtained through an acquaintance and sent to her son asking him to take
it to its destination and make use of it

what nonsense much i need it said rostóv throwing the letter under
the table

why have you thrown that away asked borís

it is some letter of recommendation what the devil do i want it
for

why what the devil said borís picking it up and reading the
address this letter would be of great use to you

i want nothing and i wont be anyones adjutant

why not inquired borís

its a lackeys job

you are still the same dreamer i see remarked borís shaking his
head

and youre still the same diplomatist but thats not the point
come how are you asked rostóv

well as you see so far everythings all right but i confess i should
much like to be an adjutant and not remain at the front

why

because when once a man starts on military service he should try to
make as successful a career of it as possible

oh thats it said rostóv evidently thinking of something else

he looked intently and inquiringly into his friends eyes evidently
trying in vain to find the answer to some question

old gabriel brought in the wine

shouldnt we now send for berg asked borís he would drink with you
i cant

well send for him and how do you get on with that german asked
rostóv with a contemptuous smile

he is a very very nice honest and pleasant fellow answered borís

again rostóv looked intently into borís eyes and sighed berg returned
and over the bottle of wine conversation between the three officers
became animated the guardsmen told rostóv of their march and how they
had been made much of in russia poland and abroad they spoke of the
sayings and doings of their commander the grand duke and told stories
of his kindness and irascibility berg as usual kept silent when the
subject did not relate to himself but in connection with the stories of
the grand dukes quick temper he related with gusto how in galicia he
had managed to deal with the grand duke when the latter made a tour of
the regiments and was annoyed at the irregularity of a movement with a
pleasant smile berg related how the grand duke had ridden up to him in a
violent passion shouting arnauts arnauts was the tsarevichs
favorite expression when he was in a rage and called for the company
commander

would you believe it count i was not at all alarmed because i knew i
was right without boasting you know i may say that i know the army
orders by heart and know the regulations as well as i do the lords
prayer so count there never is any negligence in my company and so
my conscience was at ease i came forward berg stood up and showed
how he presented himself with his hand to his cap and really it would
have been difficult for a face to express greater respect and self
complacency than his did well he stormed at me as the saying is
stormed and stormed and stormed it was not a matter of life but rather
of death as the saying is albanians and devils and to
siberia said berg with a sagacious smile i knew i was in the right
so i kept silent was not that best count hey are you dumb he
shouted still i remained silent and what do you think count the next
day it was not even mentioned in the orders of the day thats what
keeping ones head means thats the way count said berg lighting
his pipe and emitting rings of smoke

yes that was fine said rostóv smiling

but borís noticed that he was preparing to make fun of berg and
skillfully changed the subject he asked him to tell them how and where
he got his wound this pleased rostóv and he began talking about it and
as he went on became more and more animated he told them of his schon
grabern affair just as those who have taken part in a battle generally
do describe it that is as they would like it to have been as they
have heard it described by others and as sounds well but not at all as
it really was rostóv was a truthful young man and would on no account
have told a deliberate lie he began his story meaning to tell
everything just as it happened but imperceptibly involuntarily and
inevitably he lapsed into falsehood if he had told the truth to his
hearerswho like himself had often heard stories of attacks and had
formed a definite idea of what an attack was and were expecting to hear
just such a storythey would either not have believed him or still
worse would have thought that rostóv was himself to blame since what
generally happens to the narrators of cavalry attacks had not happened
to him he could not tell them simply that everyone went at a trot and
that he fell off his horse and sprained his arm and then ran as hard as
he could from a frenchman into the wood besides to tell everything as
it really happened it would have been necessary to make an effort of
will to tell only what happened it is very difficult to tell the truth
and young people are rarely capable of it his hearers expected a story
of how beside himself and all aflame with excitement he had flown like
a storm at the square cut his way in slashed right and left how his
saber had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted and so on and so he
told them all that

in the middle of his story just as he was saying you cannot imagine
what a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack prince andrew
whom borís was expecting entered the room prince andrew who liked to
help young men was flattered by being asked for his assistance and
being well disposed toward borís who had managed to please him the day
before he wished to do what the young man wanted having been sent with
papers from kutúzov to the tsarevich he looked in on borís hoping to
find him alone when he came in and saw an hussar of the line recounting
his military exploits prince andrew could not endure that sort of man
he gave borís a pleasant smile frowned as with halfclosed eyes he
looked at rostóv bowed slightly and wearily and sat down languidly on
the sofa he felt it unpleasant to have dropped in on bad company
rostóv flushed up on noticing this but he did not care this was a mere
stranger glancing however at borís he saw that he too seemed ashamed
of the hussar of the line

in spite of prince andrews disagreeable ironical tone in spite of the
contempt with which rostóv from his fighting army point of view
regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer
was evidently one rostóv felt confused blushed and became silent
borís inquired what news there might be on the staff and what without
indiscretion one might ask about our plans

we shall probably advance replied bolkónski evidently reluctant to
say more in the presence of a stranger

berg took the opportunity to ask with great politeness whether as was
rumored the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be
doubled to this prince andrew answered with a smile that he could give
no opinion on such an important government order and berg laughed
gaily

as to your business prince andrew continued addressing borís we
will talk of it later and he looked round at rostóv come to me
after the review and we will do what is possible

and having glanced round the room prince andrew turned to rostóv
whose state of unconquerable childish embarrassment now changing to
anger he did not condescend to notice and said i think you were
talking of the schon grabern affair were you there

i was there said rostóv angrily as if intending to insult the aide
decamp

bolkónski noticed the hussars state of mind and it amused him with a
slightly contemptuous smile he said yes there are many stories now
told about that affair

yes stories repeated rostóv loudly looking with eyes suddenly grown
furious now at borís now at bolkónski yes many stories but our
stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemys fire our
stories have some weight not like the stories of those fellows on the
staff who get rewards without doing anything

of whom you imagine me to be one said prince andrew with a quiet and
particularly amiable smile

a strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for this mans
selfpossession mingled at that moment in rostóvs soul

i am not talking about you he said i dont know you and frankly i
dont want to i am speaking of the staff in general

and i will tell you this prince andrew interrupted in a tone of quiet
authority you wish to insult me and i am ready to agree with you that
it would be very easy to do so if you havent sufficient selfrespect
but admit that the time and place are very badly chosen in a day or two
we shall all have to take part in a greater and more serious duel and
besides drubetskóy who says he is an old friend of yours is not at
all to blame that my face has the misfortune to displease you however
he added rising you know my name and where to find me but dont
forget that i do not regard either myself or you as having been at all
insulted and as a man older than you my advice is to let the matter
drop well then on friday after the review i shall expect you
drubetskóy au revoir exclaimed prince andrew and with a bow to them
both he went out

only when prince andrew was gone did rostóv think of what he ought to
have said and he was still more angry at having omitted to say it he
ordered his horse at once and coldly taking leave of borís rode home
should he go to headquarters next day and challenge that affected
adjutant or really let the matter drop was the question that worried
him all the way he thought angrily of the pleasure he would have at
seeing the fright of that small and frail but proud man when covered by
his pistol and then he felt with surprise that of all the men he knew
there was none he would so much like to have for a friend as that very
adjutant whom he so hated





chapter viii

the day after rostóv had been to see borís a review was held of the
austrian and russian troops both those freshly arrived from russia and
those who had been campaigning under kutúzov the two emperors the
russian with his heir the tsarevich and the austrian with the archduke
inspected the allied army of eighty thousand men

from early morning the smart clean troops were on the move forming up
on the field before the fortress now thousands of feet and bayonets
moved and halted at the officers command turned with banners flying
formed up at intervals and wheeled round other similar masses of
infantry in different uniforms now was heard the rhythmic beat of hoofs
and the jingling of showy cavalry in blue red and green braided
uniforms with smartly dressed bandsmen in front mounted on black roan
or gray horses then again spreading out with the brazen clatter of the
polished shining cannon that quivered on the gun carriages and with the
smell of linstocks came the artillery which crawled between the
infantry and cavalry and took up its appointed position not only the
generals in full parade uniforms with their thin or thick waists drawn
in to the utmost their red necks squeezed into their stiff collars and
wearing scarves and all their decorations not only the elegant pomaded
officers but every soldier with his freshly washed and shaven face and
his weapons clean and polished to the utmost and every horse groomed
till its coat shone like satin and every hair of its wetted mane lay
smoothfelt that no small matter was happening but an important and
solemn affair every general and every soldier was conscious of his own
insignificance aware of being but a drop in that ocean of men and yet
at the same time was conscious of his strength as a part of that
enormous whole

from early morning strenuous activities and efforts had begun and by ten
oclock all had been brought into due order the ranks were drawn up on
the vast field the whole army was extended in three lines the cavalry
in front behind it the artillery and behind that again the infantry

a space like a street was left between each two lines of troops the
three parts of that army were sharply distinguished kutúzovs fighting
army with the pávlograds on the right flank of the front those
recently arrived from russia both guards and regiments of the line and
the austrian troops but they all stood in the same lines under one
command and in a like order

like wind over leaves ran an excited whisper theyre coming theyre
coming alarmed voices were heard and a stir of final preparation
swept over all the troops

from the direction of olmutz in front of them a group was seen
approaching and at that moment though the day was still a light gust
of wind blowing over the army slightly stirred the streamers on the
lances and the unfolded standards fluttered against their staffs it
looked as if by that slight motion the army itself was expressing its
joy at the approach of the emperors one voice was heard shouting eyes
front then like the crowing of cocks at sunrise this was repeated by
others from various sides and all became silent

in the deathlike stillness only the tramp of horses was heard this was
the emperors suites the emperors rode up to the flank and the
trumpets of the first cavalry regiment played the general march it
seemed as though not the trumpeters were playing but as if the army
itself rejoicing at the emperors approach had naturally burst into
music amid these sounds only the youthful kindly voice of the emperor
alexander was clearly heard he gave the words of greeting and the
first regiment roared hurrah so deafeningly continuously and
joyfully that the men themselves were awed by their multitude and the
immensity of the power they constituted

rostóv standing in the front lines of kutúzovs army which the tsar
approached first experienced the same feeling as every other man in
that army a feeling of selfforgetfulness a proud consciousness of
might and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this
triumph

he felt that at a single word from that man all this vast mass and he
himself an insignificant atom in it would go through fire and water
commit crime die or perform deeds of highest heroism and so he could
not but tremble and his heart stand still at the imminence of that word

hurrah hurrah hurrah thundered from all sides one regiment after
another greeting the tsar with the strains of the march and then
hurrah then the general march and again hurrah hurrah growing
ever stronger and fuller and merging into a deafening roar

till the tsar reached it each regiment in its silence and immobility
seemed like a lifeless body but as soon as he came up it became alive
its thunder joining the roar of the whole line along which he had
already passed through the terrible and deafening roar of those voices
amid the square masses of troops standing motionless as if turned to
stone hundreds of riders composing the suites moved carelessly but
symmetrically and above all freely and in front of them two menthe
emperors upon them the undivided tensely passionate attention of that
whole mass of men was concentrated

the handsome young emperor alexander in the uniform of the horse
guards wearing a cocked hat with its peaks front and back with his
pleasant face and resonant though not loud voice attracted everyones
attention

rostóv was not far from the trumpeters and with his keen sight had
recognized the tsar and watched his approach when he was within twenty
paces and nicholas could clearly distinguish every detail of his
handsome happy young face he experienced a feeling of tenderness and
ecstasy such as he had never before known every trait and every
movement of the tsars seemed to him enchanting

stopping in front of the pávlograds the tsar said something in french
to the austrian emperor and smiled

seeing that smile rostóv involuntarily smiled himself and felt a still
stronger flow of love for his sovereign he longed to show that love in
some way and knowing that this was impossible was ready to cry the tsar
called the colonel of the regiment and said a few words to him

oh god what would happen to me if the emperor spoke to me thought
rostóv i should die of happiness

the tsar addressed the officers also i thank you all gentlemen i
thank you with my whole heart to rostóv every word sounded like a
voice from heaven how gladly would he have died at once for his tsar

you have earned the st georges standards and will be worthy of them

oh to die to die for him thought rostóv

the tsar said something more which rostóv did not hear and the
soldiers straining their lungs shouted hurrah

rostóv too bending over his saddle shouted hurrah with all his
might feeling that he would like to injure himself by that shout if
only to express his rapture fully

the tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if undecided

how can the emperor be undecided thought rostóv but then even this
indecision appeared to him majestic and enchanting like everything else
the tsar did

that hesitation lasted only an instant the tsars foot in the narrow
pointed boot then fashionable touched the groin of the bobtailed bay
mare he rode his hand in a white glove gathered up the reins and he
moved off accompanied by an irregularly swaying sea of aidesdecamp
farther and farther he rode away stopping at other regiments till at
last only his white plumes were visible to rostóv from amid the suites
that surrounded the emperors

among the gentlemen of the suite rostóv noticed bolkónski sitting his
horse indolently and carelessly rostóv recalled their quarrel of
yesterday and the question presented itself whether he ought or ought
not to challenge bolkónski of course not he now thought is it
worth thinking or speaking of it at such a moment at a time of such
love such rapture and such selfsacrifice what do any of our quarrels
and affronts matter i love and forgive everybody now

when the emperor had passed nearly all the regiments the troops began a
ceremonial march past him and rostóv on bedouin recently purchased
from denisov rode past too at the rear of his squadronthat is alone
and in full view of the emperor

before he reached him rostóv who was a splendid horseman spurred
bedouin twice and successfully put him to the showy trot in which the
animal went when excited bending his foaming muzzle to his chest his
tail extended bedouin as if also conscious of the emperors eye upon
him passed splendidly lifting his feet with a high and graceful
action as if flying through the air without touching the ground

rostóv himself his legs well back and his stomach drawn in and feeling
himself one with his horse rode past the emperor with a frowning but
blissful face like a vewy devil as denisov expressed it

fine fellows the pávlograds remarked the emperor

my god how happy i should be if he ordered me to leap into the fire
this instant thought rostóv

when the review was over the newly arrived officers and also
kutúzovs collected in groups and began to talk about the awards about
the austrians and their uniforms about their lines about bonaparte
and how badly the latter would fare now especially if the essen corps
arrived and prussia took our side

but the talk in every group was chiefly about the emperor alexander his
every word and movement was described with ecstasy

they all had but one wish to advance as soon as possible against the
enemy under the emperors command commanded by the emperor himself they
could not fail to vanquish anyone be it whom it might so thought
rostóv and most of the officers after the review

all were then more confident of victory than the winning of two battles
would have made them





chapter ix

the day after the review borís in his best uniform and with his
comrade bergs best wishes for success rode to olmutz to see bolkónski
wishing to profit by his friendliness and obtain for himself the best
post he couldpreferably that of adjutant to some important personage a
position in the army which seemed to him most attractive it is all
very well for rostóv whose father sends him ten thousand rubles at a
time to talk about not wishing to cringe to anybody and not be anyones
lackey but i who have nothing but my brains have to make a career and
must not miss opportunities but must avail myself of them he
reflected

he did not find prince andrew in olmutz that day but the appearance of
the town where the headquarters and the diplomatic corps were stationed
and the two emperors were living with their suites households and
courts only strengthened his desire to belong to that higher world

he knew no one and despite his smart guardsmans uniform all these
exalted personages passing in the streets in their elegant carriages
with their plumes ribbons and medals both courtiers and military men
seemed so immeasurably above him an insignificant officer of the
guards that they not only did not wish to but simply could not be
aware of his existence at the quarters of the commanderinchief
kutúzov where he inquired for bolkónski all the adjutants and even the
orderlies looked at him as if they wished to impress on him that a great
many officers like him were always coming there and that everybody was
heartily sick of them in spite of this or rather because of it next
day november  after dinner he again went to olmutz and entering the
house occupied by kutúzov asked for bolkónski prince andrew was in and
borís was shown into a large hall probably formerly used for dancing
but in which five beds now stood and furniture of various kinds a
table chairs and a clavichord one adjutant nearest the door was
sitting at the table in a persian dressing gown writing another the
red stout nesvitski lay on a bed with his arms under his head
laughing with an officer who had sat down beside him a third was
playing a viennese waltz on the clavichord while a fourth lying on the
clavichord sang the tune bolkónski was not there none of these
gentlemen changed his position on seeing borís the one who was writing
and whom borís addressed turned round crossly and told him bolkónski was
on duty and that he should go through the door on the left into the
reception room if he wished to see him borís thanked him and went to
the reception room where he found some ten officers and generals

when he entered prince andrew his eyes drooping contemptuously with
that peculiar expression of polite weariness which plainly says if it
were not my duty i would not talk to you for a moment was listening
to an old russian general with decorations who stood very erect almost
on tiptoe with a soldiers obsequious expression on his purple face
reporting something

very well then be so good as to wait said prince andrew to the
general in russian speaking with the french intonation he affected
when he wished to speak contemptuously and noticing borís prince
andrew paying no more heed to the general who ran after him imploring
him to hear something more nodded and turned to him with a cheerful
smile

at that moment borís clearly realized what he had before surmised that
in the army besides the subordination and discipline prescribed in the
military code which he and the others knew in the regiment there was
another more important subordination which made this tightlaced
purplefaced general wait respectfully while captain prince andrew for
his own pleasure chose to chat with lieutenant drubetskóy more than
ever was borís resolved to serve in future not according to the written
code but under this unwritten law he felt now that merely by having
been recommended to prince andrew he had already risen above the general
who at the front had the power to annihilate him a lieutenant of the
guards prince andrew came up to him and took his hand

i am very sorry you did not find me in yesterday i was fussing about
with germans all day we went with weyrother to survey the dispositions
when germans start being accurate theres no end to it

borís smiled as if he understood what prince andrew was alluding to as
something generally known but it was the first time he had heard
weyrothers name or even the term dispositions

well my dear fellow so you still want to be an adjutant i have been
thinking about you

yes i was thinkingfor some reason borís could not help blushingof
asking the commanderinchief he has had a letter from prince kurágin
about me i only wanted to ask because i fear the guards wont be in
action he added as if in apology

all right all right well talk it over replied prince andrew only
let me report this gentlemans business and i shall be at your
disposal

while prince andrew went to report about the purplefaced general that
gentlemanevidently not sharing borís conception of the advantages of
the unwritten code of subordinationlooked so fixedly at the
presumptuous lieutenant who had prevented his finishing what he had to
say to the adjutant that borís felt uncomfortable he turned away and
waited impatiently for prince andrews return from the commanderin
chiefs room

you see my dear fellow i have been thinking about you said prince
andrew when they had gone into the large room where the clavichord was
its no use your going to the commanderinchief he would say a lot of
pleasant things ask you to dinner that would not be bad as regards
the unwritten code thought borís but nothing more would come of it
there will soon be a battalion of us aidesdecamp and adjutants but
this is what well do i have a good friend an adjutant general and an
excellent fellow prince dolgorukov and though you may not know it the
fact is that now kutúzov with his staff and all of us count for nothing
everything is now centered round the emperor so we will go to
dolgorukov i have to go there anyhow and i have already spoken to him
about you we shall see whether he cannot attach you to himself or find
a place for you somewhere nearer the sun

prince andrew always became specially keen when he had to guide a young
man and help him to worldly success under cover of obtaining help of
this kind for another which from pride he would never accept for
himself he kept in touch with the circle which confers success and
which attracted him he very readily took up borís cause and went with
him to dolgorukov

it was late in the evening when they entered the palace at olmutz
occupied by the emperors and their retinues

that same day a council of war had been held in which all the members of
the hofkriegsrath and both emperors took part at that council contrary
to the views of the old generals kutúzov and prince schwartzenberg it
had been decided to advance immediately and give battle to bonaparte
the council of war was just over when prince andrew accompanied by borís
arrived at the palace to find dolgorukov everyone at headquarters was
still under the spell of the days council at which the party of the
young had triumphed the voices of those who counseled delay and advised
waiting for something else before advancing had been so completely
silenced and their arguments confuted by such conclusive evidence of the
advantages of attacking that what had been discussed at the councilthe
coming battle and the victory that would certainly result from itno
longer seemed to be in the future but in the past all the advantages
were on our side our enormous forces undoubtedly superior to
napoleons were concentrated in one place the troops inspired by the
emperors presence were eager for action the strategic position where
the operations would take place was familiar in all its details to the
austrian general weyrother a lucky accident had ordained that the
austrian army should maneuver the previous year on the very fields where
the french had now to be fought the adjacent locality was known and
shown in every detail on the maps and bonaparte evidently weakened
was undertaking nothing

dolgorukov one of the warmest advocates of an attack had just returned
from the council tired and exhausted but eager and proud of the victory
that had been gained prince andrew introduced his protege but prince
dolgorukov politely and firmly pressing his hand said nothing to borís
and evidently unable to suppress the thoughts which were uppermost in
his mind at that moment addressed prince andrew in french

ah my dear fellow what a battle we have gained god grant that the
one that will result from it will be as victorious however dear
fellow he said abruptly and eagerly i must confess to having been
unjust to the austrians and especially to weyrother what exactitude
what minuteness what knowledge of the locality what foresight for
every eventuality every possibility even to the smallest detail no my
dear fellow no conditions better than our present ones could have been
devised this combination of austrian precision with russian valorwhat
more could be wished for

so the attack is definitely resolved on asked bolkónski

and do you know my dear fellow it seems to me that bonaparte has
decidedly lost bearings you know that a letter was received from him
today for the emperor dolgorukov smiled significantly

is that so and what did he say inquired bolkónski

what can he say tradiridira and so on merely to gain time i
tell you he is in our hands thats certain but what was most amusing
he continued with a sudden goodnatured laugh was that we could not
think how to address the reply if not as consul and of course not as
emperor it seemed to me it should be to general bonaparte

but between not recognizing him as emperor and calling him general
bonaparte there is a difference remarked bolkónski

thats just it interrupted dolgorukov quickly laughing you know
bilibinhes a very clever fellow he suggested addressing him as
usurper and enemy of mankind

dolgorukov laughed merrily

only that said bolkónski

all the same it was bilibin who found a suitable form for the address
he is a wise and clever fellow

what was it

to the head of the french government au chef du gouvernement
francais said dolgorukov with grave satisfaction good wasnt it

yes but he will dislike it extremely said bolkónski

oh yes very much my brother knows him hes dined with himthe
present emperormore than once in paris and tells me he never met a
more cunning or subtle diplomatistyou know a combination of french
adroitness and italian playacting do you know the tale about him and
count markov count markov was the only man who knew how to handle him
you know the story of the handkerchief it is delightful

and the talkative dolgorukov turning now to borís now to prince
andrew told how bonaparte wishing to test markov our ambassador
purposely dropped a handkerchief in front of him and stood looking at
markov probably expecting markov to pick it up for him and how markov
immediately dropped his own beside it and picked it up without touching
bonapartes

delightful said bolkónski but i have come to you prince as a
petitioner on behalf of this young man you see but before prince
andrew could finish an aidedecamp came in to summon dolgorukov to the
emperor

oh what a nuisance said dolgorukov getting up hurriedly and
pressing the hands of prince andrew and borís you know i should be
very glad to do all in my power both for you and for this dear young
man again he pressed the hand of the latter with an expression of
goodnatured sincere and animated levity but you see another
time

borís was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher powers
as he felt himself to be at that moment he was conscious that here he
was in contact with the springs that set in motion the enormous
movements of the mass of which in his regiment he felt himself a tiny
obedient and insignificant atom they followed prince dolgorukov out
into the corridor and metcoming out of the door of the emperors room
by which dolgorukov had entereda short man in civilian clothes with a
clever face and sharply projecting jaw which without spoiling his face
gave him a peculiar vivacity and shiftiness of expression this short
man nodded to dolgorukov as to an intimate friend and stared at prince
andrew with cool intensity walking straight toward him and evidently
expecting him to bow or to step out of his way prince andrew did
neither a look of animosity appeared on his face and the other turned
away and went down the side of the corridor

who was that asked borís

he is one of the most remarkable but to me most unpleasant of menthe
minister of foreign affairs prince adam czartoryski it is such men
as he who decide the fate of nations added bolkónski with a sigh he
could not suppress as they passed out of the palace

next day the army began its campaign and up to the very battle of
austerlitz borís was unable to see either prince andrew or dolgorukov
again and remained for a while with the ismaylov regiment





chapter x

at dawn on the sixteenth of november denisovs squadron in which
nicholas rostóv served and which was in prince bagrations detachment
moved from the place where it had spent the night advancing into action
as arranged and after going behind other columns for about two thirds
of a mile was stopped on the highroad rostóv saw the cossacks and then
the first and second squadrons of hussars and infantry battalions and
artillery pass by and go forward and then generals bagration and
dolgorukov ride past with their adjutants all the fear before action
which he had experienced as previously all the inner struggle to
conquer that fear all his dreams of distinguishing himself as a true
hussar in this battle had been wasted their squadron remained in
reserve and nicholas rostóv spent that day in a dull and wretched mood
at nine in the morning he heard firing in front and shouts of hurrah
and saw wounded being brought back there were not many of them and at
last he saw how a whole detachment of french cavalry was brought in
convoyed by a sotnya of cossacks evidently the affair was over and
though not big had been a successful engagement the men and officers
returning spoke of a brilliant victory of the occupation of the town of
wischau and the capture of a whole french squadron the day was bright
and sunny after a sharp night frost and the cheerful glitter of that
autumn day was in keeping with the news of victory which was conveyed
not only by the tales of those who had taken part in it but also by the
joyful expression on the faces of soldiers officers generals and
adjutants as they passed rostóv going or coming and nicholas who had
vainly suffered all the dread that precedes a battle and had spent that
happy day in inactivity was all the more depressed

come here wostov lets dwink to dwown our gwief shouted denisov
who had settled down by the roadside with a flask and some food

the officers gathered round denisovs canteen eating and talking

there they are bringing another cried one of the officers
indicating a captive french dragoon who was being brought in on foot by
two cossacks

one of them was leading by the bridle a fine large french horse he had
taken from the prisoner

sell us that horse denisov called out to the cossacks

if you like your honor

the officers got up and stood round the cossacks and their prisoner the
french dragoon was a young alsatian who spoke french with a german
accent he was breathless with agitation his face was red and when he
heard some french spoken he at once began speaking to the officers
addressing first one then another he said he would not have been
taken it was not his fault but the corporals who had sent him to seize
some horsecloths though he had told him the russians were there and at
every word he added but dont hurt my little horse and stroked the
animal it was plain that he did not quite grasp where he was now he
excused himself for having been taken prisoner and now imagining
himself before his own officers insisted on his soldierly discipline
and zeal in the service he brought with him into our rearguard all the
freshness of atmosphere of the french army which was so alien to us

the cossacks sold the horse for two gold pieces and rostóv being the
richest of the officers now that he had received his money bought it

but dont hurt my little horse said the alsatian goodnaturedly to
rostóv when the animal was handed over to the hussar

rostóv smilingly reassured the dragoon and gave him money

alley alley said the cossack touching the prisoners arm to make
him go on

the emperor the emperor was suddenly heard among the hussars

all began to run and bustle and rostóv saw coming up the road behind
him several riders with white plumes in their hats in a moment everyone
was in his place waiting

rostóv did not know or remember how he ran to his place and mounted
instantly his regret at not having been in action and his dejected mood
amid people of whom he was weary had gone instantly every thought of
himself had vanished he was filled with happiness at his nearness to
the emperor he felt that this nearness by itself made up to him for the
day he had lost he was happy as a lover when the longedfor moment of
meeting arrives not daring to look round and without looking round he
was ecstatically conscious of his approach he felt it not only from the
sound of the hoofs of the approaching cavalcade but because as he drew
near everything grew brighter more joyful more significant and more
festive around him nearer and nearer to rostóv came that sun shedding
beams of mild and majestic light around and already he felt himself
enveloped in those beams he heard his voice that kindly calm and
majestic voice that was yet so simple and as if in accord with rostóvs
feeling there was a deathly stillness amid which was heard the
emperors voice

the pávlograd hussars he inquired

the reserves sire replied a voice a very human one compared to that
which had said the pávlograd hussars

the emperor drew level with rostóv and halted alexanders face was even
more beautiful than it had been three days before at the review it
shone with such gaiety and youth such innocent youth that it suggested
the liveliness of a fourteenyearold boy and yet it was the face of
the majestic emperor casually while surveying the squadron the
emperors eyes met rostóvs and rested on them for not more than two
seconds whether or no the emperor understood what was going on in
rostóvs soul it seemed to rostóv that he understood everything at
any rate his lightblue eyes gazed for about two seconds into rostóvs
face a gentle mild light poured from them then all at once he raised
his eyebrows abruptly touched his horse with his left foot and
galloped on

the younger emperor could not restrain his wish to be present at the
battle and in spite of the remonstrances of his courtiers at twelve
oclock left the third column with which he had been and galloped toward
the vanguard before he came up with the hussars several adjutants met
him with news of the successful result of the action

this battle which consisted in the capture of a french squadron was
represented as a brilliant victory over the french and so the emperor
and the whole army especially while the smoke hung over the
battlefield believed that the french had been defeated and were
retreating against their will a few minutes after the emperor had
passed the pávlograd division was ordered to advance in wischau
itself a petty german town rostóv saw the emperor again in the market
place where there had been some rather heavy firing before the
emperors arrival lay several killed and wounded soldiers whom there
had not been time to move the emperor surrounded by his suite of
officers and courtiers was riding a bobtailed chestnut mare a
different one from that which he had ridden at the review and bending
to one side he gracefully held a gold lorgnette to his eyes and looked
at a soldier who lay prone with blood on his uncovered head the
wounded soldier was so dirty coarse and revolting that his proximity
to the emperor shocked rostóv rostóv saw how the emperors rather round
shoulders shuddered as if a cold shiver had run down them how his left
foot began convulsively tapping the horses side with the spur and how
the welltrained horse looked round unconcerned and did not stir an
adjutant dismounting lifted the soldier under the arms to place him on
a stretcher that had been brought the soldier groaned

gently gently cant you do it more gently said the emperor
apparently suffering more than the dying soldier and he rode away

rostóv saw tears filling the emperors eyes and heard him as he was
riding away say to czartoryski what a terrible thing war is what a
terrible thing quelle terrible chose que la guerre

the troops of the vanguard were stationed before wischau within sight
of the enemys lines which all day long had yielded ground to us at the
least firing the emperors gratitude was announced to the vanguard
rewards were promised and the men received a double ration of vodka
the campfires crackled and the soldiers songs resounded even more
merrily than on the previous night denisov celebrated his promotion to
the rank of major and rostóv who had already drunk enough at the end
of the feast proposed the emperors health not our sovereign the
emperor as they say at official dinners said he but the health of
our sovereign that good enchanting and great man let us drink to his
health and to the certain defeat of the french

if we fought before he said not letting the french pass as at
schon grabern what shall we not do now when he is at the front we will
all die for him gladly is it not so gentlemen perhaps i am not saying
it right i have drunk a good dealbut that is how i feel and so do you
too to the health of alexander the first hurrah

hurrah rang the enthusiastic voices of the officers

and the old cavalry captain kirsten shouted enthusiastically and no
less sincerely than the twentyyearold rostóv

when the officers had emptied and smashed their glasses kirsten filled
others and in shirt sleeves and breeches went glass in hand to the
soldiers bonfires and with his long gray mustache his white chest
showing under his open shirt he stood in a majestic pose in the light
of the campfire waving his uplifted arm

lads heres to our sovereign the emperor and victory over our
enemies hurrah he exclaimed in his dashing old hussars baritone

the hussars crowded round and responded heartily with loud shouts

late that night when all had separated denisov with his short hand
patted his favorite rostóv on the shoulder

as theres no one to fall in love with on campaign hes fallen in love
with the tsar he said

denisov dont make fun of it cried rostóv it is such a lofty
beautiful feeling such a

i believe it i believe it fwiend and i share and appwove

no you dont understand

and rostóv got up and went wandering among the campfires dreaming of
what happiness it would be to dienot in saving the emperors life he
did not even dare to dream of that but simply to die before his eyes
he really was in love with the tsar and the glory of the russian arms
and the hope of future triumph and he was not the only man to
experience that feeling during those memorable days preceding the battle
of austerlitz nine tenths of the men in the russian army were then in
love though less ecstatically with their tsar and the glory of the
russian arms





chapter xi

the next day the emperor stopped at wischau and villier his physician
was repeatedly summoned to see him at headquarters and among the troops
near by the news spread that the emperor was unwell he ate nothing and
had slept badly that night those around him reported the cause of this
indisposition was the strong impression made on his sensitive mind by
the sight of the killed and wounded

at daybreak on the seventeenth a french officer who had come with a
flag of truce demanding an audience with the russian emperor was
brought into wischau from our outposts this officer was savary the
emperor had only just fallen asleep and so savary had to wait at midday
he was admitted to the emperor and an hour later he rode off with
prince dolgorukov to the advanced post of the french army

it was rumored that savary had been sent to propose to alexander a
meeting with napoleon to the joy and pride of the whole army a
personal interview was refused and instead of the sovereign prince
dolgorukov the victor at wischau was sent with savary to negotiate
with napoleon if contrary to expectations these negotiations were
actuated by a real desire for peace

toward evening dolgorukov came back went straight to the tsar and
remained alone with him for a long time

on the eighteenth and nineteenth of november the army advanced two
days march and the enemys outposts after a brief interchange of shots
retreated in the highest army circles from midday on the nineteenth a
great excitedly bustling activity began which lasted till the morning
of the twentieth when the memorable battle of austerlitz was fought

till midday on the nineteenth the activitythe eager talk running to
and fro and dispatching of adjutantswas confined to the emperors
headquarters but on the afternoon of that day this activity reached
kutúzovs headquarters and the staffs of the commanders of columns by
evening the adjutants had spread it to all ends and parts of the army
and in the night from the nineteenth to the twentieth the whole eighty
thousand allied troops rose from their bivouacs to the hum of voices
and the army swayed and started in one enormous mass six miles long

the concentrated activity which had begun at the emperors headquarters
in the morning and had started the whole movement that followed was like
the first movement of the main wheel of a large tower clock one wheel
slowly moved another was set in motion and a third and wheels began
to revolve faster and faster levers and cogwheels to work chimes to
play figures to pop out and the hands to advance with regular motion
as a result of all that activity

just as in the mechanism of a clock so in the mechanism of the military
machine an impulse once given leads to the final result and just as
indifferently quiescent till the moment when motion is transmitted to
them are the parts of the mechanism which the impulse has not yet
reached wheels creak on their axles as the cogs engage one another and
the revolving pulleys whirr with the rapidity of their movement but a
neighboring wheel is as quiet and motionless as though it were prepared
to remain so for a hundred years but the moment comes when the lever
catches it and obeying the impulse that wheel begins to creak and joins
in the common motion the result and aim of which are beyond its ken

just as in a clock the result of the complicated motion of innumerable
wheels and pulleys is merely a slow and regular movement of the hands
which show the time so the result of all the complicated human
activities of  russians and frenchall their passions desires
remorse humiliations sufferings outbursts of pride fear and
enthusiasmwas only the loss of the battle of austerlitz the socalled
battle of the three emperorsthat is to say a slow movement of the hand
on the dial of human history

prince andrew was on duty that day and in constant attendance on the
commanderinchief

at six in the evening kutúzov went to the emperors headquarters and
after staying but a short time with the tsar went to see the grand
marshal of the court count tolstóy

bolkónski took the opportunity to go in to get some details of the
coming action from dolgorukov he felt that kutúzov was upset and
dissatisfied about something and that at headquarters they were
dissatisfied with him and also that at the emperors headquarters
everyone adopted toward him the tone of men who know something others do
not know he therefore wished to speak to dolgorukov

well how dyou do my dear fellow said dolgorukov who was sitting
at tea with bilibin the fete is for tomorrow how is your old fellow
out of sorts

i wont say he is out of sorts but i fancy he would like to be heard

but they heard him at the council of war and will hear him when he
talks sense but to temporize and wait for something now when bonaparte
fears nothing so much as a general battle is impossible

yes you have seen him said prince andrew well what is bonaparte
like how did he impress you

yes i saw him and am convinced that he fears nothing so much as a
general engagement repeated dolgorukov evidently prizing this general
conclusion which he had arrived at from his interview with napoleon if
he werent afraid of a battle why did he ask for that interview why
negotiate and above all why retreat when to retreat is so contrary to
his method of conducting war believe me he is afraid afraid of a
general battle his hour has come mark my words

but tell me what is he like eh said prince andrew again

he is a man in a gray overcoat very anxious that i should call him
your majesty but who to his chagrin got no title from me thats
the sort of man he is and nothing more replied dolgorukov looking
round at bilibin with a smile

despite my great respect for old kutúzov he continued we should be
a nice set of fellows if we were to wait about and so give him a chance
to escape or to trick us now that we certainly have him in our hands
no we mustnt forget suvórov and his rulenot to put yourself in a
position to be attacked but yourself to attack believe me in war the
energy of young men often shows the way better than all the experience
of old cunctators

but in what position are we going to attack him i have been at the
outposts today and it is impossible to say where his chief forces are
situated said prince andrew

he wished to explain to dolgorukov a plan of attack he had himself
formed

oh that is all the same dolgorukov said quickly and getting up he
spread a map on the table all eventualities have been foreseen if he
is standing before brunn

and prince dolgorukov rapidly but indistinctly explained weyrothers
plan of a flanking movement

prince andrew began to reply and to state his own plan which might have
been as good as weyrothers but for the disadvantage that weyrothers
had already been approved as soon as prince andrew began to demonstrate
the defects of the latter and the merits of his own plan prince
dolgorukov ceased to listen to him and gazed absentmindedly not at the
map but at prince andrews face

there will be a council of war at kutúzovs tonight though you can
say all this there remarked dolgorukov

i will do so said prince andrew moving away from the map

whatever are you bothering about gentlemen said bilibin who till
then had listened with an amused smile to their conversation and now
was evidently ready with a joke whether tomorrow brings victory or
defeat the glory of our russian arms is secure except your kutúzov
there is not a single russian in command of a column the commanders
are herr general wimpfen le comte de langeron le prince de
lichtenstein le prince de hohenlohe and finally prishprish and so on
like all those polish names

be quiet backbiter said dolgorukov it is not true there are now
two russians miloradovich and dokhturov and there would be a third
count arakcheev if his nerves were not too weak

however i think general kutúzov has come out said prince andrew i
wish you good luck and success gentlemen he added and went out after
shaking hands with dolgorukov and bilibin

on the way home prince andrew could not refrain from asking kutúzov
who was sitting silently beside him what he thought of tomorrows
battle

kutúzov looked sternly at his adjutant and after a pause replied i
think the battle will be lost and so i told count tolstóy and asked him
to tell the emperor what do you think he replied but my dear
general i am engaged with rice and cutlets look after military matters
yourself yes that was the answer i got





chapter xii

shortly after nine oclock that evening weyrother drove with his plans
to kutúzovs quarters where the council of war was to be held all the
commanders of columns were summoned to the commanderinchiefs and with
the exception of prince bagration who declined to come were all there
at the appointed time

weyrother who was in full control of the proposed battle by his
eagerness and briskness presented a marked contrast to the dissatisfied
and drowsy kutúzov who reluctantly played the part of chairman and
president of the council of war weyrother evidently felt himself to be
at the head of a movement that had already become unrestrainable he was
like a horse running downhill harnessed to a heavy cart whether he was
pulling it or being pushed by it he did not know but rushed along at
headlong speed with no time to consider what this movement might lead
to weyrother had been twice that evening to the enemys picket line to
reconnoiter personally and twice to the emperors russian and austrian
to report and explain and to his headquarters where he had dictated the
dispositions in german and now much exhausted he arrived at
kutúzovs

he was evidently so busy that he even forgot to be polite to the
commander in chief he interrupted him talked rapidly and indistinctly
without looking at the man he was addressing and did not reply to
questions put to him he was bespattered with mud and had a pitiful
weary and distracted air though at the same time he was haughty and
selfconfident

kutúzov was occupying a noblemans castle of modest dimensions near
ostralitz in the large drawing room which had become the commander in
chiefs office were gathered kutúzov himself weyrother and the members
of the council of war they were drinking tea and only awaited prince
bagration to begin the council at last bagrations orderly came with
the news that the prince could not attend prince andrew came in to
inform the commanderinchief of this and availing himself of
permission previously given him by kutúzov to be present at the council
he remained in the room

since prince bagration is not coming we may begin said weyrother
hurriedly rising from his seat and going up to the table on which an
enormous map of the environs of brunn was spread out

kutúzov with his uniform unbuttoned so that his fat neck bulged over
his collar as if escaping was sitting almost asleep in a low chair
with his podgy old hands resting symmetrically on its arms at the sound
of weyrothers voice he opened his one eye with an effort

yes yes if you please it is already late said he and nodding his
head he let it droop and again closed his eye

if at first the members of the council thought that kutúzov was
pretending to sleep the sounds his nose emitted during the reading that
followed proved that the commanderinchief at that moment was absorbed
by a far more serious matter than a desire to show his contempt for the
dispositions or anything elsehe was engaged in satisfying the
irresistible human need for sleep he really was asleep weyrother with
the gesture of a man too busy to lose a moment glanced at kutúzov and
having convinced himself that he was asleep took up a paper and in a
loud monotonous voice began to read out the dispositions for the
impending battle under a heading which he also read out

dispositions for an attack on the enemy position behind kobelnitz and
sokolnitz november

the dispositions were very complicated and difficult they began as
follows

as the enemys left wing rests on wooded hills and his right extends
along kobelnitz and sokolnitz behind the ponds that are there while we
on the other hand with our left wing by far outflank his right it is
advantageous to attack the enemys latter wing especially if we occupy
the villages of sokolnitz and kobelnitz whereby we can both fall on his
flank and pursue him over the plain between schlappanitz and the
thuerassa forest avoiding the defiles of schlappanitz and bellowitz
which cover the enemys front for this object it is necessary that
the first column marches the second column marches the third
column marches and so on read weyrother

the generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult dispositions
the tall fairhaired general buxhowden stood leaning his back against
the wall his eyes fixed on a burning candle and seemed not to listen
or even to wish to be thought to listen exactly opposite weyrother
with his glistening wideopen eyes fixed upon him and his mustache
twisted upwards sat the ruddy miloradovich in a military pose his
elbows turned outwards his hands on his knees and his shoulders
raised he remained stubbornly silent gazing at weyrothers face and
only turned away his eyes when the austrian chief of staff finished
reading then miloradovich looked round significantly at the other
generals but one could not tell from that significant look whether he
agreed or disagreed and was satisfied or not with the arrangements next
to weyrother sat count langeron who with a subtle smile that never left
his typically southern french face during the whole time of the reading
gazed at his delicate fingers which rapidly twirled by its corners a
gold snuffbox on which was a portrait in the middle of one of the
longest sentences he stopped the rotary motion of the snuffbox raised
his head and with inimical politeness lurking in the corners of his
thin lips interrupted weyrother wishing to say something but the
austrian general continuing to read frowned angrily and jerked his
elbows as if to say you can tell me your views later but now be so
good as to look at the map and listen langeron lifted his eyes with an
expression of perplexity turned round to miloradovich as if seeking an
explanation but meeting the latters impressive but meaningless gaze
drooped his eyes sadly and again took to twirling his snuffbox

a geography lesson he muttered as if to himself but loud enough to
be heard

przebyszewski with respectful but dignified politeness held his hand
to his ear toward weyrother with the air of a man absorbed in
attention dohkturov a little man sat opposite weyrother with an
assiduous and modest mien and stooping over the outspread map
conscientiously studied the dispositions and the unfamiliar locality he
asked weyrother several times to repeat words he had not clearly heard
and the difficult names of villages weyrother complied and dohkturov
noted them down

when the reading which lasted more than an hour was over langeron again
brought his snuffbox to rest and without looking at weyrother or at
anyone in particular began to say how difficult it was to carry out
such a plan in which the enemys position was assumed to be known
whereas it was perhaps not known since the enemy was in movement
langerons objections were valid but it was obvious that their chief aim
was to show general weyrotherwho had read his dispositions with as much
selfconfidence as if he were addressing school childrenthat he had to
do not with fools but with men who could teach him something in
military matters

when the monotonous sound of weyrothers voice ceased kutúzov opened
his eye as a miller wakes up when the soporific drone of the mill wheel
is interrupted he listened to what langeron said as if remarking so
you are still at that silly business quickly closed his eye again and
let his head sink still lower

langeron trying as virulently as possible to sting weyrothers vanity
as author of the military plan argued that bonaparte might easily
attack instead of being attacked and so render the whole of this plan
perfectly worthless weyrother met all objections with a firm and
contemptuous smile evidently prepared beforehand to meet all objections
be they what they might

if he could attack us he would have done so today said he

so you think he is powerless said langeron

he has forty thousand men at most replied weyrother with the smile
of a doctor to whom an old wife wishes to explain the treatment of a
case

in that case he is inviting his doom by awaiting our attack said
langeron with a subtly ironical smile again glancing round for support
to miloradovich who was near him

but miloradovich was at that moment evidently thinking of anything
rather than of what the generals were disputing about

ma foi said he tomorrow we shall see all that on the battlefield

weyrother again gave that smile which seemed to say that to him it was
strange and ridiculous to meet objections from russian generals and to
have to prove to them what he had not merely convinced himself of but
had also convinced the sovereign emperors of

the enemy has quenched his fires and a continual noise is heard from
his camp said he what does that mean either he is retreating which
is the only thing we need fear or he is changing his position he
smiled ironically but even if he also took up a position in the
thuerassa he merely saves us a great deal of trouble and all our
arrangements to the minutest detail remain the same

how is that began prince andrew who had for long been waiting an
opportunity to express his doubts

kutúzov here woke up coughed heavily and looked round at the generals

gentlemen the dispositions for tomorrowor rather for today for it is
past midnightcannot now be altered said he you have heard them and
we shall all do our duty but before a battle there is nothing more
important he paused than to have a good sleep

he moved as if to rise the generals bowed and retired it was past
midnight prince andrew went out

the council of war at which prince andrew had not been able to express
his opinion as he had hoped to left on him a vague and uneasy
impression whether dolgorukov and weyrother or kutúzov langeron and
the others who did not approve of the plan of attack were righthe did
not know but was it really not possible for kutúzov to state his views
plainly to the emperor is it possible that on account of court and
personal considerations tens of thousands of lives and my life my
life he thought must be risked

yes it is very likely that i shall be killed tomorrow he thought
and suddenly at this thought of death a whole series of most distant
most intimate memories rose in his imagination he remembered his last
parting from his father and his wife he remembered the days when he
first loved her he thought of her pregnancy and felt sorry for her and
for himself and in a nervously emotional and softened mood he went out
of the hut in which he was billeted with nesvitski and began to walk up
and down before it

the night was foggy and through the fog the moonlight gleamed
mysteriously yes tomorrow tomorrow he thought tomorrow
everything may be over for me all these memories will be no more none
of them will have any meaning for me tomorrow perhaps even certainly
i have a presentiment that for the first time i shall have to show all i
can do and his fancy pictured the battle its loss the concentration
of fighting at one point and the hesitation of all the commanders and
then that happy moment that toulon for which he had so long waited
presents itself to him at last he firmly and clearly expresses his
opinion to kutúzov to weyrother and to the emperors all are struck by
the justness of his views but no one undertakes to carry them out so
he takes a regiment a divisionstipulates that no one is to interfere
with his arrangementsleads his division to the decisive point and
gains the victory alone but death and suffering suggested another
voice prince andrew however did not answer that voice and went on
dreaming of his triumphs the dispositions for the next battle are
planned by him alone nominally he is only an adjutant on kutúzovs
staff but he does everything alone the next battle is won by him
alone kutúzov is removed and he is appointed well and then asked
the other voice if before that you are not ten times wounded killed
or betrayed well what then well then prince andrew answered
himself i dont know what will happen and dont want to know and
cant but if i want thiswant glory want to be known to men want to
be loved by them it is not my fault that i want it and want nothing but
that and live only for that yes for that alone i shall never tell
anyone but oh god what am i to do if i love nothing but fame and
mens esteem death wounds the loss of familyi fear nothing and
precious and dear as many persons are to mefather sister wifethose
dearest to meyet dreadful and unnatural as it seems i would give them
all at once for a moment of glory of triumph over men of love from men
i dont know and never shall know for the love of these men here he
thought as he listened to voices in kutúzovs courtyard the voices
were those of the orderlies who were packing up one voice probably a
coachmans was teasing kutúzovs old cook whom prince andrew knew and
who was called tit he was saying tit i say tit

well returned the old man

go tit thresh a bit said the wag

oh go to the devil called out a voice drowned by the laughter of
the orderlies and servants

all the same i love and value nothing but triumph over them all i
value this mystic power and glory that is floating here above me in this
mist





chapter xiii

that same night rostóv was with a platoon on skirmishing duty in front
of bagrations detachment his hussars were placed along the line in
couples and he himself rode along the line trying to master the
sleepiness that kept coming over him an enormous space with our armys
campfires dimly glowing in the fog could be seen behind him in front
of him was misty darkness rostóv could see nothing peer as he would
into that foggy distance now something gleamed gray now there was
something black now little lights seemed to glimmer where the enemy
ought to be now he fancied it was only something in his own eyes his
eyes kept closing and in his fancy appearednow the emperor now
denisov and now moscow memoriesand he again hurriedly opened his eyes
and saw close before him the head and ears of the horse he was riding
and sometimes when he came within six paces of them the black figures
of hussars but in the distance was still the same misty darkness why
not it might easily happen thought rostóv that the emperor will
meet me and give me an order as he would to any other officer hell
say go and find out whats there there are many stories of his
getting to know an officer in just such a chance way and attaching him
to himself what if he gave me a place near him oh how i would guard
him how i would tell him the truth how i would unmask his deceivers
and in order to realize vividly his love devotion to the sovereign
rostóv pictured to himself an enemy or a deceitful german whom he would
not only kill with pleasure but whom he would slap in the face before
the emperor suddenly a distant shout aroused him he started and opened
his eyes

where am i oh yes in the skirmishing line pass and
watchwordshaft olmutz what a nuisance that our squadron will be in
reserve tomorrow he thought ill ask leave to go to the front this
may be my only chance of seeing the emperor it wont be long now before
i am off duty ill take another turn and when i get back ill go to the
general and ask him he readjusted himself in the saddle and touched up
his horse to ride once more round his hussars it seemed to him that it
was getting lighter to the left he saw a sloping descent lit up and
facing it a black knoll that seemed as steep as a wall on this knoll
there was a white patch that rostóv could not at all make out was it a
glade in the wood lit up by the moon or some unmelted snow or some
white houses he even thought something moved on that white spot i
expect its snow that spot a spotune tache he thought there
now its not a tache natásha sister black eyes na
tasha wont she be surprised when i tell her how ive seen the
emperor natásha take my sabretachekeep to the right your
honor there are bushes here came the voice of an hussar past whom
rostóv was riding in the act of falling asleep rostóv lifted his head
that had sunk almost to his horses mane and pulled up beside the
hussar he was succumbing to irresistible youthful childish
drowsiness but what was i thinking i mustnt forget how shall i
speak to the emperor no thats not itthats tomorrow oh yes
natásha sabretache saber them whom the hussars ah the
hussars with mustaches along the tverskaya street rode the hussar with
mustaches i thought about him too just opposite guryevs house
old guryev oh but denisovs a fine fellow but thats all nonsense
the chief thing is that the emperor is here how he looked at me and
wished to say something but dared not no it was i who dared not
but thats nonsense the chief thing is not to forget the important
thing i was thinking of yes natasha sabretache oh yes yes thats
right and his head once more sank to his horses neck all at once it
seemed to him that he was being fired at what what what cut them
down what said rostóv waking up at the moment he opened his eyes
he heard in front of him where the enemy was the longdrawn shouts of
thousands of voices his horse and the horse of the hussar near him
pricked their ears at these shouts over there where the shouting came
from a fire flared up and went out again then another and all along
the french line on the hill fires flared up and the shouting grew louder
and louder rostóv could hear the sound of french words but could not
distinguish them the din of many voices was too great all he could
hear was ahahah and rrrr

whats that what do you make of it said rostóv to the hussar beside
him that must be the enemys camp

the hussar did not reply

why dont you hear it rostóv asked again after waiting for a reply

who can tell your honor replied the hussar reluctantly

from the direction it must be the enemy repeated rostóv

it may be he or it may be nothing muttered the hussar its dark
steady he cried to his fidgeting horse

rostóvs horse was also getting restive it pawed the frozen ground
pricking its ears at the noise and looking at the lights the shouting
grew still louder and merged into a general roar that only an army of
several thousand men could produce the lights spread farther and
farther probably along the line of the french camp rostóv no longer
wanted to sleep the gay triumphant shouting of the enemy army had a
stimulating effect on him vive lempereur lempereur he now heard
distinctly

they cant be far off probably just beyond the stream he said to the
hussar beside him

the hussar only sighed without replying and coughed angrily the sound
of horses hoofs approaching at a trot along the line of hussars was
heard and out of the foggy darkness the figure of a sergeant of hussars
suddenly appeared looming huge as an elephant

your honor the generals said the sergeant riding up to rostóv

rostóv still looking round toward the fires and the shouts rode with
the sergeant to meet some mounted men who were riding along the line
one was on a white horse prince bagration and prince dolgorukov with
their adjutants had come to witness the curious phenomenon of the lights
and shouts in the enemys camp rostóv rode up to bagration reported to
him and then joined the adjutants listening to what the generals were
saying

believe me said prince dolgorukov addressing bagration it is
nothing but a trick he has retreated and ordered the rearguard to
kindle fires and make a noise to deceive us

hardly said bagration i saw them this evening on that knoll if
they had retreated they would have withdrawn from that too officer
said bagration to rostóv are the enemys skirmishers still there

they were there this evening but now i dont know your excellency
shall i go with some of my hussars to see replied rostóv

bagration stopped and before replying tried to see rostóvs face in
the mist

well go and see he said after a pause

yes sir

rostóv spurred his horse called to sergeant fedchenko and two other
hussars told them to follow him and trotted downhill in the direction
from which the shouting came he felt both frightened and pleased to be
riding alone with three hussars into that mysterious and dangerous misty
distance where no one had been before him bagration called to him from
the hill not to go beyond the stream but rostóv pretended not to hear
him and did not stop but rode on and on continually mistaking bushes
for trees and gullies for men and continually discovering his mistakes
having descended the hill at a trot he no longer saw either our own or
the enemys fires but heard the shouting of the french more loudly and
distinctly in the valley he saw before him something like a river but
when he reached it he found it was a road having come out onto the road
he reined in his horse hesitating whether to ride along it or cross it
and ride over the black field up the hillside to keep to the road which
gleamed white in the mist would have been safer because it would be
easier to see people coming along it follow me said he crossed the
road and began riding up the hill at a gallop toward the point where
the french pickets had been standing that evening

your honor there he is cried one of the hussars behind him and
before rostóv had time to make out what the black thing was that had
suddenly appeared in the fog there was a flash followed by a report
and a bullet whizzing high up in the mist with a plaintive sound passed
out of hearing another musket missed fire but flashed in the pan
rostóv turned his horse and galloped back four more reports followed at
intervals and the bullets passed somewhere in the fog singing in
different tones rostóv reined in his horse whose spirits had risen
like his own at the firing and went back at a footpace well some
more some more a merry voice was saying in his soul but no more
shots came

only when approaching bagration did rostóv let his horse gallop again
and with his hand at the salute rode up to the general

dolgorukov was still insisting that the french had retreated and had
only lit fires to deceive us

what does that prove he was saying as rostóv rode up they might
retreat and leave the pickets

its plain that they have not all gone yet prince said bagration
wait till tomorrow morning well find out everything tomorrow

the picket is still on the hill your excellency just where it was in
the evening reported rostóv stooping forward with his hand at the
salute and unable to repress the smile of delight induced by his ride
and especially by the sound of the bullets

very good very good said bagration thank you officer

your excellency said rostóv may i ask a favor

what is it

tomorrow our squadron is to be in reserve may i ask to be attached to
the first squadron

whats your name

count rostóv

oh very well you may stay in attendance on me

count ilyá rostóvs son asked dolgorukov

but rostóv did not reply

then i may reckon on it your excellency

i will give the order

tomorrow very likely i may be sent with some message to the emperor
thought rostóv

thank god

the fires and shouting in the enemys army were occasioned by the fact
that while napoleons proclamation was being read to the troops the
emperor himself rode round his bivouacs the soldiers on seeing him
lit wisps of straw and ran after him shouting vive lempereur
napoleons proclamation was as follows

soldiers the russian army is advancing against you to avenge the
austrian army of ulm they are the same battalions you broke at
hollabrunn and have pursued ever since to this place the position we
occupy is a strong one and while they are marching to go round me on
the right they will expose a flank to me soldiers i will myself direct
your battalions i will keep out of fire if you with your habitual valor
carry disorder and confusion into the enemys ranks but should victory
be in doubt even for a moment you will see your emperor exposing
himself to the first blows of the enemy for there must be no doubt of
victory especially on this day when what is at stake is the honor of
the french infantry so necessary to the honor of our nation

do not break your ranks on the plea of removing the wounded let every
man be fully imbued with the thought that we must defeat these hirelings
of england inspired by such hatred of our nation this victory will
conclude our campaign and we can return to winter quarters where fresh
french troops who are being raised in france will join us and the peace
i shall conclude will be worthy of my people of you and of myself

napoleon




chapter xiv

at five in the morning it was still quite dark the troops of the
center the reserves and bagrations right flank had not yet moved but
on the left flank the columns of infantry cavalry and artillery which
were to be the first to descend the heights to attack the french right
flank and drive it into the bohemian mountains according to plan were
already up and astir the smoke of the campfires into which they were
throwing everything superfluous made the eyes smart it was cold and
dark the officers were hurriedly drinking tea and breakfasting the
soldiers munching biscuit and beating a tattoo with their feet to warm
themselves gathering round the fires throwing into the flames the
remains of sheds chairs tables wheels tubs and everything that they
did not want or could not carry away with them austrian column guides
were moving in and out among the russian troops and served as heralds of
the advance as soon as an austrian officer showed himself near a
commanding officers quarters the regiment began to move the soldiers
ran from the fires thrust their pipes into their boots their bags into
the carts got their muskets ready and formed rank the officers
buttoned up their coats buckled on their swords and pouches and moved
along the ranks shouting the train drivers and orderlies harnessed and
packed the wagons and tied on the loads the adjutants and battalion and
regimental commanders mounted crossed themselves gave final
instructions orders and commissions to the baggage men who remained
behind and the monotonous tramp of thousands of feet resounded the
column moved forward without knowing where and unable from the masses
around them the smoke and the increasing fog to see either the place
they were leaving or that to which they were going

a soldier on the march is hemmed in and borne along by his regiment as
much as a sailor is by his ship however far he has walked whatever
strange unknown and dangerous places he reaches just as a sailor is
always surrounded by the same decks masts and rigging of his ship so
the soldier always has around him the same comrades the same ranks the
same sergeant major ivan mitrich the same company dog jack and the
same commanders the sailor rarely cares to know the latitude in which
his ship is sailing but on the day of battleheaven knows how and
whencea stern note of which all are conscious sounds in the moral
atmosphere of an army announcing the approach of something decisive and
solemn and awakening in the men an unusual curiosity on the day of
battle the soldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests of their
regiment they listen intently look about and eagerly ask concerning
what is going on around them

the fog had grown so dense that though it was growing light they could
not see ten paces ahead bushes looked like gigantic trees and level
ground like cliffs and slopes anywhere on any side one might
encounter an enemy invisible ten paces off but the columns advanced for
a long time always in the same fog descending and ascending hills
avoiding gardens and enclosures going over new and unknown ground and
nowhere encountering the enemy on the contrary the soldiers became
aware that in front behind and on all sides other russian columns
were moving in the same direction every soldier felt glad to know that
to the unknown place where he was going many more of our men were going
too

there now the kurskies have also gone past was being said in the
ranks

its wonderful what a lot of our troops have gathered lads last night
i looked at the campfires and there was no end of them a regular
moscow

though none of the column commanders rode up to the ranks or talked to
the men the commanders as we saw at the council of war were out of
humor and dissatisfied with the affair and so did not exert themselves
to cheer the men but merely carried out the orders yet the troops
marched gaily as they always do when going into action especially to
an attack but when they had marched for about an hour in the dense fog
the greater part of the men had to halt and an unpleasant consciousness
of some dislocation and blunder spread through the ranks how such a
consciousness is communicated is very difficult to define but it
certainly is communicated very surely and flows rapidly imperceptibly
and irrepressibly as water does in a creek had the russian army been
alone without any allies it might perhaps have been a long time before
this consciousness of mismanagement became a general conviction but as
it was the disorder was readily and naturally attributed to the stupid
germans and everyone was convinced that a dangerous muddle had been
occasioned by the sausage eaters

why have we stopped is the way blocked or have we already come up
against the french

no one cant hear them theyd be firing if we had

they were in a hurry enough to start us and now here we stand in the
middle of a field without rhyme or reason its all those damned
germans muddling what stupid devils

yes id send them on in front but no fear theyre crowding up
behind and now here we stand hungry

i say shall we soon be clear they say the cavalry are blocking the
way said an officer

ah those damned germans they dont know their own country said
another

what division are you shouted an adjutant riding up

the eighteenth

then why are you here you should have gone on long ago now you wont
get there till evening

what stupid orders they dont themselves know what they are doing
said the officer and rode off

then a general rode past shouting something angrily not in russian

tafalafa but what hes jabbering no one can make out said a
soldier mimicking the general who had ridden away id shoot them the
scoundrels

we were ordered to be at the place before nine but we havent got
halfway fine orders was being repeated on different sides

and the feeling of energy with which the troops had started began to
turn into vexation and anger at the stupid arrangements and at the
germans

the cause of the confusion was that while the austrian cavalry was
moving toward our left flank the higher command found that our center
was too far separated from our right flank and the cavalry were all
ordered to turn back to the right several thousand cavalry crossed in
front of the infantry who had to wait

at the front an altercation occurred between an austrian guide and a
russian general the general shouted a demand that the cavalry should be
halted the austrian argued that not he but the higher command was to
blame the troops meanwhile stood growing listless and dispirited after
an hours delay they at last moved on descending the hill the fog that
was dispersing on the hill lay still more densely below where they were
descending in front in the fog a shot was heard and then another at
first irregularly at varying intervalstrata tatand then more and
more regularly and rapidly and the action at the goldbach stream began

not expecting to come on the enemy down by the stream and having
stumbled on him in the fog hearing no encouraging word from their
commanders and with a consciousness of being too late spreading through
the ranks and above all being unable to see anything in front or around
them in the thick fog the russians exchanged shots with the enemy
lazily and advanced and again halted receiving no timely orders from
the officers or adjutants who wandered about in the fog in those unknown
surroundings unable to find their own regiments in this way the action
began for the first second and third columns which had gone down into
the valley the fourth column with which kutúzov was stood on the
pratzen heights

below where the fight was beginning there was still thick fog on the
higher ground it was clearing but nothing could be seen of what was
going on in front whether all the enemy forces were as we supposed
six miles away or whether they were near by in that sea of mist no one
knew till after eight oclock

it was nine oclock in the morning the fog lay unbroken like a sea down
below but higher up at the village of schlappanitz where napoleon stood
with his marshals around him it was quite light above him was a clear
blue sky and the suns vast orb quivered like a huge hollow crimson
float on the surface of that milky sea of mist the whole french army
and even napoleon himself with his staff were not on the far side of
the streams and hollows of sokolnitz and schlappanitz beyond which we
intended to take up our position and begin the action but were on this
side so close to our own forces that napoleon with the naked eye could
distinguish a mounted man from one on foot napoleon in the blue cloak
which he had worn on his italian campaign sat on his small gray arab
horse a little in front of his marshals he gazed silently at the hills
which seemed to rise out of the sea of mist and on which the russian
troops were moving in the distance and he listened to the sounds of
firing in the valley not a single muscle of his facewhich in those
days was still thinmoved his gleaming eyes were fixed intently on one
spot his predictions were being justified part of the russian force
had already descended into the valley toward the ponds and lakes and
part were leaving these pratzen heights which he intended to attack and
regarded as the key to the position he saw over the mist that in a
hollow between two hills near the village of pratzen the russian
columns their bayonets glittering were moving continuously in one
direction toward the valley and disappearing one after another into the
mist from information he had received the evening before from the
sound of wheels and footsteps heard by the outposts during the night by
the disorderly movement of the russian columns and from all
indications he saw clearly that the allies believed him to be far away
in front of them and that the columns moving near pratzen constituted
the center of the russian army and that that center was already
sufficiently weakened to be successfully attacked but still he did not
begin the engagement

today was a great day for himthe anniversary of his coronation before
dawn he had slept for a few hours and refreshed vigorous and in good
spirits he mounted his horse and rode out into the field in that happy
mood in which everything seems possible and everything succeeds he sat
motionless looking at the heights visible above the mist and his cold
face wore that special look of confident selfcomplacent happiness that
one sees on the face of a boy happily in love the marshals stood behind
him not venturing to distract his attention he looked now at the
pratzen heights now at the sun floating up out of the mist

when the sun had entirely emerged from the fog and fields and mist were
aglow with dazzling lightas if he had only awaited this to begin the
actionhe drew the glove from his shapely white hand made a sign with
it to the marshals and ordered the action to begin the marshals
accompanied by adjutants galloped off in different directions and a
few minutes later the chief forces of the french army moved rapidly
toward those pratzen heights which were being more and more denuded by
russian troops moving down the valley to their left





chapter xv

at eight oclock kutúzov rode to pratzen at the head of the fourth
column miloradovichs the one that was to take the place of
przebyszewskis and langerons columns which had already gone down into
the valley he greeted the men of the foremost regiment and gave them
the order to march thereby indicating that he intended to lead that
column himself when he had reached the village of pratzen he halted
prince andrew was behind among the immense number forming the
commanderinchiefs suite he was in a state of suppressed excitement
and irritation though controlledly calm as a man is at the approach of
a longawaited moment he was firmly convinced that this was the day of
his toulon or his bridge of arcola how it would come about he did not
know but he felt sure it would do so the locality and the position of
our troops were known to him as far as they could be known to anyone in
our army his own strategic plan which obviously could not now be
carried out was forgotten now entering into weyrothers plan prince
andrew considered possible contingencies and formed new projects such as
might call for his rapidity of perception and decision

to the left down below in the mist the musketry fire of unseen forces
could be heard it was there prince andrew thought the fight would
concentrate there we shall encounter difficulties and there thought
he i shall be sent with a brigade or division and there standard in
hand i shall go forward and break whatever is in front of me

he could not look calmly at the standards of the passing battalions
seeing them he kept thinking that may be the very standard with which
i shall lead the army

in the morning all that was left of the night mist on the heights was a
hoar frost now turning to dew but in the valleys it still lay like a
milkwhite sea nothing was visible in the valley to the left into which
our troops had descended and from whence came the sounds of firing
above the heights was the dark clear sky and to the right the vast orb
of the sun in front far off on the farther shore of that sea of mist
some wooded hills were discernible and it was there the enemy probably
was for something could be descried on the right the guards were
entering the misty region with a sound of hoofs and wheels and now and
then a gleam of bayonets to the left beyond the village similar masses
of cavalry came up and disappeared in the sea of mist in front and
behind moved infantry the commanderinchief was standing at the end of
the village letting the troops pass by him that morning kutúzov seemed
worn and irritable the infantry passing before him came to a halt
without any command being given apparently obstructed by something in
front

do order them to form into battalion columns and go round the village
he said angrily to a general who had ridden up dont you understand
your excellency my dear sir that you must not defile through narrow
village streets when we are marching against the enemy

i intended to reform them beyond the village your excellency
answered the general

kutúzov laughed bitterly

youll make a fine thing of it deploying in sight of the enemy very
fine

the enemy is still far away your excellency according to the
dispositions

the dispositions exclaimed kutúzov bitterly who told you that
kindly do as you are ordered

yes sir

my dear fellow nesvitski whispered to prince andrew the old man is
as surly as a dog

an austrian officer in a white uniform with green plumes in his hat
galloped up to kutúzov and asked in the emperors name had the fourth
column advanced into action

kutúzov turned round without answering and his eye happened to fall upon
prince andrew who was beside him seeing him kutúzovs malevolent and
caustic expression softened as if admitting that what was being done
was not his adjutants fault and still not answering the austrian
adjutant he addressed bolkónski

go my dear fellow and see whether the third division has passed the
village tell it to stop and await my orders

hardly had prince andrew started than he stopped him

and ask whether sharpshooters have been posted he added what are
they doing what are they doing he murmured to himself still not
replying to the austrian

prince andrew galloped off to execute the order

overtaking the battalions that continued to advance he stopped the
third division and convinced himself that there really were no
sharpshooters in front of our columns the colonel at the head of the
regiment was much surprised at the commanderinchiefs order to throw
out skirmishers he had felt perfectly sure that there were other troops
in front of him and that the enemy must be at least six miles away
there was really nothing to be seen in front except a barren descent
hidden by dense mist having given orders in the commanderinchiefs
name to rectify this omission prince andrew galloped back kutúzov
still in the same place his stout body resting heavily in the saddle
with the lassitude of age sat yawning wearily with closed eyes the
troops were no longer moving but stood with the butts of their muskets
on the ground

all right all right he said to prince andrew and turned to a
general who watch in hand was saying it was time they started as all
the leftflank columns had already descended

plenty of time your excellency muttered kutúzov in the midst of a
yawn plenty of time he repeated

just then at a distance behind kutúzov was heard the sound of regiments
saluting and this sound rapidly came nearer along the whole extended
line of the advancing russian columns evidently the person they were
greeting was riding quickly when the soldiers of the regiment in front
of which kutúzov was standing began to shout he rode a little to one
side and looked round with a frown along the road from pratzen galloped
what looked like a squadron of horsemen in various uniforms two of them
rode side by side in front at full gallop one in a black uniform with
white plumes in his hat rode a bobtailed chestnut horse the other who
was in a white uniform rode a black one these were the two emperors
followed by their suites kutúzov affecting the manners of an old
soldier at the front gave the command attention and rode up to the
emperors with a salute his whole appearance and manner were suddenly
transformed he put on the air of a subordinate who obeys without
reasoning with an affectation of respect which evidently struck
alexander unpleasantly he rode up and saluted

this unpleasant impression merely flitted over the young and happy face
of the emperor like a cloud of haze across a clear sky and vanished
after his illness he looked rather thinner that day than on the field of
olmutz where bolkónski had seen him for the first time abroad but there
was still the same bewitching combination of majesty and mildness in his
fine gray eyes and on his delicate lips the same capacity for varying
expression and the same prevalent appearance of goodhearted innocent
youth

at the olmutz review he had seemed more majestic here he seemed
brighter and more energetic he was slightly flushed after galloping two
miles and reining in his horse he sighed restfully and looked round at
the faces of his suite young and animated as his own czartoryski
novosíltsev prince volkonsky strogonov and the others all richly
dressed gay young men on splendid wellgroomed fresh only slightly
heated horses exchanging remarks and smiling had stopped behind the
emperor the emperor francis a rosy long faced young man sat very
erect on his handsome black horse looking about him in a leisurely and
preoccupied manner he beckoned to one of his white adjutants and asked
some questionmost likely he is asking at what oclock they started
thought prince andrew watching his old acquaintance with a smile he
could not repress as he recalled his reception at brunn in the
emperors suite were the picked young orderly officers of the guard and
line regiments russian and austrian among them were grooms leading the
tsars beautiful relay horses covered with embroidered cloths

as when a window is opened a whiff of fresh air from the fields enters a
stuffy room so a whiff of youthfulness energy and confidence of
success reached kutúzovs cheerless staff with the galloping advent of
all these brilliant young men

why arent you beginning michael ilariónovich said the emperor
alexander hurriedly to kutúzov glancing courteously at the same time at
the emperor francis

i am waiting your majesty answered kutúzov bending forward
respectfully

the emperor frowning slightly bent his ear forward as if he had not
quite heard

waiting your majesty repeated kutúzov prince andrew noted that
kutúzovs upper lip twitched unnaturally as he said the word waiting
not all the columns have formed up yet your majesty

the tsar heard but obviously did not like the reply he shrugged his
rather round shoulders and glanced at novosíltsev who was near him as
if complaining of kutúzov

you know michael ilariónovich we are not on the empress field where
a parade does not begin till all the troops are assembled said the
tsar with another glance at the emperor francis as if inviting him if
not to join in at least to listen to what he was saying but the emperor
francis continued to look about him and did not listen

that is just why i do not begin sire said kutúzov in a resounding
voice apparently to preclude the possibility of not being heard and
again something in his face twitchedthat is just why i do not begin
sire because we are not on parade and not on the empress field said
clearly and distinctly

in the emperors suite all exchanged rapid looks that expressed
dissatisfaction and reproach old though he may be he should not he
certainly should not speak like that their glances seemed to say

the tsar looked intently and observantly into kutúzovs eye waiting to
hear whether he would say anything more but kutúzov with respectfully
bowed head seemed also to be waiting the silence lasted for about a
minute

however if you command it your majesty said kutúzov lifting his
head and again assuming his former tone of a dull unreasoning but
submissive general

he touched his horse and having called miloradovich the commander of
the column gave him the order to advance

the troops again began to move and two battalions of the novgorod and
one of the apsheron regiment went forward past the emperor

as this apsheron battalion marched by the redfaced miloradovich
without his greatcoat with his orders on his breast and an enormous
tuft of plumes in his cocked hat worn on one side with its corners front
and back galloped strenuously forward and with a dashing salute reined
in his horse before the emperor

god be with you general said the emperor

ma foi sire nous ferons ce qui sera dans notre possibilite sire
he answered gaily raising nevertheless ironic smiles among the
gentlemen of the tsars suite by his poor french

 indeed sire we shall do everything it is possible to do sire

miloradovich wheeled his horse sharply and stationed himself a little
behind the emperor the apsheron men excited by the tsars presence
passed in step before the emperors and their suites at a bold brisk
pace

lads shouted miloradovich in a loud selfconfident and cheery
voice obviously so elated by the sound of firing by the prospect of
battle and by the sight of the gallant apsherons his comrades in
suvórovs time now passing so gallantly before the emperors that he
forgot the sovereigns presence lads its not the first village
youve had to take cried he

glad to do our best shouted the soldiers

the emperors horse started at the sudden cry this horse that had
carried the sovereign at reviews in russia bore him also here on the
field of austerlitz enduring the heedless blows of his left foot and
pricking its ears at the sound of shots just as it had done on the
empress field not understanding the significance of the firing nor of
the nearness of the emperor francis black cob nor of all that was
being said thought and felt that day by its rider

the emperor turned with a smile to one of his followers and made a
remark to him pointing to the gallant apsherons





chapter xvi

kutúzov accompanied by his adjutants rode at a walking pace behind the
carabineers

when he had gone less than half a mile in the rear of the column he
stopped at a solitary deserted house that had probably once been an
inn where two roads parted both of them led downhill and troops were
marching along both

the fog had begun to clear and enemy troops were already dimly visible
about a mile and a half off on the opposite heights down below on the
left the firing became more distinct kutúzov had stopped and was
speaking to an austrian general prince andrew who was a little behind
looking at them turned to an adjutant to ask him for a field glass

look look said this adjutant looking not at the troops in the
distance but down the hill before him its the french

the two generals and the adjutant took hold of the field glass trying
to snatch it from one another the expression on all their faces
suddenly changed to one of horror the french were supposed to be a mile
and a half away but had suddenly and unexpectedly appeared just in
front of us

its the enemy no yes see it is for certain but how is
that said different voices

with the naked eye prince andrew saw below them to the right not more
than five hundred paces from where kutúzov was standing a dense french
column coming up to meet the apsherons

here it is the decisive moment has arrived my turn has come thought
prince andrew and striking his horse he rode up to kutúzov

the apsherons must be stopped your excellency cried he but at that
very instant a cloud of smoke spread all round firing was heard quite
close at hand and a voice of naïve terror barely two steps from prince
andrew shouted brothers alls lost and at this as if at a command
everyone began to run

confused and everincreasing crowds were running back to where five
minutes before the troops had passed the emperors not only would it
have been difficult to stop that crowd it was even impossible not to be
carried back with it oneself bolkónski only tried not to lose touch
with it and looked around bewildered and unable to grasp what was
happening in front of him nesvitski with an angry face red and unlike
himself was shouting to kutúzov that if he did not ride away at once he
would certainly be taken prisoner kutúzov remained in the same place
and without answering drew out a handkerchief blood was flowing from
his cheek prince andrew forced his way to him

you are wounded he asked hardly able to master the trembling of his
lower jaw

the wound is not here it is there said kutúzov pressing the
handkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing soldiers
stop them he shouted and at the same moment probably realizing that
it was impossible to stop them spurred his horse and rode to the right

a fresh wave of the flying mob caught him and bore him back with it

the troops were running in such a dense mass that once surrounded by
them it was difficult to get out again one was shouting get on why
are you hindering us another in the same place turned round and fired
in the air a third was striking the horse kutúzov himself rode having
by a great effort got away to the left from that flood of men kutúzov
with his suite diminished by more than half rode toward a sound of
artillery fire near by having forced his way out of the crowd of
fugitives prince andrew trying to keep near kutúzov saw on the slope
of the hill amid the smoke a russian battery that was still firing and
frenchmen running toward it higher up stood some russian infantry
neither moving forward to protect the battery nor backward with the
fleeing crowd a mounted general separated himself from the infantry and
approached kutúzov of kutúzovs suite only four remained they were all
pale and exchanged looks in silence

stop those wretches gasped kutúzov to the regimental commander
pointing to the flying soldiers but at that instant as if to punish
him for those words bullets flew hissing across the regiment and across
kutúzovs suite like a flock of little birds

the french had attacked the battery and seeing kutúzov were firing at
him after this volley the regimental commander clutched at his leg
several soldiers fell and a second lieutenant who was holding the flag
let it fall from his hands it swayed and fell but caught on the
muskets of the nearest soldiers the soldiers started firing without
orders

oh oh oh groaned kutúzov despairingly and looked around
bolkónski he whispered his voice trembling from a consciousness of
the feebleness of age bolkónski he whispered pointing to the
disordered battalion and at the enemy whats that

but before he had finished speaking prince andrew feeling tears of
shame and anger choking him had already leapt from his horse and run to
the standard

forward lads he shouted in a voice piercing as a childs

here it is thought he seizing the staff of the standard and hearing
with pleasure the whistle of bullets evidently aimed at him several
soldiers fell

hurrah shouted prince andrew and scarcely able to hold up the heavy
standard he ran forward with full confidence that the whole battalion
would follow him

and really he only ran a few steps alone one soldier moved and then
another and soon the whole battalion ran forward shouting hurrah and
overtook him a sergeant of the battalion ran up and took the flag that
was swaying from its weight in prince andrews hands but he was
immediately killed prince andrew again seized the standard and
dragging it by the staff ran on with the battalion in front he saw our
artillerymen some of whom were fighting while others having abandoned
their guns were running toward him he also saw french infantry
soldiers who were seizing the artillery horses and turning the guns
round prince andrew and the battalion were already within twenty paces
of the cannon he heard the whistle of bullets above him unceasingly and
to right and left of him soldiers continually groaned and dropped but
he did not look at them he looked only at what was going on in front of
himat the battery he now saw clearly the figure of a redhaired gunner
with his shako knocked awry pulling one end of a mop while a french
soldier tugged at the other he could distinctly see the distraught yet
angry expression on the faces of these two men who evidently did not
realize what they were doing

what are they about thought prince andrew as he gazed at them why
doesnt the redhaired gunner run away as he is unarmed why doesnt the
frenchman stab him he will not get away before the frenchman remembers
his bayonet and stabs him

and really another french soldier trailing his musket ran up to the
struggling men and the fate of the redhaired gunner who had
triumphantly secured the mop and still did not realize what awaited him
was about to be decided but prince andrew did not see how it ended it
seemed to him as though one of the soldiers near him hit him on the head
with the full swing of a bludgeon it hurt a little but the worst of it
was that the pain distracted him and prevented his seeing what he had
been looking at

whats this am i falling my legs are giving way thought he and
fell on his back he opened his eyes hoping to see how the struggle of
the frenchmen with the gunners ended whether the redhaired gunner had
been killed or not and whether the cannon had been captured or saved
but he saw nothing above him there was now nothing but the skythe
lofty sky not clear yet still immeasurably lofty with gray clouds
gliding slowly across it how quiet peaceful and solemn not at all
as i ran thought prince andrewnot as we ran shouting and fighting
not at all as the gunner and the frenchman with frightened and angry
faces struggled for the mop how differently do those clouds glide
across that lofty infinite sky how was it i did not see that lofty sky
before and how happy i am to have found it at last yes all is vanity
all falsehood except that infinite sky there is nothing nothing but
that but even it does not exist there is nothing but quiet and peace
thank god





chapter xvii

on our right flank commanded by bagration at nine oclock the battle
had not yet begun not wishing to agree to dolgorukovs demand to
commence the action and wishing to avert responsibility from himself
prince bagration proposed to dolgorukov to send to inquire of the
commanderinchief bagration knew that as the distance between the two
flanks was more than six miles even if the messenger were not killed
which he very likely would be and found the commanderinchief which
would be very difficult he would not be able to get back before
evening

bagration cast his large expressionless sleepy eyes round his suite
and the boyish face rostóv breathless with excitement and hope was the
first to catch his eye he sent him

and if i should meet his majesty before i meet the commanderinchief
your excellency said rostóv with his hand to his cap

you can give the message to his majesty said dolgorukov hurriedly
interrupting bagration

on being relieved from picket duty rostóv had managed to get a few
hours sleep before morning and felt cheerful bold and resolute with
elasticity of movement faith in his good fortune and generally in that
state of mind which makes everything seem possible pleasant and easy

all his wishes were being fulfilled that morning there was to be a
general engagement in which he was taking part more than that he was
orderly to the bravest general and still more he was going with a
message to kutúzov perhaps even to the sovereign himself the morning
was bright he had a good horse under him and his heart was full of joy
and happiness on receiving the order he gave his horse the rein and
galloped along the line at first he rode along the line of bagrations
troops which had not yet advanced into action but were standing
motionless then he came to the region occupied by uvarovs cavalry and
here he noticed a stir and signs of preparation for battle having
passed uvarovs cavalry he clearly heard the sound of cannon and
musketry ahead of him the firing grew louder and louder

in the fresh morning air were now heard not two or three musket shots
at irregular intervals as before followed by one or two cannon shots
but a roll of volleys of musketry from the slopes of the hill before
pratzen interrupted by such frequent reports of cannon that sometimes
several of them were not separated from one another but merged into a
general roar

he could see puffs of musketry smoke that seemed to chase one another
down the hillsides and clouds of cannon smoke rolling spreading and
mingling with one another he could also by the gleam of bayonets
visible through the smoke make out moving masses of infantry and narrow
lines of artillery with green caissons

rostóv stopped his horse for a moment on a hillock to see what was going
on but strain his attention as he would he could not understand or make
out anything of what was happening there in the smoke men of some sort
were moving about in front and behind moved lines of troops but why
whither and who they were it was impossible to make out these sights
and sounds had no depressing or intimidating effect on him on the
contrary they stimulated his energy and determination

go on go on give it them he mentally exclaimed at these sounds and
again proceeded to gallop along the line penetrating farther and
farther into the region where the army was already in action

how it will be there i dont know but all will be well thought
rostóv

after passing some austrian troops he noticed that the next part of the
line the guards was already in action

so much the better i shall see it close he thought

he was riding almost along the front line a handful of men came
galloping toward him they were our uhlans who with disordered ranks
were returning from the attack rostóv got out of their way
involuntarily noticed that one of them was bleeding and galloped on

that is no business of mine he thought he had not ridden many
hundred yards after that before he saw to his left across the whole
width of the field an enormous mass of cavalry in brilliant white
uniforms mounted on black horses trotting straight toward him and
across his path rostóv put his horse to full gallop to get out of the
way of these men and he would have got clear had they continued at the
same speed but they kept increasing their pace so that some of the
horses were already galloping rostóv heard the thud of their hoofs and
the jingle of their weapons and saw their horses their figures and
even their faces more and more distinctly they were our horse guards
advancing to attack the french cavalry that was coming to meet them

the horse guards were galloping but still holding in their horses
rostóv could already see their faces and heard the command charge
shouted by an officer who was urging his thoroughbred to full speed
rostóv fearing to be crushed or swept into the attack on the french
galloped along the front as hard as his horse could go but still was
not in time to avoid them

the last of the horse guards a huge pockmarked fellow frowned angrily
on seeing rostóv before him with whom he would inevitably collide this
guardsman would certainly have bowled rostóv and his bedouin over
rostóv felt himself quite tiny and weak compared to these gigantic men
and horses had it not occurred to rostóv to flourish his whip before
the eyes of the guardsmans horse the heavy black horse sixteen hands
high shied throwing back its ears but the pockmarked guardsman drove
his huge spurs in violently and the horse flourishing its tail and
extending its neck galloped on yet faster hardly had the horse guards
passed rostóv before he heard them shout hurrah and looking back saw
that their foremost ranks were mixed up with some foreign cavalry with
red epaulets probably french he could see nothing more for
immediately afterwards cannon began firing from somewhere and smoke
enveloped everything

at that moment as the horse guards having passed him disappeared in
the smoke rostóv hesitated whether to gallop after them or to go where
he was sent this was the brilliant charge of the horse guards that
amazed the french themselves rostóv was horrified to hear later that of
all that mass of huge and handsome men of all those brilliant rich
youths officers and cadets who had galloped past him on their
thousandruble horses only eighteen were left after the charge

why should i envy them my chance is not lost and maybe i shall see
the emperor immediately thought rostóv and galloped on

when he came level with the foot guards he noticed that about them and
around them cannon balls were flying of which he was aware not so much
because he heard their sound as because he saw uneasiness on the
soldiers faces and unnatural warlike solemnity on those of the
officers

passing behind one of the lines of a regiment of foot guards he heard a
voice calling him by name

rostóv

what he answered not recognizing borís

i say weve been in the front line our regiment attacked said borís
with the happy smile seen on the faces of young men who have been under
fire for the first time

rostóv stopped

have you he said well how did it go

we drove them back said borís with animation growing talkative can
you imagine it and he began describing how the guards having taken up
their position and seeing troops before them thought they were
austrians and all at once discovered from the cannon balls discharged
by those troops that they were themselves in the front line and had
unexpectedly to go into action rostóv without hearing borís to the end
spurred his horse

where are you off to asked borís

with a message to his majesty

there he is said borís thinking rostóv had said his highness and
pointing to the grand duke who with his high shoulders and frowning
brows stood a hundred paces away from them in his helmet and horse
guards jacket shouting something to a pale white uniformed austrian
officer

but thats the grand duke and i want the commanderinchief or the
emperor said rostóv and was about to spur his horse

count count shouted berg who ran up from the other side as eager as
borís count i am wounded in my right hand and he showed his
bleeding hand with a handkerchief tied round it and i remained at the
front i held my sword in my left hand count all our familythe von
bergshave been knights

he said something more but rostóv did not wait to hear it and rode
away

having passed the guards and traversed an empty space rostóv to avoid
again getting in front of the first line as he had done when the horse
guards charged followed the line of reserves going far round the place
where the hottest musket fire and cannonade were heard suddenly he
heard musket fire quite close in front of him and behind our troops
where he could never have expected the enemy to be

what can it be he thought the enemy in the rear of our army
impossible and suddenly he was seized by a panic of fear for himself
and for the issue of the whole battle but be that what it may he
reflected there is no riding round it now i must look for the
commander in chief here and if all is lost it is for me to perish with
the rest

the foreboding of evil that had suddenly come over rostóv was more and
more confirmed the farther he rode into the region behind the village of
pratzen which was full of troops of all kinds

what does it mean what is it whom are they firing at who is firing
rostóv kept asking as he came up to russian and austrian soldiers
running in confused crowds across his path

the devil knows theyve killed everybody its all up now he was
told in russian german and czech by the crowd of fugitives who
understood what was happening as little as he did

kill the germans shouted one

may the devil take themthe traitors

zum henker diese russen  muttered a german

 hang these russians

several wounded men passed along the road and words of abuse screams
and groans mingled in a general hubbub then the firing died down
rostóv learned later that russian and austrian soldiers had been firing
at one another

my god what does it all mean thought he and here where at any
moment the emperor may see them but no these must be only a handful
of scoundrels it will soon be over it cant be that it cant be only
to get past them quicker quicker

the idea of defeat and flight could not enter rostóvs head though he
saw french cannon and french troops on the pratzen heights just where he
had been ordered to look for the commanderinchief he could not did
not wish to believe that





chapter xviii

rostóv had been ordered to look for kutúzov and the emperor near the
village of pratzen but neither they nor a single commanding officer
were there only disorganized crowds of troops of various kinds he
urged on his already weary horse to get quickly past these crowds but
the farther he went the more disorganized they were the highroad on
which he had come out was thronged with caleches carriages of all
sorts and russian and austrian soldiers of all arms some wounded and
some not this whole mass droned and jostled in confusion under the
dismal influence of cannon balls flying from the french batteries
stationed on the pratzen heights

where is the emperor where is kutúzov rostóv kept asking everyone he
could stop but got no answer from anyone

at last seizing a soldier by his collar he forced him to answer

eh brother theyve all bolted long ago said the soldier laughing
for some reason and shaking himself free

having left that soldier who was evidently drunk rostóv stopped the
horse of a batman or groom of some important personage and began to
question him the man announced that the tsar had been driven in a
carriage at full speed about an hour before along that very road and
that he was dangerously wounded

it cant be said rostóv it must have been someone else

i saw him myself replied the man with a selfconfident smile of
derision i ought to know the emperor by now after the times ive seen
him in petersburg i saw him just as i see you there he sat in the
carriage as pale as anything how they made the four black horses fly
gracious me they did rattle past its time i knew the imperial horses
and ilyá ivanych i dont think ilyá drives anyone except the tsar

rostóv let go of the horse and was about to ride on when a wounded
officer passing by addressed him

who is it you want he asked the commanderinchief he was killed
by a cannon ballstruck in the breast before our regiment

not killedwounded another officer corrected him

who kutúzov asked rostóv

not kutúzov but whats his namewell never mind there are not many
left alive go that way to that village all the commanders are there
said the officer pointing to the village of hosjeradek and he walked
on

rostóv rode on at a footpace not knowing why or to whom he was now
going the emperor was wounded the battle lost it was impossible to
doubt it now rostóv rode in the direction pointed out to him in which
he saw turrets and a church what need to hurry what was he now to say
to the tsar or to kutúzov even if they were alive and unwounded

take this road your honor that way you will be killed at once a
soldier shouted to him theyd kill you there

oh what are you talking about said another where is he to go that
way is nearer

rostóv considered and then went in the direction where they said he
would be killed

its all the same now if the emperor is wounded am i to try to save
myself he thought he rode on to the region where the greatest number
of men had perished in fleeing from pratzen the french had not yet
occupied that region and the russiansthe uninjured and slightly
woundedhad left it long ago all about the field like heaps of manure
on wellkept plowland lay from ten to fifteen dead and wounded to each
couple of acres the wounded crept together in twos and threes and one
could hear their distressing screams and groans sometimes feignedor so
it seemed to rostóv he put his horse to a trot to avoid seeing all
these suffering men and he felt afraidafraid not for his life but for
the courage he needed and which he knew would not stand the sight of
these unfortunates

the french who had ceased firing at this field strewn with dead and
wounded where there was no one left to fire at on seeing an adjutant
riding over it trained a gun on him and fired several shots the
sensation of those terrible whistling sounds and of the corpses around
him merged in rostóvs mind into a single feeling of terror and pity for
himself he remembered his mothers last letter what would she feel
thought he if she saw me here now on this field with the cannon aimed
at me

in the village of hosjeradek there were russian troops retiring from the
field of battle who though still in some confusion were less
disordered the french cannon did not reach there and the musketry fire
sounded far away here everyone clearly saw and said that the battle was
lost no one whom rostóv asked could tell him where the emperor or
kutúzov was some said the report that the emperor was wounded was
correct others that it was not and explained the false rumor that had
spread by the fact that the emperors carriage had really galloped from
the field of battle with the pale and terrified oberhofmarschal count
tolstóy who had ridden out to the battlefield with others in the
emperors suite one officer told rostóv that he had seen someone from
headquarters behind the village to the left and thither rostóv rode
not hoping to find anyone but merely to ease his conscience when he had
ridden about two miles and had passed the last of the russian troops he
saw near a kitchen garden with a ditch round it two men on horseback
facing the ditch one with a white plume in his hat seemed familiar to
rostóv the other on a beautiful chestnut horse which rostóv fancied he
had seen before rode up to the ditch struck his horse with his spurs
and giving it the rein leaped lightly over only a little earth crumbled
from the bank under the horses hind hoofs turning the horse sharply
he again jumped the ditch and deferentially addressed the horseman with
the white plumes evidently suggesting that he should do the same the
rider whose figure seemed familiar to rostóv and involuntarily riveted
his attention made a gesture of refusal with his head and hand and by
that gesture rostóv instantly recognized his lamented and adored
monarch

but it cant be he alone in the midst of this empty field thought
rostóv at that moment alexander turned his head and rostóv saw the
beloved features that were so deeply engraved on his memory the emperor
was pale his cheeks sunken and his eyes hollow but the charm the
mildness of his features was all the greater rostóv was happy in the
assurance that the rumors about the emperor being wounded were false he
was happy to be seeing him he knew that he might and even ought to go
straight to him and give the message dolgorukov had ordered him to
deliver

but as a youth in love trembles is unnerved and dares not utter the
thoughts he has dreamed of for nights but looks around for help or a
chance of delay and flight when the longedfor moment comes and he is
alone with her so rostóv now that he had attained what he had longed
for more than anything else in the world did not know how to approach
the emperor and a thousand reasons occurred to him why it would be
inconvenient unseemly and impossible to do so

what it is as if i were glad of a chance to take advantage of his
being alone and despondent a strange face may seem unpleasant or
painful to him at this moment of sorrow besides what can i say to him
now when my heart fails me and my mouth feels dry at the mere sight of
him not one of the innumerable speeches addressed to the emperor that
he had composed in his imagination could he now recall those speeches
were intended for quite other conditions they were for the most part to
be spoken at a moment of victory and triumph generally when he was
dying of wounds and the sovereign had thanked him for heroic deeds and
while dying he expressed the love his actions had proved

besides how can i ask the emperor for his instructions for the right
flank now that it is nearly four oclock and the battle is lost no
certainly i must not approach him i must not intrude on his
reflections better die a thousand times than risk receiving an unkind
look or bad opinion from him rostóv decided and sorrowfully and with
a heart full despair he rode away continually looking back at the tsar
who still remained in the same attitude of indecision

while rostóv was thus arguing with himself and riding sadly away
captain von toll chanced to ride to the same spot and seeing the
emperor at once rode up to him offered his services and assisted him
to cross the ditch on foot the emperor wishing to rest and feeling
unwell sat down under an apple tree and von toll remained beside him
rostóv from a distance saw with envy and remorse how von toll spoke long
and warmly to the emperor and how the emperor evidently weeping
covered his eyes with his hand and pressed von tolls hand

and i might have been in his place thought rostóv and hardly
restraining his tears of pity for the emperor he rode on in utter
despair not knowing where to or why he was now riding

his despair was all the greater from feeling that his own weakness was
the cause of his grief

he might not only might but should have gone up to the sovereign it
was a unique chance to show his devotion to the emperor and he had not
made use of it what have i done thought he and he turned round
and galloped back to the place where he had seen the emperor but there
was no one beyond the ditch now only some carts and carriages were
passing by from one of the drivers he learned that kutúzovs staff were
not far off in the village the vehicles were going to rostóv followed
them in front of him walked kutúzovs groom leading horses in
horsecloths then came a cart and behind that walked an old bandy
legged domestic serf in a peaked cap and sheepskin coat

tit i say tit said the groom

what answered the old man absentmindedly

go tit thresh a bit

oh you fool said the old man spitting angrily some time passed in
silence and then the same joke was repeated

before five in the evening the battle had been lost at all points more
than a hundred cannon were already in the hands of the french

przebyszewski and his corps had laid down their arms other columns
after losing half their men were retreating in disorderly confused
masses

the remains of langerons and dokhturovs mingled forces were crowding
around the dams and banks of the ponds near the village of augesd

after five oclock it was only at the augesd dam that a hot cannonade
delivered by the french alone was still to be heard from numerous
batteries ranged on the slopes of the pratzen heights directed at our
retreating forces

in the rearguard dokhturov and others rallying some battalions kept up
a musketry fire at the french cavalry that was pursuing our troops it
was growing dusk on the narrow augesd dam where for so many years the
old miller had been accustomed to sit in his tasseled cap peacefully
angling while his grandson with shirt sleeves rolled up handled the
floundering silvery fish in the watering can on that dam over which for
so many years moravians in shaggy caps and blue jackets had peacefully
driven their twohorse carts loaded with wheat and had returned dusty
with flour whitening their cartson that narrow dam amid the wagons and
the cannon under the horses hoofs and between the wagon wheels men
disfigured by fear of death now crowded together crushing one another
dying stepping over the dying and killing one another only to move on
a few steps and be killed themselves in the same way

every ten seconds a cannon ball flew compressing the air around or a
shell burst in the midst of that dense throng killing some and
splashing with blood those near them

dólokhovnow an officerwounded in the arm and on foot with the
regimental commander on horseback and some ten men of his company
represented all that was left of that whole regiment impelled by the
crowd they had got wedged in at the approach to the dam and jammed in
on all sides had stopped because a horse in front had fallen under a
cannon and the crowd were dragging it out a cannon ball killed someone
behind them another fell in front and splashed dólokhov with blood the
crowd pushing forward desperately squeezed together moved a few
steps and again stopped

move on a hundred yards and we are certainly saved remain here another
two minutes and it is certain death thought each one

dólokhov who was in the midst of the crowd forced his way to the edge of
the dam throwing two soldiers off their feet and ran onto the slippery
ice that covered the millpool

turn this way he shouted jumping over the ice which creaked under
him turn this way he shouted to those with the gun it bears

the ice bore him but it swayed and creaked and it was plain that it
would give way not only under a cannon or a crowd but very soon even
under his weight alone the men looked at him and pressed to the bank
hesitating to step onto the ice the general on horseback at the
entrance to the dam raised his hand and opened his mouth to address
dólokhov suddenly a cannon ball hissed so low above the crowd that
everyone ducked it flopped into something moist and the general fell
from his horse in a pool of blood nobody gave him a look or thought of
raising him

get onto the ice over the ice go on turn dont you hear go on
innumerable voices suddenly shouted after the ball had struck the
general the men themselves not knowing what or why they were
shouting

one of the hindmost guns that was going onto the dam turned off onto the
ice crowds of soldiers from the dam began running onto the frozen pond
the ice gave way under one of the foremost soldiers and one leg slipped
into the water he tried to right himself but fell in up to his waist
the nearest soldiers shrank back the gun driver stopped his horse but
from behind still came the shouts onto the ice why do you stop go
on go on and cries of horror were heard in the crowd the soldiers
near the gun waved their arms and beat the horses to make them turn and
move on the horses moved off the bank the ice that had held under
those on foot collapsed in a great mass and some forty men who were on
it dashed some forward and some back drowning one another

still the cannon balls continued regularly to whistle and flop onto the
ice and into the water and oftenest of all among the crowd that covered
the dam the pond and the bank





chapter xix

on the pratzen heights where he had fallen with the flagstaff in his
hand lay prince andrew bolkónski bleeding profusely and unconsciously
uttering a gentle piteous and childlike moan

toward evening he ceased moaning and became quite still he did not know
how long his unconsciousness lasted suddenly he again felt that he was
alive and suffering from a burning lacerating pain in his head

where is it that lofty sky that i did not know till now but saw
today was his first thought and i did not know this suffering
either he thought yes i did not know anything anything at all till
now but where am i

he listened and heard the sound of approaching horses and voices
speaking french he opened his eyes above him again was the same lofty
sky with clouds that had risen and were floating still higher and
between them gleamed blue infinity he did not turn his head and did not
see those who judging by the sound of hoofs and voices had ridden up
and stopped near him

it was napoleon accompanied by two aidesdecamp bonaparte riding over
the battlefield had given final orders to strengthen the batteries
firing at the augesd dam and was looking at the killed and wounded left
on the field

fine men remarked napoleon looking at a dead russian grenadier who
with his face buried in the ground and a blackened nape lay on his
stomach with an already stiffened arm flung wide

the ammunition for the guns in position is exhausted your majesty
said an adjutant who had come from the batteries that were firing at
augesd

have some brought from the reserve said napoleon and having gone on
a few steps he stopped before prince andrew who lay on his back with
the flagstaff that had been dropped beside him the flag had already
been taken by the french as a trophy

thats a fine death said napoleon as he gazed at bolkónski

prince andrew understood that this was said of him and that it was
napoleon who said it he heard the speaker addressed as sire but he
heard the words as he might have heard the buzzing of a fly not only
did they not interest him but he took no notice of them and at once
forgot them his head was burning he felt himself bleeding to death
and he saw above him the remote lofty and everlasting sky he knew it
was napoleonhis herobut at that moment napoleon seemed to him such a
small insignificant creature compared with what was passing now between
himself and that lofty infinite sky with the clouds flying over it at
that moment it meant nothing to him who might be standing over him or
what was said of him he was only glad that people were standing near
him and only wished that they would help him and bring him back to life
which seemed to him so beautiful now that he had today learned to
understand it so differently he collected all his strength to stir and
utter a sound he feebly moved his leg and uttered a weak sickly groan
which aroused his own pity

ah he is alive said napoleon lift this young man up and carry him
to the dressing station

having said this napoleon rode on to meet marshal lannes who hat in
hand rode up smiling to the emperor to congratulate him on the victory

prince andrew remembered nothing more he lost consciousness from the
terrible pain of being lifted onto the stretcher the jolting while
being moved and the probing of his wound at the dressing station he
did not regain consciousness till late in the day when with other
wounded and captured russian officers he was carried to the hospital
during this transfer he felt a little stronger and was able to look
about him and even speak

the first words he heard on coming to his senses were those of a french
convoy officer who said rapidly we must halt here the emperor will
pass here immediately it will please him to see these gentlemen
prisoners

there are so many prisoners today nearly the whole russian army that
he is probably tired of them said another officer

all the same they say this one is the commander of all the emperor
alexanders guards said the first one indicating a russian officer in
the white uniform of the horse guards

bolkónski recognized prince repnin whom he had met in petersburg
society beside him stood a lad of nineteen also a wounded officer of
the horse guards

bonaparte having come up at a gallop stopped his horse

which is the senior he asked on seeing the prisoners

they named the colonel prince repnin

you are the commander of the emperor alexanders regiment of horse
guards asked napoleon

i commanded a squadron replied repnin

your regiment fulfilled its duty honorably said napoleon

the praise of a great commander is a soldiers highest reward said
repnin

i bestow it with pleasure said napoleon and who is that young man
beside you

prince repnin named lieutenant sukhtelen

after looking at him napoleon smiled

hes very young to come to meddle with us

youth is no hindrance to courage muttered sukhtelen in a failing
voice

a splendid reply said napoleon young man you will go far

prince andrew who had also been brought forward before the emperors
eyes to complete the show of prisoners could not fail to attract his
attention napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on the battlefield
and addressing him again used the epithet young man that was
connected in his memory with prince andrew

well and you young man said he how do you feel mon brave

though five minutes before prince andrew had been able to say a few
words to the soldiers who were carrying him now with his eyes fixed
straight on napoleon he was silent so insignificant at that moment
seemed to him all the interests that engrossed napoleon so mean did his
hero himself with his paltry vanity and joy in victory appear compared
to the lofty equitable and kindly sky which he had seen and
understood that he could not answer him

everything seemed so futile and insignificant in comparison with the
stern and solemn train of thought that weakness from loss of blood
suffering and the nearness of death aroused in him looking into
napoleons eyes prince andrew thought of the insignificance of
greatness the unimportance of life which no one could understand and
the still greater unimportance of death the meaning of which no one
alive could understand or explain

the emperor without waiting for an answer turned away and said to one of
the officers as he went have these gentlemen attended to and taken to
my bivouac let my doctor larrey examine their wounds au revoir
prince repnin and he spurred his horse and galloped away

his face shone with selfsatisfaction and pleasure

the soldiers who had carried prince andrew had noticed and taken the
little gold icon princess mary had hung round her brothers neck but
seeing the favor the emperor showed the prisoners they now hastened to
return the holy image

prince andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced but the
little icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his chest
outside his uniform

it would be good thought prince andrew glancing at the icon his
sister had hung round his neck with such emotion and reverence it
would be good if everything were as clear and simple as it seems to
mary how good it would be to know where to seek for help in this life
and what to expect after it beyond the grave how happy and calm i
should be if i could now say lord have mercy on me but to whom
should i say that either to a power indefinable incomprehensible
which i not only cannot address but which i cannot even express in
wordsthe great all or nothing said he to himself or to that god who
has been sewn into this amulet by mary there is nothing certain
nothing at all except the unimportance of everything i understand and
the greatness of something incomprehensible but allimportant

the stretchers moved on at every jolt he again felt unendurable pain
his feverishness increased and he grew delirious visions of his father
wife sister and future son and the tenderness he had felt the night
before the battle the figure of the insignificant little napoleon and
above all this the lofty sky formed the chief subjects of his delirious
fancies

the quiet home life and peaceful happiness of bald hills presented
itself to him he was already enjoying that happiness when that little
napoleon had suddenly appeared with his unsympathizing look of
shortsighted delight at the misery of others and doubts and torments
had followed and only the heavens promised peace toward morning all
these dreams melted and merged into the chaos and darkness of
unconciousness and oblivion which in the opinion of napoleons doctor
larrey was much more likely to end in death than in convalescence

he is a nervous bilious subject said larrey and will not recover

and prince andrew with others fatally wounded was left to the care of
the inhabitants of the district





book four





chapter i

early in the year  nicholas rostóv returned home on leave denisov
was going home to voronezh and rostóv persuaded him to travel with him
as far as moscow and to stay with him there meeting a comrade at the
last post station but one before moscow denisov had drunk three bottles
of wine with him and despite the jolting ruts across the snowcovered
road did not once wake up on the way to moscow but lay at the bottom
of the sleigh beside rostóv who grew more and more impatient the nearer
they got to moscow

how much longer how much longer oh these insufferable streets
shops bakers signboards street lamps and sleighs thought rostóv
when their leave permits had been passed at the town gate and they had
entered moscow

denisov were here hes asleep he added leaning forward with his
whole body as if in that position he hoped to hasten the speed of the
sleigh

denisov gave no answer

theres the corner at the crossroads where the cabman zakhar has his
stand and theres zakhar himself and still the same horse and heres
the little shop where we used to buy gingerbread cant you hurry up
now then

which house is it asked the driver

why that one right at the end the big one dont you see thats our
house said rostóv of course its our house denisov denisov were
almost there

denisov raised his head coughed and made no answer

dmítri said rostóv to his valet on the box those lights are in our
house arent they

yes sir and theres a light in your fathers study

then theyve not gone to bed yet what do you think mind now dont
forget to put out my new coat added rostóv fingering his new
mustache now then get on he shouted to the driver do wake up
vaska he went on turning to denisov whose head was again nodding
come get on you shall have three rubles for vodkaget on rostóv
shouted when the sleigh was only three houses from his door it seemed
to him the horses were not moving at all at last the sleigh bore to the
right drew up at an entrance and rostóv saw overhead the old familiar
cornice with a bit of plaster broken off the porch and the post by the
side of the pavement he sprang out before the sleigh stopped and ran
into the hall the house stood cold and silent as if quite regardless
of who had come to it there was no one in the hall oh god is
everyone all right he thought stopping for a moment with a sinking
heart and then immediately starting to run along the hall and up the
warped steps of the familiar staircase the wellknown old door handle
which always angered the countess when it was not properly cleaned
turned as loosely as ever a solitary tallow candle burned in the
anteroom

old michael was asleep on the chest prokofy the footman who was so
strong that he could lift the back of the carriage from behind sat
plaiting slippers out of cloth selvedges he looked up at the opening
door and his expression of sleepy indifference suddenly changed to one
of delighted amazement

gracious heavens the young count he cried recognizing his young
master can it be my treasure and prokofy trembling with
excitement rushed toward the drawing room door probably in order to
announce him but changing his mind came back and stooped to kiss the
young mans shoulder

all well asked rostóv drawing away his arm

yes god be thanked yes theyve just finished supper let me have a
look at you your excellency

is everything quite all right

the lord be thanked yes

rostóv who had completely forgotten denisov not wishing anyone to
forestall him threw off his fur coat and ran on tiptoe through the
large dark ballroom all was the same there were the same old card
tables and the same chandelier with a cover over it but someone had
already seen the young master and before he had reached the drawing
room something flew out from a side door like a tornado and began
hugging and kissing him another and yet another creature of the same
kind sprang from a second door and a third more hugging more kissing
more outcries and tears of joy he could not distinguish which was
papa which natásha and which pétya everyone shouted talked and
kissed him at the same time only his mother was not there he noticed
that

and i did not know nicholas my darling

here he is our own kolya  dear fellow how he has changed
where are the candles tea

 nicholas

and me kiss me

dearest and me

sónya natásha pétya anna mikháylovna véra and the old count were
all hugging him and the serfs men and maids flocked into the room
exclaiming and ohing and ahing

pétya clinging to his legs kept shouting and me too

natásha after she had pulled him down toward her and covered his face
with kisses holding him tight by the skirt of his coat sprang away and
pranced up and down in one place like a goat and shrieked piercingly

all around were loving eyes glistening with tears of joy and all around
were lips seeking a kiss

sónya too all rosy red clung to his arm and radiant with bliss
looked eagerly toward his eyes waiting for the look for which she
longed sónya now was sixteen and she was very pretty especially at
this moment of happy rapturous excitement she gazed at him not taking
her eyes off him and smiling and holding her breath he gave her a
grateful look but was still expectant and looking for someone the old
countess had not yet come but now steps were heard at the door steps
so rapid that they could hardly be his mothers

yet it was she dressed in a new gown which he did not know made since
he had left all the others let him go and he ran to her when they
met she fell on his breast sobbing she could not lift her face but
only pressed it to the cold braiding of his hussars jacket denisov
who had come into the room unnoticed by anyone stood there and wiped
his eyes at the sight

vasíli denisov your sons friend he said introducing himself to the
count who was looking inquiringly at him

you are most welcome i know i know said the count kissing and
embracing denisov nicholas wrote us natásha véra look here is
denisov

the same happy rapturous faces turned to the shaggy figure of denisov

darling denisov screamed natásha beside herself with rapture
springing to him putting her arms round him and kissing him this
escapade made everybody feel confused denisov blushed too but smiled
and taking natáshas hand kissed it

denisov was shown to the room prepared for him and the rostóvs all
gathered round nicholas in the sitting room

the old countess not letting go of his hand and kissing it every
moment sat beside him the rest crowding round him watched every
movement word or look of his never taking their blissfully adoring
eyes off him his brother and sisters struggled for the places nearest
to him and disputed with one another who should bring him his tea
handkerchief and pipe

rostóv was very happy in the love they showed him but the first moment
of meeting had been so beatific that his present joy seemed
insufficient and he kept expecting something more more and yet more

next morning after the fatigues of their journey the travelers slept
till ten oclock

in the room next their bedroom there was a confusion of sabers
satchels sabretaches open portmanteaus and dirty boots two freshly
cleaned pairs with spurs had just been placed by the wall the servants
were bringing in jugs and basins hot water for shaving and their well
brushed clothes there was a masculine odor and a smell of tobacco

hallo gwiskamy pipe came vasíli denisovs husky voice wostov get
up

rostóv rubbing his eyes that seemed glued together raised his
disheveled head from the hot pillow

why is it late

late its nearly ten oclock answered natáshas voice a rustle of
starched petticoats and the whispering and laughter of girls voices
came from the adjoining room the door was opened a crack and there was
a glimpse of something blue of ribbons black hair and merry faces it
was natásha sónya and pétya who had come to see whether they were
getting up

nicholas get up natáshas voice was again heard at the door

directly

meanwhile pétya having found and seized the sabers in the outer room
with the delight boys feel at the sight of a military elder brother and
forgetting that it was unbecoming for the girls to see men undressed
opened the bedroom door

is this your saber he shouted

the girls sprang aside denisov hid his hairy legs under the blanket
looking with a scared face at his comrade for help the door having let
pétya in closed again a sound of laughter came from behind it

nicholas come out in your dressing gown said natáshas voice

is this your saber asked pétya or is it yours he said addressing
the blackmustached denisov with servile deference

rostóv hurriedly put something on his feet drew on his dressing gown
and went out natásha had put on one spurred boot and was just getting
her foot into the other sónya when he came in was twirling round and
was about to expand her dresses into a balloon and sit down they were
dressed alike in new paleblue frocks and were both fresh rosy and
bright sónya ran away but natásha taking her brothers arm led him
into the sitting room where they began talking they hardly gave one
another time to ask questions and give replies concerning a thousand
little matters which could not interest anyone but themselves natásha
laughed at every word he said or that she said herself not because what
they were saying was amusing but because she felt happy and was unable
to control her joy which expressed itself by laughter

oh how nice how splendid she said to everything

rostóv felt that under the influence of the warm rays of love that
childlike smile which had not once appeared on his face since he left
home now for the first time after eighteen months again brightened his
soul and his face

no but listen she said now you are quite a man arent you im
awfully glad youre my brother she touched his mustache i want to
know what you men are like are you the same as we no

why did sónya run away asked rostóv

ah yes thats a whole long story how are you going to speak to
herthou or you

as may happen said rostóv

no call her you please ill tell you all about it some other time
no ill tell you now you know sónyas my dearest friend such a friend
that i burned my arm for her sake look here

she pulled up her muslin sleeve and showed him a red scar on her long
slender delicate arm high above the elbow on that part that is covered
even by a ball dress

i burned this to prove my love for her i just heated a ruler in the
fire and pressed it there

sitting on the sofa with the little cushions on its arms in what used
to be his old schoolroom and looking into natáshas wildly bright eyes
rostóv reentered that world of home and childhood which had no meaning
for anyone else but gave him some of the best joys of his life and the
burning of an arm with a ruler as a proof of love did not seem to him
senseless he understood and was not surprised at it

well and is that all he asked

we are such friends such friends all that ruler business was just
nonsense but we are friends forever she if she loves anyone does it
for life but i dont understand that i forget quickly

well what then

well she loves me and you like that

natásha suddenly flushed

why you remember before you went away well she says you are to
forget all that she says i shall love him always but let him be
free isnt that lovely and noble yes very noble isnt it asked
natásha so seriously and excitedly that it was evident that what she
was now saying she had talked of before with tears

rostóv became thoughtful

i never go back on my word he said besides sónya is so charming
that only a fool would renounce such happiness

no no cried natásha she and i have already talked it over we knew
youd say so but it wont do because you see if you say thatif you
consider yourself bound by your promiseit will seem as if she had not
meant it seriously it makes it as if you were marrying her because you
must and that wouldnt do at all

rostóv saw that it had been well considered by them sónya had already
struck him by her beauty on the preceding day today when he had caught
a glimpse of her she seemed still more lovely she was a charming girl
of sixteen evidently passionately in love with him he did not doubt
that for an instant why should he not love her now and even marry
her rostóv thought but just now there were so many other pleasures and
interests before him yes they have taken a wise decision he
thought i must remain free

well then thats excellent said he well talk it over later on
oh how glad i am to have you

well and are you still true to borís he continued

oh what nonsense cried natásha laughing i dont think about him
or anyone else and i dont want anything of the kind

dear me then what are you up to now

now repeated natásha and a happy smile lit up her face have you
seen duport

no

not seen duportthe famous dancer well then you wont understand
thats what im up to

curving her arms natásha held out her skirts as dancers do ran back a
few steps turned cut a caper brought her little feet sharply
together and made some steps on the very tips of her toes

see im standing see she said but could not maintain herself on
her toes any longer so thats what im up to ill never marry anyone
but will be a dancer only dont tell anyone

rostóv laughed so loud and merrily that denisov in his bedroom felt
envious and natásha could not help joining in

no but dont you think its nice she kept repeating

nice and so you no longer wish to marry borís

natásha flared up i dont want to marry anyone and ill tell him so
when i see him

dear me said rostóv

but thats all rubbish natásha chattered on and is denisov nice
she asked

yes indeed

oh well then goodby go and dress is he very terrible denisov

why terrible asked nicholas no vaska is a splendid fellow

you call him vaska thats funny and is he very nice

very

well then be quick well all have breakfast together

and natásha rose and went out of the room on tiptoe like a ballet
dancer but smiling as only happy girls of fifteen can smile when
rostóv met sónya in the drawing room he reddened he did not know how
to behave with her the evening before in the first happy moment of
meeting they had kissed each other but today they felt it could not be
done he felt that everybody including his mother and sisters was
looking inquiringly at him and watching to see how he would behave with
her he kissed her hand and addressed her not as thou but as yousónya
but their eyes met and said thou and exchanged tender kisses her looks
asked him to forgive her for having dared by natáshas intermediacy to
remind him of his promise and then thanked him for his love his looks
thanked her for offering him his freedom and told her that one way or
another he would never cease to love her for that would be impossible

how strange it is said véra selecting a moment when all were silent
that sónya and nicholas now say you to one another and meet like
strangers

véras remark was correct as her remarks always were but like most of
her observations it made everyone feel uncomfortable not only sónya
nicholas and natásha but even the old countess whodreading this love
affair which might hinder nicholas from making a brilliant matchblushed
like a girl

denisov to rostóvs surprise appeared in the drawing room with pomaded
hair perfumed and in a new uniform looking just as smart as he made
himself when going into battle and he was more amiable to the ladies
and gentlemen than rostóv had ever expected to see him





chapter ii

on his return to moscow from the army nicholas rostóv was welcomed by
his home circle as the best of sons a hero and their darling
nikolenka by his relations as a charming attractive and polite young
man by his acquaintances as a handsome lieutenant of hussars a good
dancer and one of the best matches in the city

the rostóvs knew everybody in moscow the old count had money enough
that year as all his estates had been remortgaged and so nicholas
acquiring a trotter of his own very stylish riding breeches of the
latest cut such as no one else yet had in moscow and boots of the
latest fashion with extremely pointed toes and small silver spurs
passed his time very gaily after a short period of adapting himself to
the old conditions of life nicholas found it very pleasant to be at
home again he felt that he had grown up and matured very much his
despair at failing in a scripture examination his borrowing money from
gavril to pay a sleigh driver his kissing sónya on the slyhe now
recalled all this as childishness he had left immeasurably behind now
he was a lieutenant of hussars in a jacket laced with silver and
wearing the cross of st george awarded to soldiers for bravery in
action and in the company of wellknown elderly and respected racing
men was training a trotter of his own for a race he knew a lady on one
of the boulevards whom he visited of an evening he led the mazurka at
the arkhárovs ball talked about the war with field marshal kamenski
visited the english club and was on intimate terms with a colonel of
forty to whom denisov had introduced him

his passion for the emperor had cooled somewhat in moscow but still as
he did not see him and had no opportunity of seeing him he often spoke
about him and about his love for him letting it be understood that he
had not told all and that there was something in his feelings for the
emperor not everyone could understand and with his whole soul he shared
the adoration then common in moscow for the emperor who was spoken of
as the angel incarnate

during rostóvs short stay in moscow before rejoining the army he did
not draw closer to sónya but rather drifted away from her she was very
pretty and sweet and evidently deeply in love with him but he was at
the period of youth when there seems so much to do that there is no time
for that sort of thing and a young man fears to bind himself and prizes
his freedom which he needs for so many other things when he thought of
sónya during this stay in moscow he said to himself ah there will
be and there are many more such girls somewhere whom i do not yet
know there will be time enough to think about love when i want to but
now i have no time besides it seemed to him that the society of women
was rather derogatory to his manhood he went to balls and into ladies
society with an affectation of doing so against his will the races the
english club sprees with denisov and visits to a certain housethat
was another matter and quite the thing for a dashing young hussar

at the beginning of march old count ilyá rostóv was very busy arranging
a dinner in honor of prince bagration at the english club

the count walked up and down the hall in his dressing gown giving
orders to the club steward and to the famous feoktist the clubs head
cook about asparagus fresh cucumbers strawberries veal and fish for
this dinner the count had been a member and on the committee of the
club from the day it was founded to him the club entrusted the
arrangement of the festival in honor of bagration for few men knew so
well how to arrange a feast on an openhanded hospitable scale and
still fewer men would be so well able and willing to make up out of
their own resources what might be needed for the success of the fete
the club cook and the steward listened to the counts orders with
pleased faces for they knew that under no other management could they
so easily extract a good profit for themselves from a dinner costing
several thousand rubles

well then mind and have cocks comb in the turtle soup you know

shall we have three cold dishes then asked the cook

the count considered

we cant have lessyes three the mayonnaise thats one said he
bending down a finger

then am i to order those large sterlets asked the steward

yes it cant be helped if they wont take less ah dear me i was
forgetting we must have another entree ah goodness gracious he
clutched at his head who is going to get me the flowers dmítri eh
dmítri gallop off to our moscow estate he said to the factotum who
appeared at his call hurry off and tell maksim the gardener to set
the serfs to work say that everything out of the hothouses must be
brought here well wrapped up in felt i must have two hundred pots here
on friday

having given several more orders he was about to go to his little
countess to have a rest but remembering something else of importance
he returned again called back the cook and the club steward and again
began giving orders a light footstep and the clinking of spurs were
heard at the door and the young count handsome rosy with a dark
little mustache evidently rested and made sleeker by his easy life in
moscow entered the room

ah my boy my heads in a whirl said the old man with a smile as if
he felt a little confused before his son now if you would only help a
bit i must have singers too i shall have my own orchestra but
shouldnt we get the gypsy singers as well you military men like that
sort of thing

really papa i believe prince bagration worried himself less before
the battle of schon grabern than you do now said his son with a smile

the old count pretended to be angry

yes you talk but try it yourself

and the count turned to the cook who with a shrewd and respectful
expression looked observantly and sympathetically at the father and
son

what have the young people come to nowadays eh feoktist said he
laughing at us old fellows

thats so your excellency all they have to do is to eat a good
dinner but providing it and serving it all up thats not their
business

thats it thats it exclaimed the count and gaily seizing his son
by both hands he cried now ive got you so take the sleigh and pair
at once and go to bezúkhovs and tell him count ilyá has sent you to
ask for strawberries and fresh pineapples we cant get them from
anyone else hes not there himself so youll have to go in and ask the
princesses and from there go on to the rasgulyaythe coachman ipatka
knowsand look up the gypsy ilyushka the one who danced at count
orlóvs you remember in a white cossack coat and bring him along to
me

and am i to bring the gypsy girls along with him asked nicholas
laughing dear dear

at that moment with noiseless footsteps and with the businesslike
preoccupied yet meekly christian look which never left her face anna
mikháylovna entered the hall though she came upon the count in his
dressing gown every day he invariably became confused and begged her to
excuse his costume

no matter at all my dear count she said meekly closing her eyes
but ill go to bezúkhovs myself pierre has arrived and now we shall
get anything we want from his hothouses i have to see him in any case
he has forwarded me a letter from borís thank god borís is now on the
staff

the count was delighted at anna mikháylovnas taking upon herself one of
his commissions and ordered the small closed carriage for her

tell bezúkhov to come ill put his name down is his wife with him
he asked

anna mikháylovna turned up her eyes and profound sadness was depicted
on her face

ah my dear friend he is very unfortunate she said if what we hear
is true it is dreadful how little we dreamed of such a thing when we
were rejoicing at his happiness and such a lofty angelic soul as young
bezúkhov yes i pity him from my heart and shall try to give him what
consolation i can

whwhat is the matter asked both the young and old rostóv

anna mikháylovna sighed deeply

dólokhov mary ivánovnas son she said in a mysterious whisper has
compromised her completely they say pierre took him up invited him to
his house in petersburg and now she has come here and that daredevil
after her said anna mikháylovna wishing to show her sympathy for
pierre but by involuntary intonations and a half smile betraying her
sympathy for the daredevil as she called dólokhov they say pierre
is quite broken by his misfortune

dear dear but still tell him to come to the clubit will all blow
over it will be a tremendous banquet

next day the third of march soon after one oclock two hundred and
fifty members of the english club and fifty guests were awaiting the
guest of honor and hero of the austrian campaign prince bagration to
dinner

on the first arrival of the news of the battle of austerlitz moscow had
been bewildered at that time the russians were so used to victories
that on receiving news of the defeat some would simply not believe it
while others sought some extraordinary explanation of so strange an
event in the english club where all who were distinguished important
and well informed foregathered when the news began to arrive in
december nothing was said about the war and the last battle as though
all were in a conspiracy of silence the men who set the tone in
conversationcount rostopchin prince yuri dolgorukov valuev count
markov and prince vyazemskidid not show themselves at the club but
met in private houses in intimate circles and the moscovites who took
their opinions from othersilyá rostóv among themremained for a while
without any definite opinion on the subject of the war and without
leaders the moscovites felt that something was wrong and that to
discuss the bad news was difficult and so it was best to be silent but
after a while just as a jury comes out of its room the bigwigs who
guided the clubs opinion reappeared and everybody began speaking
clearly and definitely reasons were found for the incredible unheard
of and impossible event of a russian defeat everything became clear
and in all corners of moscow the same things began to be said these
reasons were the treachery of the austrians a defective commissariat
the treachery of the pole przebyszewski and of the frenchman langeron
kutúzovs incapacity and it was whispered the youth and inexperience
of the sovereign who had trusted worthless and insignificant people
but the army the russian army everyone declared was extraordinary and
had achieved miracles of valor the soldiers officers and generals
were heroes but the hero of heroes was prince bagration distinguished
by his schon grabern affair and by the retreat from austerlitz where he
alone had withdrawn his column unbroken and had all day beaten back an
enemy force twice as numerous as his own what also conduced to
bagrations being selected as moscows hero was the fact that he had no
connections in the city and was a stranger there in his person honor
was shown to a simple fighting russian soldier without connections and
intrigues and to one who was associated by memories of the italian
campaign with the name of suvórov moreover paying such honor to
bagration was the best way of expressing disapproval and dislike of
kutúzov

had there been no bagration it would have been necessary to invent
him said the wit shinshín parodying the words of voltaire kutúzov no
one spoke of except some who abused him in whispers calling him a
court weathercock and an old satyr

all moscow repeated prince dolgorukovs saying if you go on modeling
and modeling you must get smeared with clay suggesting consolation for
our defeat by the memory of former victories and the words of
rostopchin that french soldiers have to be incited to battle by
highfalutin words and germans by logical arguments to show them that it
is more dangerous to run away than to advance but that russian soldiers
only need to be restrained and held back on all sides new and fresh
anecdotes were heard of individual examples of heroism shown by our
officers and men at austerlitz one had saved a standard another had
killed five frenchmen a third had loaded five cannon singlehanded berg
was mentioned by those who did not know him as having when wounded in
the right hand taken his sword in the left and gone forward of
bolkónski nothing was said and only those who knew him intimately
regretted that he had died so young leaving a pregnant wife with his
eccentric father





chapter iii

on that third of march all the rooms in the english club were filled
with a hum of conversation like the hum of bees swarming in springtime
the members and guests of the club wandered hither and thither sat
stood met and separated some in uniform and some in evening dress
and a few here and there with powdered hair and in russian kaftans
powdered footmen in livery with buckled shoes and smart stockings
stood at every door anxiously noting visitors every movement in order
to offer their services most of those present were elderly respected
men with broad selfconfident faces fat fingers and resolute gestures
and voices this class of guests and members sat in certain habitual
places and met in certain habitual groups a minority of those present
were casual guestschiefly young men among whom were denisov rostóv
and dólokhovwho was now again an officer in the semënov regiment the
faces of these young people especially those who were military men
bore that expression of condescending respect for their elders which
seems to say to the older generation we are prepared to respect and
honor you but all the same remember that the future belongs to us

nesvitski was there as an old member of the club pierre who at his
wifes command had let his hair grow and abandoned his spectacles went
about the rooms fashionably dressed but looking sad and dull here as
elsewhere he was surrounded by an atmosphere of subservience to his
wealth and being in the habit of lording it over these people he
treated them with absentminded contempt

by his age he should have belonged to the younger men but by his wealth
and connections he belonged to the groups of old and honored guests and
so he went from one group to another some of the most important old men
were the center of groups which even strangers approached respectfully
to hear the voices of wellknown men the largest circles formed round
count rostopchin valuev and naryshkin rostopchin was describing how
the russians had been overwhelmed by flying austrians and had had to
force their way through them with bayonets

valuev was confidentially telling that uvarov had been sent from
petersburg to ascertain what moscow was thinking about austerlitz

in the third circle naryshkin was speaking of the meeting of the
austrian council of war at which suvórov crowed like a cock in reply to
the nonsense talked by the austrian generals shinshín standing close
by tried to make a joke saying that kutúzov had evidently failed to
learn from suvórov even so simple a thing as the art of crowing like a
cock but the elder members glanced severely at the wit making him feel
that in that place and on that day it was improper to speak so of
kutúzov

count ilyá rostóv hurried and preoccupied went about in his soft boots
between the dining and drawing rooms hastily greeting the important and
unimportant all of whom he knew as if they were all equals while his
eyes occasionally sought out his fine wellsetup young son resting on
him and winking joyfully at him young rostóv stood at a window with
dólokhov whose acquaintance he had lately made and highly valued the
old count came up to them and pressed dólokhovs hand

please come and visit us you know my brave boy been together out
there both playing the hero ah vasíli ignatovich how dye do
old fellow he said turning to an old man who was passing but before
he had finished his greeting there was a general stir and a footman who
had run in announced with a frightened face hes arrived

bells rang the stewards rushed forward andlike rye shaken together in
a shovelthe guests who had been scattered about in different rooms came
together and crowded in the large drawing room by the door of the
ballroom

bagration appeared in the doorway of the anteroom without hat or sword
which in accord with the club custom he had given up to the hall
porter he had no lambskin cap on his head nor had he a loaded whip
over his shoulder as when rostóv had seen him on the eve of the battle
of austerlitz but wore a tight new uniform with russian and foreign
orders and the star of st george on his left breast evidently just
before coming to the dinner he had had his hair and whiskers trimmed
which changed his appearance for the worse there was something naïvely
festive in his air which in conjunction with his firm and virile
features gave him a rather comical expression bekleshev and theodore
uvarov who had arrived with him paused at the doorway to allow him as
the guest of honor to enter first bagration was embarrassed not
wishing to avail himself of their courtesy and this caused some delay
at the doors but after all he did at last enter first he walked shyly
and awkwardly over the parquet floor of the reception room not knowing
what to do with his hands he was more accustomed to walk over a plowed
field under fire as he had done at the head of the kursk regiment at
schon grabernand he would have found that easier the committeemen met
him at the first door and expressing their delight at seeing such a
highly honored guest took possession of him as it were without waiting
for his reply surrounded him and led him to the drawing room it was
at first impossible to enter the drawing room door for the crowd of
members and guests jostling one another and trying to get a good look at
bagration over each others shoulders as if he were some rare animal
count ilyá rostóv laughing and repeating the words make way dear
boy make way make way pushed through the crowd more energetically
than anyone led the guests into the drawing room and seated them on
the center sofa the bigwigs the most respected members of the club
beset the new arrivals count ilyá again thrusting his way through the
crowd went out of the drawing room and reappeared a minute later with
another committeeman carrying a large silver salver which he presented
to prince bagration on the salver lay some verses composed and printed
in the heros honor bagration on seeing the salver glanced around in
dismay as though seeking help but all eyes demanded that he should
submit feeling himself in their power he resolutely took the salver
with both hands and looked sternly and reproachfully at the count who
had presented it to him someone obligingly took the dish from bagration
or he would it seemed have held it till evening and have gone in to
dinner with it and drew his attention to the verses

well i will read them then bagration seemed to say and fixing his
weary eyes on the paper began to read them with a fixed and serious
expression but the author himself took the verses and began reading
them aloud bagration bowed his head and listened

bring glory then to alexanders reign and on the throne our titus
shield a dreaded foe be thou kindhearted as a man a rhipheus at home
a caesar in the field een fortunate napoleon knows by experience now
bagration and dare not herculean russians trouble

but before he had finished reading a stentorian majordomo announced
that dinner was ready the door opened and from the dining room came
the resounding strains of the polonaise

conquests joyful thunder waken triumph valiant russians now

and count rostóv glancing angrily at the author who went on reading his
verses bowed to bagration everyone rose feeling that dinner was more
important than verses and bagration again preceding all the rest went
in to dinner he was seated in the place of honor between two
alexandersbekleshev and naryshkinwhich was a significant allusion to
the name of the sovereign three hundred persons took their seats in the
dining room according to their rank and importance the more important
nearer to the honored guest as naturally as water flows deepest where
the land lies lowest

just before dinner count ilyá rostóv presented his son to bagration
who recognized him and said a few words to him disjointed and awkward
as were all the words he spoke that day and count ilyá looked joyfully
and proudly around while bagration spoke to his son

nicholas rostóv with denisov and his new acquaintance dólokhov sat
almost at the middle of the table facing them sat pierre beside prince
nesvitski count ilyá rostóv with the other members of the committee sat
facing bagration and as the very personification of moscow hospitality
did the honors to the prince

his efforts had not been in vain the dinner both the lenten and the
other fare was splendid yet he could not feel quite at ease till the
end of the meal he winked at the butler whispered directions to the
footmen and awaited each expected dish with some anxiety everything
was excellent with the second course a gigantic sterlet at sight of
which ilyá rostóv blushed with selfconscious pleasure the footmen
began popping corks and filling the champagne glasses after the fish
which made a certain sensation the count exchanged glances with the
other committeemen there will be many toasts its time to begin he
whispered and taking up his glass he rose all were silent waiting
for what he would say

to the health of our sovereign the emperor he cried and at the same
moment his kindly eyes grew moist with tears of joy and enthusiasm the
band immediately struck up conquests joyful thunder waken all rose
and cried hurrah bagration also rose and shouted hurrah in exactly
the same voice in which he had shouted it on the field at schon grabern
young rostóvs ecstatic voice could be heard above the three hundred
others he nearly wept to the health of our sovereign the emperor
he roared hurrah and emptying his glass at one gulp he dashed it to
the floor many followed his example and the loud shouting continued
for a long time when the voices subsided the footmen cleared away the
broken glass and everybody sat down again smiling at the noise they had
made and exchanging remarks the old count rose once more glanced at a
note lying beside his plate and proposed a toast to the health of the
hero of our last campaign prince peter ivánovich bagration and again
his blue eyes grew moist hurrah cried the three hundred voices
again but instead of the band a choir began singing a cantata composed
by paul ivánovich kutúzov

russians oer all barriers on courage conquest guarantees have we not
bagration he brings foe men to their knees etc

as soon as the singing was over another and another toast was proposed
and count ilyá rostóv became more and more moved more glass was
smashed and the shouting grew louder they drank to bekleshev
naryshkin uvarov dolgorukov apráksin valuev to the committee to
all the club members and to all the club guests and finally to count
ilyá rostóv separately as the organizer of the banquet at that toast
the count took out his handkerchief and covering his face wept
outright





chapter iv

pierre sat opposite dólokhov and nicholas rostóv as usual he ate and
drank much and eagerly but those who knew him intimately noticed that
some great change had come over him that day he was silent all through
dinner and looked about blinking and scowling or with fixed eyes and
a look of complete absentmindedness kept rubbing the bridge of his
nose his face was depressed and gloomy he seemed to see and hear
nothing of what was going on around him and to be absorbed by some
depressing and unsolved problem

the unsolved problem that tormented him was caused by hints given by the
princess his cousin at moscow concerning dólokhovs intimacy with his
wife and by an anonymous letter he had received that morning which in
the mean jocular way common to anonymous letters said that he saw badly
through his spectacles but that his wifes connection with dólokhov was
a secret to no one but himself pierre absolutely disbelieved both the
princess hints and the letter but he feared now to look at dólokhov
who was sitting opposite him every time he chanced to meet dólokhovs
handsome insolent eyes pierre felt something terrible and monstrous
rising in his soul and turned quickly away involuntarily recalling his
wifes past and her relations with dólokhov pierre saw clearly that
what was said in the letter might be true or might at least seem to be
true had it not referred to his wife he involuntarily remembered how
dólokhov who had fully recovered his former position after the
campaign had returned to petersburg and come to him availing himself
of his friendly relations with pierre as a boon companion dólokhov had
come straight to his house and pierre had put him up and lent him
money pierre recalled how hélène had smilingly expressed disapproval of
dólokhovs living at their house and how cynically dólokhov had praised
his wifes beauty to him and from that time till they came to moscow had
not left them for a day

yes he is very handsome thought pierre and i know him it would be
particularly pleasant to him to dishonor my name and ridicule me just
because i have exerted myself on his behalf befriended him and helped
him i know and understand what a spice that would add to the pleasure
of deceiving me if it really were true yes if it were true but i do
not believe it i have no right to and cant believe it he
remembered the expression dólokhovs face assumed in his moments of
cruelty as when tying the policeman to the bear and dropping them into
the water or when he challenged a man to a duel without any reason or
shot a postboys horse with a pistol that expression was often on
dólokhovs face when looking at him yes he is a bully thought
pierre to kill a man means nothing to him it must seem to him that
everyone is afraid of him and that must please him he must think that
i too am afraid of himand in fact i am afraid of him he thought
and again he felt something terrible and monstrous rising in his soul
dólokhov denisov and rostóv were now sitting opposite pierre and
seemed very gay rostóv was talking merrily to his two friends one of
whom was a dashing hussar and the other a notorious duelist and rake
and every now and then he glanced ironically at pierre whose
preoccupied absentminded and massive figure was a very noticeable one
at the dinner rostóv looked inimically at pierre first because pierre
appeared to his hussar eyes as a rich civilian the husband of a beauty
and in a wordan old woman and secondly because pierre in his
preoccupation and absentmindedness had not recognized rostóv and had
not responded to his greeting when the emperors health was drunk
pierre lost in thought did not rise or lift his glass

what are you about shouted rostóv looking at him in an ecstasy of
exasperation dont you hear its his majesty the emperors health

pierre sighed rose submissively emptied his glass and waiting till
all were seated again turned with his kindly smile to rostóv

why i didnt recognize you he said but rostóv was otherwise
engaged he was shouting hurrah

why dont you renew the acquaintance said dólokhov to rostóv

confound him hes a fool said rostóv

one should make up to the husbands of pretty women said denisov

pierre did not catch what they were saying but knew they were talking
about him he reddened and turned away

well now to the health of handsome women said dólokhov and with a
serious expression but with a smile lurking at the corners of his
mouth he turned with his glass to pierre

heres to the health of lovely women peterkinand their lovers he
added

pierre with downcast eyes drank out of his glass without looking at
dólokhov or answering him the footman who was distributing leaflets
with kutúzovs cantata laid one before pierre as one of the principal
guests he was just going to take it when dólokhov leaning across
snatched it from his hand and began reading it pierre looked at
dólokhov and his eyes dropped the something terrible and monstrous that
had tormented him all dinnertime rose and took possession of him he
leaned his whole massive body across the table

how dare you take it he shouted

hearing that cry and seeing to whom it was addressed nesvitski and the
neighbor on his right quickly turned in alarm to bezúkhov

dont dont what are you about whispered their frightened voices

dólokhov looked at pierre with clear mirthful cruel eyes and that
smile of his which seemed to say ah this is what i like

you shant have it he said distinctly

pale with quivering lips pierre snatched the copy

you you scoundrel i challenge you he ejaculated and pushing
back his chair he rose from the table

at the very instant he did this and uttered those words pierre felt
that the question of his wifes guilt which had been tormenting him the
whole day was finally and indubitably answered in the affirmative he
hated her and was forever sundered from her despite denisovs request
that he would take no part in the matter rostóv agreed to be dólokhovs
second and after dinner he discussed the arrangements for the duel with
nesvitski bezúkhovs second pierre went home but rostóv with dólokhov
and denisov stayed on at the club till late listening to the gypsies
and other singers

well then till tomorrow at sokolniki said dólokhov as he took leave
of rostóv in the club porch

and do you feel quite calm rostóv asked

dólokhov paused

well you see ill tell you the whole secret of dueling in two words
if you are going to fight a duel and you make a will and write
affectionate letters to your parents and if you think you may be
killed you are a fool and are lost for certain but go with the firm
intention of killing your man as quickly and surely as possible and
then all will be right as our bear huntsman at kostroma used to tell
me everyone fears a bear he says but when you see one your fears
all gone and your only thought is not to let him get away and thats
how it is with me a demain mon cher

 till tomorrow my dear fellow

next day at eight in the morning pierre and nesvitski drove to the
sokolniki forest and found dólokhov denisov and rostóv already there
pierre had the air of a man preoccupied with considerations which had no
connection with the matter in hand his haggard face was yellow he had
evidently not slept that night he looked about distractedly and screwed
up his eyes as if dazzled by the sun he was entirely absorbed by two
considerations his wifes guilt of which after his sleepless night he
had not the slightest doubt and the guiltlessness of dólokhov who had
no reason to preserve the honor of a man who was nothing to him i
should perhaps have done the same thing in his place thought pierre
its even certain that i should have done the same then why this duel
this murder either i shall kill him or he will hit me in the head or
elbow or knee cant i go away from here run away bury myself
somewhere passed through his mind but just at moments when such
thoughts occurred to him he would ask in a particularly calm and
absentminded way which inspired the respect of the onlookers will it
be long are things ready

when all was ready the sabers stuck in the snow to mark the barriers
and the pistols loaded nesvitski went up to pierre

i should not be doing my duty count he said in timid tones and
should not justify your confidence and the honor you have done me in
choosing me for your second if at this grave this very grave moment i
did not tell you the whole truth i think there is no sufficient ground
for this affair or for blood to be shed over it you were not right
not quite in the right you were impetuous

oh yes it is horribly stupid said pierre

then allow me to express your regrets and i am sure your opponent will
accept them said nesvitski who like the others concerned in the
affair and like everyone in similar cases did not yet believe that the
affair had come to an actual duel you know count it is much more
honorable to admit ones mistake than to let matters become irreparable
there was no insult on either side allow me to convey

no what is there to talk about said pierre its all the same
is everything ready he added only tell me where to go and where to
shoot he said with an unnaturally gentle smile

he took the pistol in his hand and began asking about the working of the
trigger as he had not before held a pistol in his handa fact that he
did not wish to confess

oh yes like that i know i only forgot said he

no apologies none whatever said dólokhov to denisov who on his side
had been attempting a reconciliation and he also went up to the
appointed place

the spot chosen for the duel was some eighty paces from the road where
the sleighs had been left in a small clearing in the pine forest
covered with melting snow the frost having begun to break up during the
last few days the antagonists stood forty paces apart at the farther
edge of the clearing the seconds measuring the paces left tracks in
the deep wet snow between the place where they had been standing and
nesvitskis and dólokhovs sabers which were stuck into the ground ten
paces apart to mark the barrier it was thawing and misty at forty
paces distance nothing could be seen for three minutes all had been
ready but they still delayed and all were silent





chapter v

well begin said dólokhov

all right said pierre still smiling in the same way a feeling of
dread was in the air it was evident that the affair so lightly begun
could no longer be averted but was taking its course independently of
mens will

denisov first went to the barrier and announced as the advesawies
have wefused a weconciliation please pwoceed take your pistols and at
the word thwee begin to advance

one two thwee he shouted angrily and stepped aside

the combatants advanced along the trodden tracks nearer and nearer to
one another beginning to see one another through the mist they had the
right to fire when they liked as they approached the barrier dólokhov
walked slowly without raising his pistol looking intently with his
bright sparkling blue eyes into his antagonists face his mouth wore
its usual semblance of a smile

so i can fire when i like said pierre and at the word three he
went quickly forward missing the trodden path and stepping into the
deep snow he held the pistol in his right hand at arms length
apparently afraid of shooting himself with it his left hand he held
carefully back because he wished to support his right hand with it and
knew he must not do so having advanced six paces and strayed off the
track into the snow pierre looked down at his feet then quickly
glanced at dólokhov and bending his finger as he had been shown fired
not at all expecting so loud a report pierre shuddered at the sound and
then smiling at his own sensations stood still the smoke rendered
denser by the mist prevented him from seeing anything for an instant
but there was no second report as he had expected he only heard
dólokhovs hurried steps and his figure came in view through the smoke
he was pressing one hand to his left side while the other clutched his
drooping pistol his face was pale rostóv ran toward him and said
something

nooo muttered dólokhov through his teeth no its not over and
after stumbling a few staggering steps right up to the saber he sank on
the snow beside it his left hand was bloody he wiped it on his coat
and supported himself with it his frowning face was pallid and
quivered

plea began dólokhov but could not at first pronounce the word

please he uttered with an effort

pierre hardly restraining his sobs began running toward dólokhov and
was about to cross the space between the barriers when dólokhov cried

to your barrier and pierre grasping what was meant stopped by his
saber only ten paces divided them dólokhov lowered his head to the
snow greedily bit at it again raised his head adjusted himself drew
in his legs and sat up seeking a firm center of gravity he sucked and
swallowed the cold snow his lips quivered but his eyes still smiling
glittered with effort and exasperation as he mustered his remaining
strength he raised his pistol and aimed

sideways cover yourself with your pistol ejaculated nesvitski

cover yourself even denisov cried to his adversary

pierre with a gentle smile of pity and remorse his arms and legs
helplessly spread out stood with his broad chest directly facing
dólokhov looked sorrowfully at him denisov rostóv and nesvitski
closed their eyes at the same instant they heard a report and
dólokhovs angry cry

missed shouted dólokhov and he lay helplessly face downwards on the
snow

pierre clutched his temples and turning round went into the forest
trampling through the deep snow and muttering incoherent words

folly folly death lies he repeated puckering his face

nesvitski stopped him and took him home

rostóv and denisov drove away with the wounded dólokhov

the latter lay silent in the sleigh with closed eyes and did not answer
a word to the questions addressed to him but on entering moscow he
suddenly came to and lifting his head with an effort took rostóv who
was sitting beside him by the hand rostóv was struck by the totally
altered and unexpectedly rapturous and tender expression on dólokhovs
face

well how do you feel he asked

bad but its not that my friend said dólokhov with a gasping voice
where are we in moscow i know i dont matter but i have killed her
killed she wont get over it she wont survive

who asked rostóv

my mother my mother my angel my adored angel mother and dólokhov
pressed rostóvs hand and burst into tears

when he had become a little quieter he explained to rostóv that he was
living with his mother who if she saw him dying would not survive it
he implored rostóv to go on and prepare her

rostóv went on ahead to do what was asked and to his great surprise
learned that dólokhov the brawler dólokhov the bully lived in moscow
with an old mother and a hunchback sister and was the most affectionate
of sons and brothers





chapter vi

pierre had of late rarely seen his wife alone both in petersburg and in
moscow their house was always full of visitors the night after the duel
he did not go to his bedroom but as he often did remained in his
fathers room that huge room in which count bezúkhov had died

he lay down on the sofa meaning to fall asleep and forget all that had
happened to him but could not do so such a storm of feelings
thoughts and memories suddenly arose within him that he could not fall
asleep nor even remain in one place but had to jump up and pace the
room with rapid steps now he seemed to see her in the early days of
their marriage with bare shoulders and a languid passionate look on
her face and then immediately he saw beside her dólokhovs handsome
insolent hard and mocking face as he had seen it at the banquet and
then that same face pale quivering and suffering as it had been when
he reeled and sank on the snow

what has happened he asked himself i have killed her lover yes
killed my wifes lover yes that was it and why how did i come to do
itbecause you married her answered an inner voice

but in what was i to blame he asked in marrying her without loving
her in deceiving yourself and her and he vividly recalled that moment
after supper at prince vasílis when he spoke those words he had found
so difficult to utter i love you it all comes from that even then
i felt it he thought i felt then that it was not so that i had no
right to do it and so it turns out

he remembered his honeymoon and blushed at the recollection
particularly vivid humiliating and shameful was the recollection of
how one day soon after his marriage he came out of the bedroom into his
study a little before noon in his silk dressing gown and found his head
steward there who bowing respectfully looked into his face and at his
dressing gown and smiled slightly as if expressing respectful
understanding of his employers happiness

but how often i have felt proud of her proud of her majestic beauty
and social tact thought he been proud of my house in which she
received all petersburg proud of her unapproachability and beauty so
this is what i was proud of i then thought that i did not understand
her how often when considering her character i have told myself that i
was to blame for not understanding her for not understanding that
constant composure and complacency and lack of all interests or desires
and the whole secret lies in the terrible truth that she is a depraved
woman now i have spoken that terrible word to myself all has become
clear

anatole used to come to borrow money from her and used to kiss her
naked shoulders she did not give him the money but let herself be
kissed her father in jest tried to rouse her jealousy and she replied
with a calm smile that she was not so stupid as to be jealous let him
do what he pleases she used to say of me one day i asked her if she
felt any symptoms of pregnancy she laughed contemptuously and said she
was not a fool to want to have children and that she was not going to
have any children by me

then he recalled the coarseness and bluntness of her thoughts and the
vulgarity of the expressions that were natural to her though she had
been brought up in the most aristocratic circles

im not such a fool just you try it on allezvous promener
she used to say often seeing the success she had with young and old men
and women pierre could not understand why he did not love her

 you clear out of this

yes i never loved her said he to himself i knew she was a depraved
woman he repeated but dared not admit it to myself and now theres
dólokhov sitting in the snow with a forced smile and perhaps dying
while meeting my remorse with some forced bravado

pierre was one of those people who in spite of an appearance of what is
called weak character do not seek a confidant in their troubles he
digested his sufferings alone

it is all all her fault he said to himself but what of that why
did i bind myself to her why did i say je vous aime  to her which
was a lie and worse than a lie i am guilty and must endure what a
slur on my name a misfortune for life oh thats nonsense he
thought the slur on my name and honorthats all apart from myself

 i love you

louis xvi was executed because they said he was dishonorable and a
criminal came into pierres head and from their point of view they
were right as were those too who canonized him and died a martyrs
death for his sake then robespierre was beheaded for being a despot
who is right and who is wrong no one but if you are alivelive
tomorrow youll die as i might have died an hour ago and is it worth
tormenting oneself when one has only a moment of life in comparison
with eternity

but at the moment when he imagined himself calmed by such reflections
she suddenly came into his mind as she was at the moments when he had
most strongly expressed his insincere love for her and he felt the
blood rush to his heart and had again to get up and move about and break
and tear whatever came to his hand why did i tell her that je vous
aime he kept repeating to himself and when he had said it for the
tenth time molieres words mais que diable allaitil faire dans cette
galere occurred to him and he began to laugh at himself

 but what the devil was he doing in that galley

in the night he called his valet and told him to pack up to go to
petersburg he could not imagine how he could speak to her now he
resolved to go away next day and leave a letter informing her of his
intention to part from her forever

next morning when the valet came into the room with his coffee pierre
was lying asleep on the ottoman with an open book in his hand

he woke up and looked round for a while with a startled expression
unable to realize where he was

the countess told me to inquire whether your excellency was at home
said the valet

but before pierre could decide what answer he would send the countess
herself in a white satin dressing gown embroidered with silver and with
simply dressed hair two immense plaits twice round her lovely head like
a coronet entered the room calm and majestic except that there was a
wrathful wrinkle on her rather prominent marble brow with her
imperturbable calm she did not begin to speak in front of the valet she
knew of the duel and had come to speak about it she waited till the
valet had set down the coffee things and left the room pierre looked at
her timidly over his spectacles and like a hare surrounded by hounds
who lays back her ears and continues to crouch motionless before her
enemies he tried to continue reading but feeling this to be senseless
and impossible he again glanced timidly at her she did not sit down
but looked at him with a contemptuous smile waiting for the valet to
go

well whats this now what have you been up to now i should like to
know she asked sternly

i what have i stammered pierre

so it seems youre a hero eh come now what was this duel about what
is it meant to prove what i ask you

pierre turned over heavily on the ottoman and opened his mouth but
could not reply

if you wont answer ill tell you hélène went on you believe
everything youre told you were told hélène laughed that dólokhov
was my lover she said in french with her coarse plainness of speech
uttering the word amant as casually as any other word and you believed
it well what have you proved what does this duel prove that youre a
fool que vous etes un sot but everybody knew that what will be the
result that i shall be the laughingstock of all moscow that everyone
will say that you drunk and not knowing what you were about challenged
a man you are jealous of without cause hélène raised her voice and
became more and more excited a man whos a better man than you in
every way

hm hm growled pierre frowning without looking at her and not
moving a muscle

and how could you believe he was my lover why because i like his
company if you were cleverer and more agreeable i should prefer
yours

dont speak to me i beg you muttered pierre hoarsely

why shouldnt i speak i can speak as i like and i tell you plainly
that there are not many wives with husbands such as you who would not
have taken lovers des amants but i have not done so said she

pierre wished to say something looked at her with eyes whose strange
expression she did not understand and lay down again he was suffering
physically at that moment there was a weight on his chest and he could
not breathe he knew that he must do something to put an end to this
suffering but what he wanted to do was too terrible

we had better separate he muttered in a broken voice

separate very well but only if you give me a fortune said hélène
separate thats a thing to frighten me with

pierre leaped up from the sofa and rushed staggering toward her

ill kill you he shouted and seizing the marble top of a table with
a strength he had never before felt he made a step toward her
brandishing the slab

hélènes face became terrible she shrieked and sprang aside his
fathers nature showed itself in pierre he felt the fascination and
delight of frenzy he flung down the slab broke it and swooping down
on her with outstretched hands shouted get out in such a terrible
voice that the whole house heard it with horror god knows what he would
have done at that moment had hélène not fled from the room

a week later pierre gave his wife full power to control all his estates
in great russia which formed the larger part of his property and left
for petersburg alone





chapter vii

two months had elapsed since the news of the battle of austerlitz and
the loss of prince andrew had reached bald hills and in spite of the
letters sent through the embassy and all the searches made his body had
not been found nor was he on the list of prisoners what was worst of
all for his relations was the fact that there was still a possibility of
his having been picked up on the battlefield by the people of the place
and that he might now be lying recovering or dying alone among
strangers and unable to send news of himself the gazettes from which
the old prince first heard of the defeat at austerlitz stated as usual
very briefly and vaguely that after brilliant engagements the russians
had had to retreat and had made their withdrawal in perfect order the
old prince understood from this official report that our army had been
defeated a week after the gazette report of the battle of austerlitz
came a letter from kutúzov informing the prince of the fate that had
befallen his son

your son wrote kutúzov fell before my eyes a standard in his hand
and at the head of a regimenthe fell as a hero worthy of his father
and his fatherland to the great regret of myself and of the whole army
it is still uncertain whether he is alive or not i comfort myself and
you with the hope that your son is alive for otherwise he would have
been mentioned among the officers found on the field of battle a list
of whom has been sent me under flag of truce

after receiving this news late in the evening when he was alone in his
study the old prince went for his walk as usual next morning but he
was silent with his steward the gardener and the architect and though
he looked very grim he said nothing to anyone

when princess mary went to him at the usual hour he was working at his
lathe and as usual did not look round at her

ah princess mary he said suddenly in an unnatural voice throwing
down his chisel the wheel continued to revolve by its own impetus and
princess mary long remembered the dying creak of that wheel which
merged in her memory with what followed

she approached him saw his face and something gave way within her her
eyes grew dim by the expression of her fathers face not sad not
crushed but angry and working unnaturally she saw that hanging over
her and about to crush her was some terrible misfortune the worst in
life one she had not yet experienced irreparable and
incomprehensiblethe death of one she loved

father andrewsaid the ungraceful awkward princess with such an
indescribable charm of sorrow and selfforgetfulness that her father
could not bear her look but turned away with a sob

bad news hes not among the prisoners nor among the killed kutúzov
writes and he screamed as piercingly as if he wished to drive the
princess away by that scream killed

the princess did not fall down or faint she was already pale but on
hearing these words her face changed and something brightened in her
beautiful radiant eyes it was as if joya supreme joy apart from the
joys and sorrows of this worldoverflowed the great grief within her
she forgot all fear of her father went up to him took his hand and
drawing him down put her arm round his thin scraggy neck

father she said do not turn away from me let us weep together

scoundrels blackguards shrieked the old man turning his face away
from her destroying the army destroying the men and why go go and
tell lise

the princess sank helplessly into an armchair beside her father and
wept she saw her brother now as he had been at the moment when he took
leave of her and of lise his look tender yet proud she saw him tender
and amused as he was when he put on the little icon did he believe
had he repented of his unbelief was he now there there in the realms
of eternal peace and blessedness she thought

father tell me how it happened she asked through her tears

go go killed in battle where the best of russian men and russias
glory were led to destruction go princess mary go and tell lise i
will follow

when princess mary returned from her father the little princess sat
working and looked up with that curious expression of inner happy calm
peculiar to pregnant women it was evident that her eyes did not see
princess mary but were looking within into herself at something
joyful and mysterious taking place within her

mary she said moving away from the embroidery frame and lying back
give me your hand she took her sisterinlaws hand and held it below
her waist

her eyes were smiling expectantly her downy lip rose and remained
lifted in childlike happiness

princess mary knelt down before her and hid her face in the folds of her
sisterinlaws dress

there there do you feel it i feel so strange and do you know mary
i am going to love him very much said lise looking with bright and
happy eyes at her sisterinlaw

princess mary could not lift her head she was weeping

what is the matter mary

nothing only i feel sad sad about andrew she said wiping away
her tears on her sisterinlaws knee

several times in the course of the morning princess mary began trying to
prepare her sisterinlaw and every time began to cry unobservant as
was the little princess these tears the cause of which she did not
understand agitated her she said nothing but looked about uneasily as
if in search of something before dinner the old prince of whom she was
always afraid came into her room with a peculiarly restless and malign
expression and went out again without saying a word she looked at
princess mary then sat thinking for a while with that expression of
attention to something within her that is only seen in pregnant women
and suddenly began to cry

has anything come from andrew she asked

no you know its too soon for news but my father is anxious and i
feel afraid

so theres nothing

nothing answered princess mary looking firmly with her radiant eyes
at her sisterinlaw

she had determined not to tell her and persuaded her father to hide the
terrible news from her till after her confinement which was expected
within a few days princess mary and the old prince each bore and hid
their grief in their own way the old prince would not cherish any hope
he made up his mind that prince andrew had been killed and though he
sent an official to austria to seek for traces of his son he ordered a
monument from moscow which he intended to erect in his own garden to his
memory and he told everybody that his son had been killed he tried not
to change his former way of life but his strength failed him he walked
less ate less slept less and became weaker every day princess mary
hoped she prayed for her brother as living and was always awaiting news
of his return





chapter viii

dearest said the little princess after breakfast on the morning of
the nineteenth march and her downy little lip rose from old habit but
as sorrow was manifest in every smile the sound of every word and even
every footstep in that house since the terrible news had come so now
the smile of the little princessinfluenced by the general mood though
without knowing its causewas such as to remind one still more of the
general sorrow

dearest im afraid this mornings fruschtique as foka the cook calls
ithas disagreed with me

 fruhstuck breakfast

what is the matter with you my darling you look pale oh you are
very pale said princess mary in alarm running with her soft
ponderous steps up to her sisterinlaw

your excellency should not mary bogdanovna be sent for said one of
the maids who was present mary bogdanovna was a midwife from the
neighboring town who had been at bald hills for the last fortnight

oh yes assented princess mary perhaps thats it ill go courage
my angel she kissed lise and was about to leave the room

oh no no and besides the pallor and the physical suffering on the
little princess face an expression of childish fear of inevitable pain
showed itself

no its only indigestion say its only indigestion say so mary
say and the little princess began to cry capriciously like a
suffering child and to wring her little hands even with some
affectation princess mary ran out of the room to fetch mary bogdanovna

mon dieu mon dieu oh she heard as she left the room

the midwife was already on her way to meet her rubbing her small plump
white hands with an air of calm importance

mary bogdanovna i think its beginning said princess mary looking at
the midwife with wideopen eyes of alarm

well the lord be thanked princess said mary bogdanovna not
hastening her steps you young ladies should not know anything about
it

but how is it the doctor from moscow is not here yet said the
princess in accordance with lises and prince andrews wishes they had
sent in good time to moscow for a doctor and were expecting him at any
moment

no matter princess dont be alarmed said mary bogdanovna well
manage very well without a doctor

five minutes later princess mary from her room heard something heavy
being carried by she looked out the men servants were carrying the
large leather sofa from prince andrews study into the bedroom on their
faces was a quiet and solemn look

princess mary sat alone in her room listening to the sounds in the
house now and then opening her door when someone passed and watching
what was going on in the passage some women passing with quiet steps in
and out of the bedroom glanced at the princess and turned away she did
not venture to ask any questions and shut the door again now sitting
down in her easy chair now taking her prayer book now kneeling before
the icon stand to her surprise and distress she found that her prayers
did not calm her excitement suddenly her door opened softly and her old
nurse praskovya savishna who hardly ever came to that room as the old
prince had forbidden it appeared on the threshold with a shawl round
her head

ive come to sit with you a bit másha said the nurse and here ive
brought the princes wedding candles to light before his saint my
angel she said with a sigh

oh nurse im so glad

god is merciful birdie

the nurse lit the gilt candles before the icons and sat down by the door
with her knitting princess mary took a book and began reading only
when footsteps or voices were heard did they look at one another the
princess anxious and inquiring the nurse encouraging everyone in the
house was dominated by the same feeling that princess mary experienced
as she sat in her room but owing to the superstition that the fewer the
people who know of it the less a woman in travail suffers everyone
tried to pretend not to know no one spoke of it but apart from the
ordinary staid and respectful good manners habitual in the princes
household a common anxiety a softening of the heart and a
consciousness that something great and mysterious was being accomplished
at that moment made itself felt

there was no laughter in the maids large hall in the men servants
hall all sat waiting silently and alert in the outlying serfs
quarters torches and candles were burning and no one slept the old
prince stepping on his heels paced up and down his study and sent
tíkhon to ask mary bogdanovna what newssay only that the prince told
me to ask and come and tell me her answer

inform the prince that labor has begun said mary bogdanovna giving
the messenger a significant look

tíkhon went and told the prince

very good said the prince closing the door behind him and tíkhon did
not hear the slightest sound from the study after that

after a while he reentered it as if to snuff the candles and seeing
the prince was lying on the sofa looked at him noticed his perturbed
face shook his head and going up to him silently kissed him on the
shoulder and left the room without snuffing the candles or saying why he
had entered the most solemn mystery in the world continued its course
evening passed night came and the feeling of suspense and softening of
heart in the presence of the unfathomable did not lessen but increased
no one slept

it was one of those march nights when winter seems to wish to resume its
sway and scatters its last snows and storms with desperate fury a relay
of horses had been sent up the highroad to meet the german doctor from
moscow who was expected every moment and men on horseback with lanterns
were sent to the crossroads to guide him over the country road with its
hollows and snowcovered pools of water

princess mary had long since put aside her book she sat silent her
luminous eyes fixed on her nurses wrinkled face every line of which
she knew so well on the lock of gray hair that escaped from under the
kerchief and the loose skin that hung under her chin

nurse savishna knitting in hand was telling in low tones scarcely
hearing or understanding her own words what she had told hundreds of
times before how the late princess had given birth to princess mary in
kishenev with only a moldavian peasant woman to help instead of a
midwife

god is merciful doctors are never needed she said

suddenly a gust of wind beat violently against the casement of the
window from which the double frame had been removed by order of the
prince one window frame was removed in each room as soon as the larks
returned and forcing open a loosely closed latch set the damask
curtain flapping and blew out the candle with its chill snowy draft
princess mary shuddered her nurse putting down the stocking she was
knitting went to the window and leaning out tried to catch the open
casement the cold wind flapped the ends of her kerchief and her loose
locks of gray hair

princess my dear theres someone driving up the avenue she said
holding the casement and not closing it with lanterns most likely the
doctor

oh my god thank god said princess mary i must go and meet him he
does not know russian

princess mary threw a shawl over her head and ran to meet the newcomer
as she was crossing the anteroom she saw through the window a carriage
with lanterns standing at the entrance she went out on the stairs on
a banister post stood a tallow candle which guttered in the draft on
the landing below philip the footman stood looking scared and holding
another candle still lower beyond the turn of the staircase one could
hear the footstep of someone in thick felt boots and a voice that
seemed familiar to princess mary was saying something

thank god said the voice and father

gone to bed replied the voice of demyan the house steward who was
downstairs

then the voice said something more demyan replied and the steps in the
felt boots approached the unseen bend of the staircase more rapidly

its andrew thought princess mary no it cant be that would be too
extraordinary and at the very moment she thought this the face and
figure of prince andrew in a fur cloak the deep collar of which covered
with snow appeared on the landing where the footman stood with the
candle yes it was he pale thin with a changed and strangely
softened but agitated expression on his face he came up the stairs and
embraced his sister

you did not get my letter he asked and not waiting for a replywhich
he would not have received for the princess was unable to speakhe
turned back rapidly mounted the stairs again with the doctor who had
entered the hall after him they had met at the last post station and
again embraced his sister

what a strange fate másha darling and having taken off his cloak and
felt boots he went to the little princess apartment





chapter ix

the little princess lay supported by pillows with a white cap on her
head the pains had just left her strands of her black hair lay round
her inflamed and perspiring cheeks her charming rosy mouth with its
downy lip was open and she was smiling joyfully prince andrew entered
and paused facing her at the foot of the sofa on which she was lying
her glittering eyes filled with childlike fear and excitement rested
on him without changing their expression i love you all and have done
no harm to anyone why must i suffer so help me her look seemed to
say she saw her husband but did not realize the significance of his
appearance before her now prince andrew went round the sofa and kissed
her forehead

my darling he saida word he had never used to her before god is
merciful

she looked at him inquiringly and with childlike reproach

i expected help from you and i get none none from you either said
her eyes she was not surprised at his having come she did not realize
that he had come his coming had nothing to do with her sufferings or
with their relief the pangs began again and mary bogdanovna advised
prince andrew to leave the room

the doctor entered prince andrew went out and meeting princess mary
again joined her they began talking in whispers but their talk broke
off at every moment they waited and listened

go dear said princess mary

prince andrew went again to his wife and sat waiting in the room next to
hers a woman came from the bedroom with a frightened face and became
confused when she saw prince andrew he covered his face with his hands
and remained so for some minutes piteous helpless animal moans came
through the door prince andrew got up went to the door and tried to
open it someone was holding it shut

you cant come in you cant said a terrified voice from within

he began pacing the room the screaming ceased and a few more seconds
went by then suddenly a terrible shriekit could not be hers she could
not scream like thatcame from the bedroom prince andrew ran to the
door the scream ceased and he heard the wail of an infant

what have they taken a baby in there for thought prince andrew in the
first second a baby what baby why is there a baby there or is
the baby born

then suddenly he realized the joyful significance of that wail tears
choked him and leaning his elbows on the window sill be began to cry
sobbing like a child the door opened the doctor with his shirt sleeves
tucked up without a coat pale and with a trembling jaw came out of
the room prince andrew turned to him but the doctor gave him a
bewildered look and passed by without a word a woman rushed out and
seeing prince andrew stopped hesitating on the threshold he went into
his wifes room she was lying dead in the same position he had seen
her in five minutes before and despite the fixed eyes and the pallor of
the cheeks the same expression was on her charming childlike face with
its upper lip covered with tiny black hair

i love you all and have done no harm to anyone and what have you done
to mesaid her charming pathetic dead face

in a corner of the room something red and tiny gave a grunt and squealed
in mary bogdanovnas trembling white hands

two hours later prince andrew stepping softly went into his fathers
room the old man already knew everything he was standing close to the
door and as soon as it opened his rough old arms closed like a vise
round his sons neck and without a word he began to sob like a child

three days later the little princess was buried and prince andrew went
up the steps to where the coffin stood to give her the farewell kiss
and there in the coffin was the same face though with closed eyes ah
what have you done to me it still seemed to say and prince andrew
felt that something gave way in his soul and that he was guilty of a sin
he could neither remedy nor forget he could not weep the old man too
came up and kissed the waxen little hands that lay quietly crossed one
on the other on her breast and to him too her face seemed to say
ah what have you done to me and why and at the sight the old man
turned angrily away

another five days passed and then the young prince nicholas andréevich
was baptized the wet nurse supported the coverlet with her chin while
the priest with a goose feather anointed the boys little red and
wrinkled soles and palms

his grandfather who was his godfather trembling and afraid of dropping
him carried the infant round the battered tin font and handed him over
to the godmother princess mary prince andrew sat in another room
faint with fear lest the baby should be drowned in the font and awaited
the termination of the ceremony he looked up joyfully at the baby when
the nurse brought it to him and nodded approval when she told him that
the wax with the babys hair had not sunk in the font but had floated





chapter x

rostóvs share in dólokhovs duel with bezúkhov was hushed up by the
efforts of the old count and instead of being degraded to the ranks as
he expected he was appointed an adjutant to the governor general of
moscow as a result he could not go to the country with the rest of the
family but was kept all summer in moscow by his new duties dólokhov
recovered and rostóv became very friendly with him during his
convalescence dólokhov lay ill at his mothers who loved him
passionately and tenderly and old mary ivánovna who had grown fond of
rostóv for his friendship to her fedya often talked to him about her
son

yes count she would say he is too noble and puresouled for our
present depraved world no one now loves virtue it seems like a
reproach to everyone now tell me count was it right was it
honorable of bezúkhov and fedya with his noble spirit loved him and
even now never says a word against him those pranks in petersburg when
they played some tricks on a policeman didnt they do it together and
there bezúkhov got off scotfree while fedya had to bear the whole
burden on his shoulders fancy what he had to go through its true he
has been reinstated but how could they fail to do that i think there
were not many such gallant sons of the fatherland out there as he and
nowthis duel have these people no feeling or honor knowing him to be
an only son to challenge him and shoot so straight its well god had
mercy on us and what was it for who doesnt have intrigues nowadays
why if he was so jealous as i see things he should have shown it
sooner but he lets it go on for months and then to call him out
reckoning on fedya not fighting because he owed him money what
baseness what meanness i know you understand fedya my dear count
that believe me is why i am so fond of you few people do understand
him he is such a lofty heavenly soul

dólokhov himself during his convalescence spoke to rostóv in a way no
one would have expected of him

i know people consider me a bad man he said let them i dont care
a straw about anyone but those i love but those i love i love so that
i would give my life for them and the others id throttle if they stood
in my way i have an adored a priceless mother and two or three
friendsyou among themand as for the rest i only care about them in so
far as they are harmful or useful and most of them are harmful
especially the women yes dear boy he continued i have met loving
noble highminded men but i have not yet met any womencountesses or
cookswho were not venal i have not yet met that divine purity and
devotion i look for in women if i found such a one id give my life for
her but those and he made a gesture of contempt and believe me
if i still value my life it is only because i still hope to meet such a
divine creature who will regenerate purify and elevate me but you
dont understand it

oh yes i quite understand answered rostóv who was under his new
friends influence

in the autumn the rostóvs returned to moscow early in the winter
denisov also came back and stayed with them the first half of the
winter of  which nicholas rostóv spent in moscow was one of the
happiest merriest times for him and the whole family nicholas brought
many young men to his parents house véra was a handsome girl of
twenty sónya a girl of sixteen with all the charm of an opening flower
natásha half grown up and half child was now childishly amusing now
girlishly enchanting

at that time in the rostóvs house there prevailed an amorous atmosphere
characteristic of homes where there are very young and very charming
girls every young man who came to the houseseeing those
impressionable smiling young faces smiling probably at their own
happiness feeling the eager bustle around him and hearing the fitful
bursts of song and music and the inconsequent but friendly prattle of
young girls ready for anything and full of hopeexperienced the same
feeling sharing with the young folk of the rostóvs household a
readiness to fall in love and an expectation of happiness

among the young men introduced by rostóv one of the first was dólokhov
whom everyone in the house liked except natásha she almost quarreled
with her brother about him she insisted that he was a bad man and that
in the duel with bezúkhov pierre was right and dólokhov wrong and
further that he was disagreeable and unnatural

theres nothing for me to understand she cried out with resolute
selfwill he is wicked and heartless there now i like your denisov
though he is a rake and all that still i like him so you see i do
understand i dont know how to put it with this one everything is
calculated and i dont like that but denisov

oh denisov is quite different replied nicholas implying that even
denisov was nothing compared to dólokhovyou must understand what a
soul there is in dólokhov you should see him with his mother what a
heart

well i dont know about that but i am uncomfortable with him and do
you know he has fallen in love with sónya

what nonsense

im certain of it youll see

natáshas prediction proved true dólokhov who did not usually care for
the society of ladies began to come often to the house and the
question for whose sake he came though no one spoke of it was soon
settled he came because of sónya and sónya though she would never
have dared to say so knew it and blushed scarlet every time dólokhov
appeared

dólokhov often dined at the rostóvs never missed a performance at
which they were present and went to iogels balls for young people
which the rostóvs always attended he was pointedly attentive to sónya
and looked at her in such a way that not only could she not bear his
glances without coloring but even the old countess and natásha blushed
when they saw his looks

it was evident that this strange strong man was under the irresistible
influence of the dark graceful girl who loved another

rostóv noticed something new in dólokhovs relations with sónya but he
did not explain to himself what these new relations were theyre
always in love with someone he thought of sónya and natásha but he
was not as much at ease with sónya and dólokhov as before and was less
frequently at home

in the autumn of  everybody had again begun talking of the war with
napoleon with even greater warmth than the year before orders were
given to raise recruits ten men in every thousand for the regular army
and besides this nine men in every thousand for the militia everywhere
bonaparte was anathematized and in moscow nothing but the coming war was
talked of for the rostóv family the whole interest of these
preparations for war lay in the fact that nicholas would not hear of
remaining in moscow and only awaited the termination of denisovs
furlough after christmas to return with him to their regiment his
approaching departure did not prevent his amusing himself but rather
gave zest to his pleasures he spent the greater part of his time away
from home at dinners parties and balls





chapter xi

on the third day after christmas nicholas dined at home a thing he had
rarely done of late it was a grand farewell dinner as he and denisov
were leaving to join their regiment after epiphany about twenty people
were present including dólokhov and denisov

never had love been so much in the air and never had the amorous
atmosphere made itself so strongly felt in the rostóvs house as at this
holiday time seize the moments of happiness love and be loved that
is the only reality in the world all else is folly it is the one thing
we are interested in here said the spirit of the place

nicholas having as usual exhausted two pairs of horses without
visiting all the places he meant to go to and where he had been invited
returned home just before dinner as soon as he entered he noticed and
felt the tension of the amorous air in the house and also noticed a
curious embarrassment among some of those present sónya dólokhov and
the old countess were especially disturbed and to a lesser degree
natásha nicholas understood that something must have happened between
sónya and dólokhov before dinner and with the kindly sensitiveness
natural to him was very gentle and wary with them both at dinner on
that same evening there was to be one of the balls that iogel the
dancing master gave for his pupils during the holidays

nicholas will you come to iogels please do said natásha he asked
you and vasíli dmítrich  is also going

 denisov

where would i not go at the countess command said denisov who at
the rostóvs had jocularly assumed the role of natáshas knight im
even weady to dance the pas de chale

if i have time answered nicholas but i promised the arkhárovs they
have a party

and you he asked dólokhov but as soon as he had asked the question
he noticed that it should not have been put

perhaps coldly and angrily replied dólokhov glancing at sónya and
scowling he gave nicholas just such a look as he had given pierre at
the club dinner

there is something up thought nicholas and he was further confirmed
in this conclusion by the fact that dólokhov left immediately after
dinner he called natásha and asked her what was the matter

and i was looking for you said natásha running out to him i told
you but you would not believe it she said triumphantly he has
proposed to sónya

little as nicholas had occupied himself with sónya of late something
seemed to give way within him at this news dólokhov was a suitable and
in some respects a brilliant match for the dowerless orphan girl from
the point of view of the old countess and of society it was out of the
question for her to refuse him and therefore nicholas first feeling on
hearing the news was one of anger with sónya he tried to say
thats capital of course shell forget her childish promises and
accept the offer but before he had time to say it natásha began again

and fancy she refused him quite definitely adding after a pause
she told him she loved another

yes my sónya could not have done otherwise thought nicholas

much as mamma pressed her she refused and i know she wont change
once she has said

and mamma pressed her said nicholas reproachfully

yes said natásha do you know nicholasdont be angrybut i know
you will not marry her i know heaven knows how but i know for certain
that you wont marry her

now you dont know that at all said nicholas but i must talk to
her what a darling sónya is he added with a smile

ah she is indeed a darling ill send her to you

and natásha kissed her brother and ran away

a minute later sónya came in with a frightened guilty and scared look
nicholas went up to her and kissed her hand this was the first time
since his return that they had talked alone and about their love

sophie he began timidly at first and then more and more boldly if
you wish to refuse one who is not only a brilliant and advantageous
match but a splendid noble fellow he is my friend

sónya interrupted him

i have already refused she said hurriedly

if you are refusing for my sake i am afraid that i

sónya again interrupted she gave him an imploring frightened look

nicholas dont tell me that she said

no but i must it may be arrogant of me but still it is best to say
it if you refuse him on my account i must tell you the whole truth i
love you and i think i love you more than anyone else

that is enough for me said sónya blushing

no but i have been in love a thousand times and shall fall in love
again though for no one have i such a feeling of friendship
confidence and love as i have for you then i am young mamma does not
wish it in a word i make no promise and i beg you to consider
dólokhovs offer he said articulating his friends name with
difficulty

dont say that to me i want nothing i love you as a brother and
always shall and i want nothing more

you are an angel i am not worthy of you but i am afraid of misleading
you

and nicholas again kissed her hand





chapter xii

iogels were the most enjoyable balls in moscow so said the mothers as
they watched their young people executing their newly learned steps and
so said the youths and maidens themselves as they danced till they were
ready to drop and so said the grownup young men and women who came to
these balls with an air of condescension and found them most enjoyable
that year two marriages had come of these balls the two pretty young
princesses gorchakov met suitors there and were married and so further
increased the fame of these dances what distinguished them from others
was the absence of host or hostess and the presence of the goodnatured
iogel flying about like a feather and bowing according to the rules of
his art as he collected the tickets from all his visitors there was
the fact that only those came who wished to dance and amuse themselves
as girls of thirteen and fourteen do who are wearing long dresses for
the first time with scarcely any exceptions they all were or seemed to
be prettyso rapturous were their smiles and so sparkling their eyes
sometimes the best of the pupils of whom natásha who was exceptionally
graceful was first even danced the pas de chale but at this last ball
only the ecossaise the anglaise and the mazurka which was just coming
into fashion were danced iogel had taken a ballroom in bezúkhovs
house and the ball as everyone said was a great success there were
many pretty girls and the rostóv girls were among the prettiest they
were both particularly happy and gay that evening proud of dólokhovs
proposal her refusal and her explanation with nicholas sónya twirled
about before she left home so that the maid could hardly get her hair
plaited and she was transparently radiant with impulsive joy

natásha no less proud of her first long dress and of being at a real
ball was even happier they were both dressed in white muslin with pink
ribbons

natásha fell in love the very moment she entered the ballroom she was
not in love with anyone in particular but with everyone whatever
person she happened to look at she was in love with for that moment

oh how delightful it is she kept saying running up to sónya

nicholas and denisov were walking up and down looking with kindly
patronage at the dancers

how sweet she isshe will be a weal beauty said denisov

who

countess natásha answered denisov

and how she dances what gwace he said again after a pause

who are you talking about

about your sister ejaculated denisov testily

rostóv smiled

my dear count you were one of my best pupilsyou must dance said
little iogel coming up to nicholas look how many charming young
ladies he turned with the same request to denisov who was also a
former pupil of his

no my dear fellow ill be a wallflower said denisov dont you
wecollect what bad use i made of your lessons

oh no said iogel hastening to reassure him you were only
inattentive but you had talentoh yes you had talent

the band struck up the newly introduced mazurka nicholas could not
refuse iogel and asked sónya to dance denisov sat down by the old
ladies and leaning on his saber and beating time with his foot told
them something funny and kept them amused while he watched the young
people dancing iogel with natásha his pride and his best pupil were
the first couple noiselessly skillfully stepping with his little feet
in low shoes iogel flew first across the hall with natásha who though
shy went on carefully executing her steps denisov did not take his
eyes off her and beat time with his saber in a way that clearly
indicated that if he was not dancing it was because he would not and not
because he could not in the middle of a figure he beckoned to rostóv
who was passing

this is not at all the thing he said what sort of polish mazuwka is
this but she does dance splendidly

knowing that denisov had a reputation even in poland for the masterly
way in which he danced the mazurka nicholas ran up to natásha

go and choose denisov he is a real dancer a wonder he said

when it came to natáshas turn to choose a partner she rose and
tripping rapidly across in her little shoes trimmed with bows ran
timidly to the corner where denisov sat she saw that everybody was
looking at her and waiting nicholas saw that denisov was refusing
though he smiled delightedly he ran up to them

please vasíli dmítrich natásha was saying do come

oh no let me off countess denisov replied

now then vaska said nicholas

they coax me as if i were vaska the cat said denisov jokingly

ill sing for you a whole evening said natásha

oh the faiwy she can do anything with me said denisov and he
unhooked his saber he came out from behind the chairs clasped his
partners hand firmly threw back his head and advanced his foot
waiting for the beat only on horse back and in the mazurka was
denisovs short stature not noticeable and he looked the fine fellow he
felt himself to be at the right beat of the music he looked sideways at
his partner with a merry and triumphant air suddenly stamped with one
foot bounded from the floor like a ball and flew round the room taking
his partner with him he glided silently on one foot half across the
room and seeming not to notice the chairs was dashing straight at them
when suddenly clinking his spurs and spreading out his legs he stopped
short on his heels stood so a second stamped on the spot clanking his
spurs whirled rapidly round and striking his left heel against his
right flew round again in a circle natásha guessed what he meant to
do and abandoning herself to him followed his lead hardly knowing how
first he spun her round holding her now with his left now with his
right hand then falling on one knee he twirled her round him and again
jumping up dashed so impetuously forward that it seemed as if he would
rush through the whole suite of rooms without drawing breath and then
he suddenly stopped and performed some new and unexpected steps when at
last smartly whirling his partner round in front of her chair he drew
up with a click of his spurs and bowed to her natásha did not even make
him a curtsy she fixed her eyes on him in amazement smiling as if she
did not recognize him

what does this mean she brought out

although iogel did not acknowledge this to be the real mazurka everyone
was delighted with denisovs skill he was asked again and again as a
partner and the old men began smilingly to talk about poland and the
good old days denisov flushed after the mazurka and mopping himself
with his handkerchief sat down by natásha and did not leave her for the
rest of the evening





chapter xiii

for two days after that rostóv did not see dólokhov at his own or at
dólokhovs home on the third day he received a note from him

as i do not intend to be at your house again for reasons you know of
and am going to rejoin my regiment i am giving a farewell supper
tonight to my friendscome to the english hotel

about ten oclock rostóv went to the english hotel straight from the
theater where he had been with his family and denisov he was at once
shown to the best room which dólokhov had taken for that evening some
twenty men were gathered round a table at which dólokhov sat between two
candles on the table was a pile of gold and paper money and he was
keeping the bank rostóv had not seen him since his proposal and sónyas
refusal and felt uncomfortable at the thought of how they would meet

dólokhovs clear cold glance met rostóv as soon as he entered the door
as though he had long expected him

its a long time since we met he said thanks for coming ill just
finish dealing and then ilyushka will come with his chorus

i called once or twice at your house said rostóv reddening

dólokhov made no reply

you may punt he said

rostóv recalled at that moment a strange conversation he had once had
with dólokhov none but fools trust to luck in play dólokhov had then
said

or are you afraid to play with me dólokhov now asked as if guessing
rostóvs thought

beneath his smile rostóv saw in him the mood he had shown at the club
dinner and at other times when as if tired of everyday life he had felt
a need to escape from it by some strange and usually cruel action

rostóv felt ill at ease he tried but failed to find some joke with
which to reply to dólokhovs words but before he had thought of
anything dólokhov looking straight in his face said slowly and
deliberately so that everyone could hear

do you remember we had a talk about cards hes a fool who trusts to
luck one should make certain and i want to try

to try his luck or the certainty rostóv asked himself

well youd better not play dólokhov added and springing a new pack
of cards said bank gentlemen

moving the money forward he prepared to deal rostóv sat down by his
side and at first did not play dólokhov kept glancing at him

why dont you play he asked

and strange to say nicholas felt that he could not help taking up a
card putting a small stake on it and beginning to play

i have no money with me he said

ill trust you

rostóv staked five rubles on a card and lost staked again and again
lost dólokhov killed that is beat ten cards of rostóvs running

gentlemen said dólokhov after he had dealt for some time please
place your money on the cards or i may get muddled in the reckoning

one of the players said he hoped he might be trusted

yes you might but i am afraid of getting the accounts mixed so i ask
you to put the money on your cards replied dólokhov dont stint
yourself well settle afterwards he added turning to rostóv

the game continued a waiter kept handing round champagne

all rostóvs cards were beaten and he had eight hundred rubles scored up
against him he wrote  rubles on a card but while the waiter
filled his glass he changed his mind and altered it to his usual stake
of twenty rubles

leave it said dólokhov though he did not seem to be even looking at
rostóv youll win it back all the sooner i lose to the others but win
from you or are you afraid of me he asked again

rostóv submitted he let the eight hundred remain and laid down a seven
of hearts with a torn corner which he had picked up from the floor he
well remembered that seven afterwards he laid down the seven of hearts
on which with a broken bit of chalk he had written  rubles in clear
upright figures he emptied the glass of warm champagne that was handed
him smiled at dólokhovs words and with a sinking heart waiting for a
seven to turn up gazed at dólokhovs hands which held the pack much
depended on rostóvs winning or losing on that seven of hearts on the
previous sunday the old count had given his son two thousand rubles and
though he always disliked speaking of money difficulties had told
nicholas that this was all he could let him have till may and asked him
to be more economical this time nicholas had replied that it would be
more than enough for him and that he gave his word of honor not to take
anything more till the spring now only twelve hundred rubles was left
of that money so that this seven of hearts meant for him not only the
loss of sixteen hundred rubles but the necessity of going back on his
word with a sinking heart he watched dólokhovs hands and thought now
then make haste and let me have this card and ill take my cap and
drive home to supper with denisov natásha and sónya and will
certainly never touch a card again at that moment his home life jokes
with pétya talks with sónya duets with natásha piquet with his
father and even his comfortable bed in the house on the povarskáya rose
before him with such vividness clearness and charm that it seemed as
if it were all a lost and unappreciated bliss long past he could not
conceive that a stupid chance letting the seven be dealt to the right
rather than to the left might deprive him of all this happiness newly
appreciated and newly illumined and plunge him into the depths of
unknown and undefined misery that could not be yet he awaited with a
sinking heart the movement of dólokhovs hands those broad reddish
hands with hairy wrists visible from under the shirt cuffs laid down
the pack and took up a glass and a pipe that were handed him

so you are not afraid to play with me repeated dólokhov and as if
about to tell a good story he put down the cards leaned back in his
chair and began deliberately with a smile

yes gentlemen ive been told theres a rumor going about moscow that
im a sharper so i advise you to be careful

come now deal exclaimed rostóv

oh those moscow gossips said dólokhov and he took up the cards with
a smile

aah rostóv almost screamed lifting both hands to his head the seven
he needed was lying uppermost the first card in the pack he had lost
more than he could pay

still dont ruin yourself said dólokhov with a side glance at rostóv
as he continued to deal





chapter xiv

an hour and a half later most of the players were but little interested
in their own play

the whole interest was concentrated on rostóv instead of sixteen
hundred rubles he had a long column of figures scored against him which
he had reckoned up to ten thousand but that now as he vaguely
supposed must have risen to fifteen thousand in reality it already
exceeded twenty thousand rubles dólokhov was no longer listening to
stories or telling them but followed every movement of rostóvs hands
and occasionally ran his eyes over the score against him he had decided
to play until that score reached fortythree thousand he had fixed on
that number because fortythree was the sum of his and sónyas joint
ages rostóv leaning his head on both hands sat at the table which was
scrawled over with figures wet with spilled wine and littered with
cards one tormenting impression did not leave him that those broad
boned reddish hands with hairy wrists visible from under the shirt
sleeves those hands which he loved and hated held him in their power

six hundred rubles ace a corner a nine winning it backs
impossible oh how pleasant it was at home the knave double or
quits it cant be and why is he doing this to me rostóv
pondered sometimes he staked a large sum but dólokhov refused to
accept it and fixed the stake himself nicholas submitted to him and at
one moment prayed to god as he had done on the battlefield at the bridge
over the enns and then guessed that the card that came first to hand
from the crumpled heap under the table would save him now counted the
cords on his coat and took a card with that number and tried staking the
total of his losses on it then he looked round for aid from the other
players or peered at the now cold face of dólokhov and tried to read
what was passing in his mind

he knows of course what this loss means to me he cant want my ruin
wasnt he my friend wasnt i fond of him but its not his fault
whats he to do if he has such luck and its not my fault either
he thought to himself i have done nothing wrong have i killed anyone
or insulted or wished harm to anyone why such a terrible misfortune
and when did it begin such a little while ago i came to this table with
the thought of winning a hundred rubles to buy that casket for mammas
name day and then going home i was so happy so free so lighthearted
and i did not realize how happy i was when did that end and when did
this new terrible state of things begin what marked the change i sat
all the time in this same place at this table chose and placed cards
and watched those broadboned agile hands in the same way when did it
happen and what has happened i am well and strong and still the same
and in the same place no it cant be surely it will all end in
nothing

he was flushed and bathed in perspiration though the room was not hot
his face was terrible and piteous to see especially from its helpless
efforts to seem calm

the score against him reached the fateful sum of fortythree thousand
rostóv had just prepared a card by bending the corner of which he meant
to double the three thousand just put down to his score when dólokhov
slamming down the pack of cards put it aside and began rapidly adding
up the total of rostóvs debt breaking the chalk as he marked the
figures in his clear bold hand

supper its time for supper and here are the gypsies

some swarthy men and women were really entering from the cold outside
and saying something in their gypsy accents nicholas understood that it
was all over but he said in an indifferent tone

well wont you go on i had a splendid card all ready as if it were
the fun of the game which interested him most

its all up im lost thought he now a bullet through my
brainthats all thats left me and at the same time he said in a
cheerful voice

come now just this one more little card

all right said dólokhov having finished the addition all right
twentyone rubles he said pointing to the figure twentyone by which
the total exceeded the round sum of fortythree thousand and taking up
a pack he prepared to deal rostóv submissively unbent the corner of his
card and instead of the six thousand he had intended carefully wrote
twentyone

its all the same to me he said i only want to see whether you will
let me win this ten or beat it

dólokhov began to deal seriously oh how rostóv detested at that moment
those hands with their short reddish fingers and hairy wrists which
held him in their power the ten fell to him

you owe fortythree thousand count said dólokhov and stretching
himself he rose from the table one does get tired sitting so long he
added

yes im tired too said rostóv

dólokhov cut him short as if to remind him that it was not for him to
jest

when am i to receive the money count

rostóv flushing drew dólokhov into the next room

i cannot pay it all immediately will you take an iou he said

i say rostóv said dólokhov clearly smiling and looking nicholas
straight in the eyes you know the saying lucky in love unlucky at
cards your cousin is in love with you i know

oh its terrible to feel oneself so in this mans power thought
rostóv he knew what a shock he would inflict on his father and mother
by the news of this loss he knew what a relief it would be to escape it
all and felt that dólokhov knew that he could save him from all this
shame and sorrow but wanted now to play with him as a cat does with a
mouse

your cousin dólokhov started to say but nicholas interrupted him

my cousin has nothing to do with this and its not necessary to mention
her he exclaimed fiercely

then when am i to have it

tomorrow replied rostóv and left the room





chapter xv

to say tomorrow and keep up a dignified tone was not difficult but to
go home alone see his sisters brother mother and father confess and
ask for money he had no right to after giving his word of honor was
terrible

at home they had not yet gone to bed the young people after returning
from the theater had had supper and were grouped round the clavichord
as soon as nicholas entered he was enfolded in that poetic atmosphere
of love which pervaded the rostóv household that winter and now after
dólokhovs proposal and iogels ball seemed to have grown thicker round
sónya and natásha as the air does before a thunderstorm sónya and
natásha in the lightblue dresses they had worn at the theater looking
pretty and conscious of it were standing by the clavichord happy and
smiling véra was playing chess with shinshín in the drawing room the
old countess waiting for the return of her husband and son sat playing
patience with the old gentlewoman who lived in their house denisov
with sparkling eyes and ruffled hair sat at the clavichord striking
chords with his short fingers his legs thrown back and his eyes rolling
as he sang with his small husky but true voice some verses called
enchantress which he had composed and to which he was trying to fit
music

enchantress say to my forsaken lyre what magic power is this recalls
me still what spark has set my inmost soul on fire what is this bliss
that makes my fingers thrill

he was singing in passionate tones gazing with his sparkling black
agate eyes at the frightened and happy natásha

splendid excellent exclaimed natásha another verse she said
without noticing nicholas

everythings still the same with them thought nicholas glancing into
the drawing room where he saw véra and his mother with the old lady

ah and heres nicholas cried natásha running up to him

is papa at home he asked

i am so glad youve come said natásha without answering him we are
enjoying ourselves vasíli dmítrich is staying a day longer for my sake
did you know

no papa is not back yet said sónya

nicholas have you come come here dear called the old countess from
the drawing room

nicholas went to her kissed her hand and sitting down silently at her
table began to watch her hands arranging the cards from the dancing
room they still heard the laughter and merry voices trying to persuade
natásha to sing

all wight all wight shouted denisov its no good making excuses
now its your turn to sing the bacawollai entweat you

the countess glanced at her silent son

what is the matter she asked

oh nothing said he as if weary of being continually asked the same
question will papa be back soon

i expect so

everythings the same with them they know nothing about it where am i
to go thought nicholas and went again into the dancing room where the
clavichord stood

sónya was sitting at the clavichord playing the prelude to denisovs
favorite barcarolle natásha was preparing to sing denisov was looking
at her with enraptured eyes

nicholas began pacing up and down the room

why do they want to make her sing how can she sing theres nothing to
be happy about thought he

sónya struck the first chord of the prelude

my god im a ruined and dishonored man a bullet through my brain is
the only thing left menot singing his thoughts ran on go away but
where to its onelet them sing

he continued to pace the room looking gloomily at denisov and the girls
and avoiding their eyes

nikolenka what is the matter sónyas eyes fixed on him seemed to
ask she noticed at once that something had happened to him

nicholas turned away from her natásha too with her quick instinct had
instantly noticed her brothers condition but though she noticed it
she was herself in such high spirits at that moment so far from sorrow
sadness or selfreproach that she purposely deceived herself as young
people often do no i am too happy now to spoil my enjoyment by
sympathy with anyones sorrow she felt and she said to herself no
i must be mistaken he must be feeling happy just as i am

now sónya she said going to the very middle of the room where she
considered the resonance was best

having lifted her head and let her arms droop lifelessly as ballet
dancers do natásha rising energetically from her heels to her toes
stepped to the middle of the room and stood still

yes thats me she seemed to say answering the rapt gaze with which
denisov followed her

and what is she so pleased about thought nicholas looking at his
sister why isnt she dull and ashamed

natásha took the first note her throat swelled her chest rose her
eyes became serious at that moment she was oblivious of her
surroundings and from her smiling lips flowed sounds which anyone may
produce at the same intervals and hold for the same time but which
leave you cold a thousand times and the thousand and first time thrill
you and make you weep

natásha that winter had for the first time begun to sing seriously
mainly because denisov so delighted in her singing she no longer sang
as a child there was no longer in her singing that comical childish
painstaking effect that had been in it before but she did not yet sing
well as all the connoisseurs who heard her said it is not trained
but it is a beautiful voice that must be trained only they generally
said this some time after she had finished singing while that untrained
voice with its incorrect breathing and labored transitions was
sounding even the connoisseurs said nothing but only delighted in it
and wished to hear it again in her voice there was a virginal
freshness an unconsciousness of her own powers and an as yet untrained
velvety softness which so mingled with her lack of art in singing that
it seemed as if nothing in that voice could be altered without spoiling
it

what is this thought nicholas listening to her with widely opened
eyes what has happened to her how she is singing today and suddenly
the whole world centered for him on anticipation of the next note the
next phrase and everything in the world was divided into three beats
oh mio crudele affetto one two three one two three
one oh mio crudele affetto one two three one oh this
senseless life of ours thought nicholas all this misery and money
and dólokhov and anger and honorits all nonsense but this is
real now then natásha now then dearest now then darling how
will she take that si shes taken it thank god and without noticing
that he was singing to strengthen the si he sung a second a third
below the high note ah god how fine did i really take it how
fortunate he thought

oh how that chord vibrated and how moved was something that was finest
in rostóvs soul and this something was apart from everything else in
the world and above everything in the world what were losses and
dólokhov and words of honor all nonsense one might kill and rob
and yet be happy





chapter xvi

it was long since rostóv had felt such enjoyment from music as he did
that day but no sooner had natásha finished her barcarolle than reality
again presented itself he got up without saying a word and went
downstairs to his own room a quarter of an hour later the old count
came in from his club cheerful and contented nicholas hearing him
drive up went to meet him

wellhad a good time said the old count smiling gaily and proudly at
his son

nicholas tried to say yes but could not and he nearly burst into
sobs the count was lighting his pipe and did not notice his sons
condition

ah it cant be avoided thought nicholas for the first and last
time and suddenly in the most casual tone which made him feel ashamed
of himself he said as if merely asking his father to let him have the
carriage to drive to town

papa i have come on a matter of business i was nearly forgetting i
need some money

dear me said his father who was in a specially good humor i told
you it would not be enough how much

very much said nicholas flushing and with a stupid careless smile
for which he was long unable to forgive himself i have lost a little
i mean a good deal a great dealforty three thousand

what to whom nonsense cried the count suddenly reddening with
an apoplectic flush over neck and nape as old people do

i promised to pay tomorrow said nicholas

well said the old count spreading out his arms and sinking
helplessly on the sofa

it cant be helped it happens to everyone said the son with a bold
free and easy tone while in his soul he regarded himself as a
worthless scoundrel whose whole life could not atone for his crime he
longed to kiss his fathers hands and kneel to beg his forgiveness but
said in a careless and even rude voice that it happens to everyone

the old count cast down his eyes on hearing his sons words and began
bustlingly searching for something

yes yes he muttered it will be difficult i fear difficult to
raise happens to everybody yes who has not done it

and with a furtive glance at his sons face the count went out of the
room nicholas had been prepared for resistance but had not at all
expected this

papa papa he called after him sobbing forgive me and seizing
his fathers hand he pressed it to his lips and burst into tears

while father and son were having their explanation the mother and
daughter were having one not less important natásha came running to her
mother quite excited

mamma mamma he has made me

made what

made made me an offer mamma mamma she exclaimed

the countess did not believe her ears denisov had proposed to whom to
this chit of a girl natásha who not so long ago was playing with dolls
and who was still having lessons

dont natásha what nonsense she said hoping it was a joke

nonsense indeed i am telling you the fact said natásha indignantly
i come to ask you what to do and you call it nonsense

the countess shrugged her shoulders

if it is true that monsieur denisov has made you a proposal tell him
he is a fool thats all

no hes not a fool replied natásha indignantly and seriously

well then what do you want youre all in love nowadays well if you
are in love marry him said the countess with a laugh of annoyance
good luck to you

no mamma im not in love with him i suppose im not in love with
him

well then tell him so

mamma are you cross dont be cross dear is it my fault

no but what is it my dear do you want me to go and tell him said
the countess smiling

no i will do it myself only tell me what to say its all very well
for you said natásha with a responsive smile you should have seen
how he said it i know he did not mean to say it but it came out
accidently

well all the same you must refuse him

no i mustnt i am so sorry for him hes so nice

well then accept his offer its high time for you to be married
answered the countess sharply and sarcastically

no mamma but im so sorry for him i dont know how im to say it

and theres nothing for you to say i shall speak to him myself said
the countess indignant that they should have dared to treat this little
natásha as grown up

no not on any account i will tell him myself and youll listen at
the door and natásha ran across the drawing room to the dancing hall
where denisov was sitting on the same chair by the clavichord with his
face in his hands

he jumped up at the sound of her light step

nataly he said moving with rapid steps toward her decide my fate
it is in your hands

vasíli dmítrich im so sorry for you no but you are so nice
but it wont donot that but as a friend i shall always love you

denisov bent over her hand and she heard strange sounds she did not
understand she kissed his rough curly black head at this instant they
heard the quick rustle of the countess dress she came up to them

vasíli dmítrich i thank you for the honor she said with an
embarrassed voice though it sounded severe to denisovbut my daughter
is so young and i thought that as my sons friend you would have
addressed yourself first to me in that case you would not have obliged
me to give this refusal

countess said denisov with downcast eyes and a guilty face he
tried to say more but faltered

natásha could not remain calm seeing him in such a plight she began to
sob aloud

countess i have done wong denisov went on in an unsteady voice
but believe me i so adore your daughter and all your family that i
would give my life twice over he looked at the countess and seeing
her severe face said well goodby countess and kissing her hand
he left the room with quick resolute strides without looking at
natásha

next day rostóv saw denisov off he did not wish to stay another day in
moscow all denisovs moscow friends gave him a farewell entertainment
at the gypsies with the result that he had no recollection of how he
was put in the sleigh or of the first three stages of his journey

after denisovs departure rostóv spent another fortnight in moscow
without going out of the house waiting for the money his father could
not at once raise and he spent most of his time in the girls room

sónya was more tender and devoted to him than ever it was as if she
wanted to show him that his losses were an achievement that made her
love him all the more but nicholas now considered himself unworthy of
her

he filled the girls albums with verses and music and having at last
sent dólokhov the whole fortythree thousand rubles and received his
receipt he left at the end of november without taking leave of any of
his acquaintances to overtake his regiment which was already in poland





book five





chapter i

after his interview with his wife pierre left for petersburg at the
torzhok post station either there were no horses or the postmaster
would not supply them pierre was obliged to wait without undressing
he lay down on the leather sofa in front of a round table put his big
feet in their overboots on the table and began to reflect

will you have the portmanteaus brought in and a bed got ready and
tea asked his valet

pierre gave no answer for he neither heard nor saw anything he had
begun to think of the last station and was still pondering on the same
questionone so important that he took no notice of what went on around
him not only was he indifferent as to whether he got to petersburg
earlier or later or whether he secured accommodation at this station
but compared to the thoughts that now occupied him it was a matter of
indifference whether he remained there for a few hours or for the rest
of his life

the postmaster his wife the valet and a peasant woman selling torzhok
embroidery came into the room offering their services without changing
his careless attitude pierre looked at them over his spectacles unable
to understand what they wanted or how they could go on living without
having solved the problems that so absorbed him he had been engrossed
by the same thoughts ever since the day he returned from sokolniki after
the duel and had spent that first agonizing sleepless night but now
in the solitude of the journey they seized him with special force no
matter what he thought about he always returned to these same questions
which he could not solve and yet could not cease to ask himself it was
as if the thread of the chief screw which held his life together were
stripped so that the screw could not get in or out but went on turning
uselessly in the same place

the postmaster came in and began obsequiously to beg his excellency to
wait only two hours when come what might he would let his excellency
have the courier horses it was plain that he was lying and only wanted
to get more money from the traveler

is this good or bad pierre asked himself it is good for me bad for
another traveler and for himself its unavoidable because he needs
money for food the man said an officer had once given him a thrashing
for letting a private traveler have the courier horses but the officer
thrashed him because he had to get on as quickly as possible and i
continued pierre shot dólokhov because i considered myself injured
and louis xvi was executed because they considered him a criminal and a
year later they executed those who executed himalso for some reason
what is bad what is good what should one love and what hate what does
one live for and what am i what is life and what is death what power
governs all

there was no answer to any of these questions except one and that not
a logical answer and not at all a reply to them the answer was youll
die and all will end youll die and know all or cease asking but
dying was also dreadful

the torzhok peddler woman in a whining voice went on offering her
wares especially a pair of goatskin slippers i have hundreds of
rubles i dont know what to do with and she stands in her tattered
cloak looking timidly at me he thought and what does she want the
money for as if that money could add a hairs breadth to happiness or
peace of mind can anything in the world make her or me less a prey to
evil and deathdeath which ends all and must come today or tomorrowat
any rate in an instant as compared with eternity and again he twisted
the screw with the stripped thread and again it turned uselessly in the
same place

his servant handed him a halfcut novel in the form of letters by
madame de souza he began reading about the sufferings and virtuous
struggles of a certain emilie de mansfeld and why did she resist her
seducer when she loved him he thought god could not have put into
her heart an impulse that was against his will my wifeas she once
wasdid not struggle and perhaps she was right nothing has been found
out nothing discovered pierre again said to himself all we can know
is that we know nothing and thats the height of human wisdom

everything within and around him seemed confused senseless and
repellent yet in this very repugnance to all his circumstances pierre
found a kind of tantalizing satisfaction

i make bold to ask your excellency to move a little for this
gentleman said the postmaster entering the room followed by another
traveler also detained for lack of horses

the newcomer was a short largeboned yellowfaced wrinkled old man
with gray bushy eyebrows overhanging bright eyes of an indefinite
grayish color

pierre took his feet off the table stood up and lay down on a bed that
had been got ready for him glancing now and then at the newcomer who
with a gloomy and tired face was wearily taking off his wraps with the
aid of his servant and not looking at pierre with a pair of felt boots
on his thin bony legs and keeping on a worn nankeencovered sheepskin
coat the traveler sat down on the sofa leaned back his big head with
its broad temples and closecropped hair and looked at bezúkhov the
stern shrewd and penetrating expression of that look struck pierre he
felt a wish to speak to the stranger but by the time he had made up his
mind to ask him a question about the roads the traveler had closed his
eyes his shriveled old hands were folded and on the finger of one of
them pierre noticed a large cast iron ring with a seal representing a
deaths head the stranger sat without stirring either resting or as
it seemed to pierre sunk in profound and calm meditation his servant
was also a yellow wrinkled old man without beard or mustache
evidently not because he was shaven but because they had never grown
this active old servant was unpacking the travelers canteen and
preparing tea he brought in a boiling samovar when everything was
ready the stranger opened his eyes moved to the table filled a
tumbler with tea for himself and one for the beardless old man to whom
he passed it pierre began to feel a sense of uneasiness and the need
even the inevitability of entering into conversation with this
stranger

the servant brought back his tumbler turned upside down  with an
unfinished bit of nibbled sugar and asked if anything more would be
wanted

 to indicate he did not want more tea

no give me the book said the stranger

the servant handed him a book which pierre took to be a devotional work
and the traveler became absorbed in it pierre looked at him all at
once the stranger closed the book putting in a marker and again
leaning with his arms on the back of the sofa sat in his former
position with his eyes shut pierre looked at him and had not time to
turn away when the old man opening his eyes fixed his steady and
severe gaze straight on pierres face

pierre felt confused and wished to avoid that look but the bright old
eyes attracted him irresistibly





chapter ii

i have the pleasure of addressing count bezúkhov if i am not
mistaken said the stranger in a deliberate and loud voice

pierre looked silently and inquiringly at him over his spectacles

i have heard of you my dear sir continued the stranger and of your
misfortune he seemed to emphasize the last word as if to sayyes
misfortune call it what you please i know that what happened to you in
moscow was a misfortunei regret it very much my dear sir

pierre flushed and hurriedly putting his legs down from the bed bent
forward toward the old man with a forced and timid smile

i have not referred to this out of curiosity my dear sir but for
greater reasons

he paused his gaze still on pierre and moved aside on the sofa by way
of inviting the other to take a seat beside him pierre felt reluctant
to enter into conversation with this old man but submitting to him
involuntarily came up and sat down beside him

you are unhappy my dear sir the stranger continued you are young
and i am old i should like to help you as far as lies in my power

oh yes said pierre with a forced smile i am very grateful to you
where are you traveling from

the strangers face was not genial it was even cold and severe but in
spite of this both the face and words of his new acquaintance were
irresistibly attractive to pierre

but if for reason you dont feel inclined to talk to me said the old
man say so my dear sir and he suddenly smiled in an unexpected and
tenderly paternal way

oh no not at all on the contrary i am very glad to make your
acquaintance said pierre and again glancing at the strangers hands
he looked more closely at the ring with its skulla masonic sign

allow me to ask he said are you a mason

yes i belong to the brotherhood of the freemasons said the stranger
looking deeper and deeper into pierres eyes and in their name and my
own i hold out a brotherly hand to you

i am afraid said pierre smiling and wavering between the confidence
the personality of the freemason inspired in him and his own habit of
ridiculing the masonic beliefsi am afraid i am very far from
understandinghow am i to put iti am afraid my way of looking at the
world is so opposed to yours that we shall not understand one another

i know your outlook said the mason and the view of life you
mention and which you think is the result of your own mental efforts
is the one held by the majority of people and is the invariable fruit
of pride indolence and ignorance forgive me my dear sir but if i
had not known it i should not have addressed you your view of life is a
regrettable delusion

just as i may suppose you to be deluded said pierre with a faint
smile

i should never dare to say that i know the truth said the mason
whose words struck pierre more and more by their precision and firmness
no one can attain to truth by himself only by laying stone on stone
with the cooperation of all by the millions of generations from our
forefather adam to our own times is that temple reared which is to be a
worthy dwelling place of the great god he added and closed his eyes

i ought to tell you that i do not believe do not believe in god
said pierre regretfully and with an effort feeling it essential to
speak the whole truth

the mason looked intently at pierre and smiled as a rich man with
millions in hand might smile at a poor fellow who told him that he poor
man had not the five rubles that would make him happy

yes you do not know him my dear sir said the mason you cannot
know him you do not know him and that is why you are unhappy

yes yes i am unhappy assented pierre but what am i to do

you know him not my dear sir and so you are very unhappy you do not
know him but he is here he is in me he is in my words he is in thee
and even in those blasphemous words thou hast just uttered pronounced
the mason in a stern and tremulous voice

he paused and sighed evidently trying to calm himself

if he were not he said quietly you and i would not be speaking of
him my dear sir of what of whom are we speaking whom hast thou
denied he suddenly asked with exulting austerity and authority in his
voice who invented him if he did not exist whence came thy
conception of the existence of such an incomprehensible being didst
thou and why did the whole world conceive the idea of the existence of
such an incomprehensible being a being allpowerful eternal and
infinite in all his attributes

he stopped and remained silent for a long time

pierre could not and did not wish to break this silence

he exists but to understand him is hard the mason began again
looking not at pierre but straight before him and turning the leaves of
his book with his old hands which from excitement he could not keep
still if it were a man whose existence thou didst doubt i could bring
him to thee could take him by the hand and show him to thee but how
can i an insignificant mortal show his omnipotence his infinity and
all his mercy to one who is blind or who shuts his eyes that he may not
see or understand him and may not see or understand his own vileness and
sinfulness he paused again who art thou thou dreamest that thou art
wise because thou couldst utter those blasphemous words he went on
with a somber and scornful smile and thou art more foolish and
unreasonable than a little child who playing with the parts of a
skillfully made watch dares to say that as he does not understand its
use he does not believe in the master who made it to know him is
hard for ages from our forefather adam to our own day we labor to
attain that knowledge and are still infinitely far from our aim but in
our lack of understanding we see only our weakness and his
greatness

pierre listened with swelling heart gazing into the masons face with
shining eyes not interrupting or questioning him but believing with
his whole soul what the stranger said whether he accepted the wise
reasoning contained in the masons words or believed as a child
believes in the speakers tone of conviction and earnestness or the
tremor of the speakers voicewhich sometimes almost brokeor those
brilliant aged eyes grown old in this conviction or the calm firmness
and certainty of his vocation which radiated from his whole being and
which struck pierre especially by contrast with his own dejection and
hopelessnessat any rate pierre longed with his whole soul to believe
and he did believe and felt a joyful sense of comfort regeneration
and return to life

he is not to be apprehended by reason but by life said the mason

i do not understand said pierre feeling with dismay doubts
reawakening he was afraid of any want of clearness any weakness in
the masons arguments he dreaded not to be able to believe in him i
dont understand he said how it is that the mind of man cannot
attain the knowledge of which you speak

the mason smiled with his gentle fatherly smile

the highest wisdom and truth are like the purest liquid we may wish to
imbibe he said can i receive that pure liquid into an impure vessel
and judge of its purity only by the inner purification of myself can i
retain in some degree of purity the liquid i receive

yes yes that is so said pierre joyfully

the highest wisdom is not founded on reason alone not on those worldly
sciences of physics history chemistry and the like into which
intellectual knowledge is divided the highest wisdom is one the
highest wisdom has but one sciencethe science of the wholethe science
explaining the whole creation and mans place in it to receive that
science it is necessary to purify and renew ones inner self and so
before one can know it is necessary to believe and to perfect ones
self and to attain this end we have the light called conscience that
god has implanted in our souls

yes yes assented pierre

look then at thy inner self with the eyes of the spirit and ask
thyself whether thou art content with thyself what hast thou attained
relying on reason only what art thou you are young you are rich you
are clever you are well educated and what have you done with all these
good gifts are you content with yourself and with your life

no i hate my life pierre muttered wincing

thou hatest it then change it purify thyself and as thou art
purified thou wilt gain wisdom look at your life my dear sir how
have you spent it in riotous orgies and debauchery receiving
everything from society and giving nothing in return you have become
the possessor of wealth how have you used it what have you done for
your neighbor have you ever thought of your tens of thousands of
slaves have you helped them physically and morally no you have
profited by their toil to lead a profligate life that is what you have
done have you chosen a post in which you might be of service to your
neighbor no you have spent your life in idleness then you married my
dear sirtook on yourself responsibility for the guidance of a young
woman and what have you done you have not helped her to find the way
of truth my dear sir but have thrust her into an abyss of deceit and
misery a man offended you and you shot him and you say you do not know
god and hate your life there is nothing strange in that my dear sir

after these words the mason as if tired by his long discourse again
leaned his arms on the back of the sofa and closed his eyes pierre
looked at that aged stern motionless almost lifeless face and moved
his lips without uttering a sound he wished to say yes a vile idle
vicious life but dared not break the silence

the mason cleared his throat huskily as old men do and called his
servant

how about the horses he asked without looking at pierre

the exchange horses have just come answered the servant will you
not rest here

no tell them to harness

can he really be going away leaving me alone without having told me
all and without promising to help me thought pierre rising with
downcast head and he began to pace the room glancing occasionally at
the mason yes i never thought of it but i have led a contemptible
and profligate life though i did not like it and did not want to
thought pierre but this man knows the truth and if he wished to
could disclose it to me

pierre wished to say this to the mason but did not dare to the
traveler having packed his things with his practiced hands began
fastening his coat when he had finished he turned to bezúkhov and
said in a tone of indifferent politeness

where are you going to now my dear sir

i im going to petersburg answered pierre in a childlike
hesitating voice i thank you i agree with all you have said but do
not suppose me to be so bad with my whole soul i wish to be what you
would have me be but i have never had help from anyone but it is i
above all who am to blame for everything help me teach me and
perhaps i may

pierre could not go on he gulped and turned away

the mason remained silent for a long time evidently considering

help comes from god alone he said but such measure of help as our
order can bestow it will render you my dear sir you are going to
petersburg hand this to count willarski he took out his notebook and
wrote a few words on a large sheet of paper folded in four allow me
to give you a piece of advice when you reach the capital first of all
devote some time to solitude and selfexamination and do not resume your
former way of life and now i wish you a good journey my dear sir he
added seeing that his servant had entered and success

the traveler was joseph alexeevich bazdeev as pierre saw from the
postmasters book bazdeev had been one of the bestknown freemasons and
martinists even in novikovs time for a long while after he had gone
pierre did not go to bed or order horses but paced up and down the room
pondering over his vicious past and with a rapturous sense of beginning
anew pictured to himself the blissful irreproachable virtuous future
that seemed to him so easy it seemed to him that he had been vicious
only because he had somehow forgotten how good it is to be virtuous not
a trace of his former doubts remained in his soul he firmly believed in
the possibility of the brotherhood of men united in the aim of
supporting one another in the path of virtue and that is how
freemasonry presented itself to him





chapter iii

on reaching petersburg pierre did not let anyone know of his arrival he
went nowhere and spent whole days in reading thomas a kempis whose book
had been sent him by someone unknown one thing he continually realized
as he read that book the joy hitherto unknown to him of believing in
the possibility of attaining perfection and in the possibility of
active brotherly love among men which joseph alexeevich had revealed to
him a week after his arrival the young polish count willarski whom
pierre had known slightly in petersburg society came into his room one
evening in the official and ceremonious manner in which dólokhovs
second had called on him and having closed the door behind him and
satisfied himself that there was nobody else in the room addressed
pierre

i have come to you with a message and an offer count he said without
sitting down a person of very high standing in our brotherhood has
made application for you to be received into our order before the usual
term and has proposed to me to be your sponsor i consider it a sacred
duty to fulfill that persons wishes do you wish to enter the
brotherhood of freemasons under my sponsorship

the cold austere tone of this man whom he had almost always before met
at balls amiably smiling in the society of the most brilliant women
surprised pierre

yes i do wish it said he

willarski bowed his head

one more question count he said which i beg you to answer in all
sinceritynot as a future mason but as an honest man have you renounced
your former convictionsdo you believe in god

pierre considered

yes yes i believe in god he said

in that case began willarski but pierre interrupted him

yes i do believe in god he repeated

in that case we can go said willarski my carriage is at your
service

willarski was silent throughout the drive to pierres inquiries as to
what he must do and how he should answer willarski only replied that
brothers more worthy than he would test him and that pierre had only to
tell the truth

having entered the courtyard of a large house where the lodge had its
headquarters and having ascended a dark staircase they entered a small
welllit anteroom where they took off their cloaks without the aid of a
servant from there they passed into another room a man in strange
attire appeared at the door willarski stepping toward him said
something to him in french in an undertone and then went up to a small
wardrobe in which pierre noticed garments such as he had never seen
before having taken a kerchief from the cupboard willarski bound
pierres eyes with it and tied it in a knot behind catching some hairs
painfully in the knot then he drew his face down kissed him and
taking him by the hand led him forward the hairs tied in the knot hurt
pierre and there were lines of pain on his face and a shamefaced smile
his huge figure with arms hanging down and with a puckered though
smiling face moved after willarski with uncertain timid steps

having led him about ten paces willarski stopped

whatever happens to you he said you must bear it all manfully if
you have firmly resolved to join our brotherhood pierre nodded
affirmatively when you hear a knock at the door you will uncover
your eyes added willarski i wish you courage and success and
pressing pierres hand he went out

left alone pierre went on smiling in the same way once or twice he
shrugged his shoulders and raised his hand to the kerchief as if
wishing to take it off but let it drop again the five minutes spent
with his eyes bandaged seemed to him an hour his arms felt numb his
legs almost gave way it seemed to him that he was tired out he
experienced a variety of most complex sensations he felt afraid of what
would happen to him and still more afraid of showing his fear he felt
curious to know what was going to happen and what would be revealed to
him but most of all he felt joyful that the moment had come when he
would at last start on that path of regeneration and on the actively
virtuous life of which he had been dreaming since he met joseph
alexeevich loud knocks were heard at the door pierre took the bandage
off his eyes and glanced around him the room was in black darkness
only a small lamp was burning inside something white pierre went nearer
and saw that the lamp stood on a black table on which lay an open book
the book was the gospel and the white thing with the lamp inside was a
human skull with its cavities and teeth after reading the first words
of the gospel in the beginning was the word and the word was with
god pierre went round the table and saw a large open box filled with
something it was a coffin with bones inside he was not at all
surprised by what he saw hoping to enter on an entirely new life quite
unlike the old one he expected everything to be unusual even more
unusual than what he was seeing a skull a coffin the gospelit seemed
to him that he had expected all this and even more trying to stimulate
his emotions he looked around god death love the brotherhood of
man he kept saying to himself associating these words with vague yet
joyful ideas the door opened and someone came in

by the dim light to which pierre had already become accustomed he saw
a rather short man having evidently come from the light into the
darkness the man paused then moved with cautious steps toward the
table and placed on it his small leathergloved hands

this short man had on a white leather apron which covered his chest and
part of his legs he had on a kind of necklace above which rose a high
white ruffle outlining his rather long face which was lit up from
below

for what have you come hither asked the newcomer turning in pierres
direction at a slight rustle made by the latter why have you who do
not believe in the truth of the light and who have not seen the light
come here what do you seek from us wisdom virtue enlightenment

at the moment the door opened and the stranger came in pierre felt a
sense of awe and veneration such as he had experienced in his boyhood at
confession he felt himself in the presence of one socially a complete
stranger yet nearer to him through the brotherhood of man with bated
breath and beating heart he moved toward the rhetor by which name the
brother who prepared a seeker for entrance into the brotherhood was
known drawing nearer he recognized in the rhetor a man he knew
smolyaninov and it mortified him to think that the newcomer was an
acquaintancehe wished him simply a brother and a virtuous instructor
for a long time he could not utter a word so that the rhetor had to
repeat his question

yes i i desire regeneration pierre uttered with difficulty

very well said smolyaninov and went on at once have you any idea
of the means by which our holy order will help you to reach your aim
said he quietly and quickly

i hope for guidance help in regeneration said pierre
with a trembling voice and some difficulty in utterance due to his
excitement and to being unaccustomed to speak of abstract matters in
russian

what is your conception of freemasonry

i imagine that freemasonry is the fraternity and equality of men who
have virtuous aims said pierre feeling ashamed of the inadequacy of
his words for the solemnity of the moment as he spoke i imagine

good said the rhetor quickly apparently satisfied with this answer
have you sought for means of attaining your aim in religion

no i considered it erroneous and did not follow it said pierre so
softly that the rhetor did not hear him and asked him what he was
saying i have been an atheist answered pierre

you are seeking for truth in order to follow its laws in your life
therefore you seek wisdom and virtue is that not so said the rhetor
after a moments pause

yes yes assented pierre

the rhetor cleared his throat crossed his gloved hands on his breast
and began to speak

now i must disclose to you the chief aim of our order he said and
if this aim coincides with yours you may enter our brotherhood with
profit the first and chief object of our order the foundation on which
it rests and which no human power can destroy is the preservation and
handing on to posterity of a certain important mystery which has come
down to us from the remotest ages even from the first mana mystery on
which perhaps the fate of mankind depends but since this mystery is of
such a nature that nobody can know or use it unless he be prepared by
long and diligent selfpurification not everyone can hope to attain it
quickly hence we have a secondary aim that of preparing our members as
much as possible to reform their hearts to purify and enlighten their
minds by means handed on to us by tradition from those who have striven
to attain this mystery and thereby to render them capable of receiving
it

by purifying and regenerating our members we try thirdly to improve
the whole human race offering it in our members an example of piety and
virtue and thereby try with all our might to combat the evil which
sways the world think this over and i will come to you again

to combat the evil which sways the world pierre repeated and a
mental image of his future activity in this direction rose in his mind
he imagined men such as he had himself been a fortnight ago and he
addressed an edifying exhortation to them he imagined to himself
vicious and unfortunate people whom he would assist by word and deed
imagined oppressors whose victims he would rescue of the three objects
mentioned by the rhetor this last that of improving mankind
especially appealed to pierre the important mystery mentioned by the
rhetor though it aroused his curiosity did not seem to him essential
and the second aim that of purifying and regenerating himself did not
much interest him because at that moment he felt with delight that he
was already perfectly cured of his former faults and was ready for all
that was good

half an hour later the rhetor returned to inform the seeker of the
seven virtues corresponding to the seven steps of solomons temple
which every freemason should cultivate in himself these virtues were
 discretion the keeping of the secrets of the order  obedience to
those of higher ranks in the order  morality  love of mankind
courage  generosity  the love of death

in the seventh place try by the frequent thought of death the
rhetor said to bring yourself to regard it not as a dreaded foe but
as a friend that frees the soul grown weary in the labors of virtue from
this distressful life and leads it to its place of recompense and
peace

yes that must be so thought pierre when after these words the
rhetor went away leaving him to solitary meditation it must be so
but i am still so weak that i love my life the meaning of which is only
now gradually opening before me but five of the other virtues which
pierre recalled counting them on his fingers he felt already in his
soul courage generosity morality love of mankind and especially
obediencewhich did not even seem to him a virtue but a joy he now
felt so glad to be free from his own lawlessness and to submit his will
to those who knew the indubitable truth he forgot what the seventh
virtue was and could not recall it

the third time the rhetor came back more quickly and asked pierre
whether he was still firm in his intention and determined to submit to
all that would be required of him

i am ready for everything said pierre

i must also inform you said the rhetor that our order delivers its
teaching not in words only but also by other means which may perhaps
have a stronger effect on the sincere seeker after wisdom and virtue
than mere words this chamber with what you see therein should already
have suggested to your heart if it is sincere more than words could
do you will perhaps also see in your further initiation a like method
of enlightenment our order imitates the ancient societies that
explained their teaching by hieroglyphics a hieroglyph said the
rhetor is an emblem of something not cognizable by the senses but
which possesses qualities resembling those of the symbol

pierre knew very well what a hieroglyph was but dared not speak he
listened to the rhetor in silence feeling from all he said that his
ordeal was about to begin

if you are resolved i must begin your initiation said the rhetor
coming closer to pierre in token of generosity i ask you to give me
all your valuables

but i have nothing here replied pierre supposing that he was asked
to give up all he possessed

what you have with you watch money rings

pierre quickly took out his purse and watch but could not manage for
some time to get the wedding ring off his fat finger when that had been
done the rhetor said

in token of obedience i ask you to undress

pierre took off his coat waistcoat and left boot according to the
rhetors instructions the mason drew the shirt back from pierres left
breast and stooping down pulled up the left leg of his trousers to
above the knee pierre hurriedly began taking off his right boot also
and was going to tuck up the other trouser leg to save this stranger the
trouble but the mason told him that was not necessary and gave him a
slipper for his left foot with a childlike smile of embarrassment
doubt and selfderision which appeared on his face against his will
pierre stood with his arms hanging down and legs apart before his
brother rhetor and awaited his further commands

and now in token of candor i ask you to reveal to me your chief
passion said the latter

my passion i have had so many replied pierre

that passion which more than all others caused you to waver on the path
of virtue said the mason

pierre paused seeking a reply

wine gluttony idleness laziness irritability anger women he
went over his vices in his mind not knowing to which of them to give
the preeminence

women he said in a low scarcely audible voice

the mason did not move and for a long time said nothing after this
answer at last he moved up to pierre and taking the kerchief that lay
on the table again bound his eyes

for the last time i say to youturn all your attention upon yourself
put a bridle on your senses and seek blessedness not in passion but in
your own heart the source of blessedness is not without us but
within

pierre had already long been feeling in himself that refreshing source
of blessedness which now flooded his heart with glad emotion





chapter iv

soon after this there came into the dark chamber to fetch pierre not
the rhetor but pierres sponsor willarski whom he recognized by his
voice to fresh questions as to the firmness of his resolution pierre
replied yes yes i agree and with a beaming childlike smile his
fat chest uncovered stepping unevenly and timidly in one slippered and
one booted foot he advanced while willarski held a sword to his bare
chest he was conducted from that room along passages that turned
backwards and forwards and was at last brought to the doors of the
lodge willarski coughed he was answered by the masonic knock with
mallets the doors opened before them a bass voice pierre was still
blindfolded questioned him as to who he was when and where he was
born and so on then he was again led somewhere still blindfolded and
as they went along he was told allegories of the toils of his
pilgrimage of holy friendship of the eternal architect of the
universe and of the courage with which he should endure toils and
dangers during these wanderings pierre noticed that he was spoken of
now as the seeker now as the sufferer and now as the postulant
to the accompaniment of various knockings with mallets and swords as he
was being led up to some object he noticed a hesitation and uncertainty
among his conductors he heard those around him disputing in whispers
and one of them insisting that he should be led along a certain carpet
after that they took his right hand placed it on something and told
him to hold a pair of compasses to his left breast with the other hand
and to repeat after someone who read aloud an oath of fidelity to the
laws of the order the candles were then extinguished and some spirit
lighted as pierre knew by the smell and he was told that he would now
see the lesser light the bandage was taken off his eyes and by the
faint light of the burning spirit pierre as in a dream saw several
men standing before him wearing aprons like the rhetors and holding
swords in their hands pointed at his breast among them stood a man
whose white shirt was stained with blood on seeing this pierre moved
forward with his breast toward the swords meaning them to pierce it
but the swords were drawn back from him and he was at once blindfolded
again

now thou hast seen the lesser light uttered a voice then the candles
were relit and he was told that he would see the full light the bandage
was again removed and more than ten voices said together sic transit
gloria mundi

pierre gradually began to recover himself and looked about at the room
and at the people in it round a long table covered with black sat some
twelve men in garments like those he had already seen some of them
pierre had met in petersburg society in the presidents chair sat a
young man he did not know with a peculiar cross hanging from his neck
on his right sat the italian abbé whom pierre had met at anna pávlovnas
two years before there were also present a very distinguished dignitary
and a swiss who had formerly been tutor at the kurágins all maintained
a solemn silence listening to the words of the president who held a
mallet in his hand let into the wall was a starshaped light at one
side of the table was a small carpet with various figures worked upon
it at the other was something resembling an altar on which lay a
testament and a skull round it stood seven large candlesticks like
those used in churches two of the brothers led pierre up to the altar
placed his feet at right angles and bade him lie down saying that he
must prostrate himself at the gates of the temple

he must first receive the trowel whispered one of the brothers

oh hush please said another

pierre perplexed looked round with his shortsighted eyes without
obeying and suddenly doubts arose in his mind where am i what am i
doing arent they laughing at me shant i be ashamed to remember
this but these doubts only lasted a moment pierre glanced at the
serious faces of those around remembered all he had already gone
through and realized that he could not stop halfway he was aghast at
his hesitation and trying to arouse his former devotional feeling
prostrated himself before the gates of the temple and really the
feeling of devotion returned to him even more strongly than before when
he had lain there some time he was told to get up and a white leather
apron such as the others wore was put on him he was given a trowel
and three pairs of gloves and then the grand master addressed him he
told him that he should try to do nothing to stain the whiteness of that
apron which symbolized strength and purity then of the unexplained
trowel he told him to toil with it to cleanse his own heart from vice
and indulgently to smooth with it the heart of his neighbor as to the
first pair of gloves a mans he said that pierre could not know their
meaning but must keep them the second pair of mans gloves he was to
wear at the meetings and finally of the third a pair of womens
gloves he said dear brother these womans gloves are intended for
you too give them to the woman whom you shall honor most of all this
gift will be a pledge of your purity of heart to her whom you select to
be your worthy helpmeet in masonry and after a pause he added but
beware dear brother that these gloves do not deck hands that are
unclean while the grand master said these last words it seemed to
pierre that he grew embarrassed pierre himself grew still more
confused blushed like a child till tears came to his eyes began
looking about him uneasily and an awkward pause followed

this silence was broken by one of the brethren who led pierre up to the
rug and began reading to him from a manuscript book an explanation of
all the figures on it the sun the moon a hammer a plumb line a
trowel a rough stone and a squared stone a pillar three windows and
so on then a place was assigned to pierre he was shown the signs of
the lodge told the password and at last was permitted to sit down the
grand master began reading the statutes they were very long and
pierre from joy agitation and embarrassment was not in a state to
understand what was being read he managed to follow only the last words
of the statutes and these remained in his mind

in our temples we recognize no other distinctions read the grand
master but those between virtue and vice beware of making any
distinctions which may infringe equality fly to a brothers aid whoever
he may be exhort him who goeth astray raise him that falleth never
bear malice or enmity toward thy brother be kindly and courteous
kindle in all hearts the flame of virtue share thy happiness with thy
neighbor and may envy never dim the purity of that bliss forgive thy
enemy do not avenge thyself except by doing him good thus fulfilling
the highest law thou shalt regain traces of the ancient dignity which
thou hast lost

he finished and getting up embraced and kissed pierre who with tears
of joy in his eyes looked round him not knowing how to answer the
congratulations and greetings from acquaintances that met him on all
sides he acknowledged no acquaintances but saw in all these men only
brothers and burned with impatience to set to work with them

the grand master rapped with his mallet all the masons sat down in
their places and one of them read an exhortation on the necessity of
humility

the grand master proposed that the last duty should be performed and
the distinguished dignitary who bore the title of collector of alms
went round to all the brothers pierre would have liked to subscribe all
he had but fearing that it might look like pride subscribed the same
amount as the others

the meeting was at an end and on reaching home pierre felt as if he had
returned from a long journey on which he had spent dozens of years had
become completely changed and had quite left behind his former habits
and way of life





chapter v

the day after he had been received into the lodge pierre was sitting at
home reading a book and trying to fathom the significance of the square
one side of which symbolized god another moral things a third physical
things and the fourth a combination of these now and then his
attention wandered from the book and the square and he formed in
imagination a new plan of life on the previous evening at the lodge he
had heard that a rumor of his duel had reached the emperor and that it
would be wiser for him to leave petersburg pierre proposed going to his
estates in the south and there attending to the welfare of his serfs he
was joyfully planning this new life when prince vasíli suddenly entered
the room

my dear fellow what have you been up to in moscow why have you
quarreled with hélène mon cher you are under a delusion said prince
vasíli as he entered i know all about it and i can tell you
positively that hélène is as innocent before you as christ was before
the jews

pierre was about to reply but prince vasíli interrupted him

and why didnt you simply come straight to me as to a friend i know
all about it and understand it all he said you behaved as becomes a
man who values his honor perhaps too hastily but we wont go into
that but consider the position in which you are placing her and me in
the eyes of society and even of the court he added lowering his
voice she is living in moscow and you are here remember dear boy
and he drew pierres arm downwards it is simply a misunderstanding i
expect you feel it so yourself let us write her a letter at once and
shell come here and all will be explained or else my dear boy let me
tell you its quite likely youll have to suffer for it

prince vasíli gave pierre a significant look

i know from reliable sources that the dowager empress is taking a keen
interest in the whole affair you know she is very gracious to hélène

pierre tried several times to speak but on one hand prince vasíli did
not let him and on the other pierre himself feared to begin to speak
in the tone of decided refusal and disagreement in which he had firmly
resolved to answer his fatherinlaw moreover the words of the masonic
statutes be kindly and courteous recurred to him he blinked went
red got up and sat down again struggling with himself to do what was
for him the most difficult thing in lifeto say an unpleasant thing to a
mans face to say what the other whoever he might be did not expect
he was so used to submitting to prince vasílis tone of careless self
assurance that he felt he would be unable to withstand it now but he
also felt that on what he said now his future dependedwhether he would
follow the same old road or that new path so attractively shown him by
the masons on which he firmly believed he would be reborn to a new
life

now dear boy said prince vasíli playfully say yes and ill
write to her myself and we will kill the fatted calf

but before prince vasíli had finished his playful speech pierre
without looking at him and with a kind of fury that made him like his
father muttered in a whisper

prince i did not ask you here go please go and he jumped up and
opened the door for him

go he repeated amazed at himself and glad to see the look of
confusion and fear that showed itself on prince vasílis face

whats the matter with you are you ill

go the quivering voice repeated and prince vasíli had to go without
receiving any explanation

a week later pierre having taken leave of his new friends the masons
and leaving large sums of money with them for alms went away to his
estates his new brethren gave him letters to the kiev and odessa masons
and promised to write to him and guide him in his new activity





chapter vi

the duel between pierre and dólokhov was hushed up and in spite of the
emperors severity regarding duels at that time neither the principals
nor their seconds suffered for it but the story of the duel confirmed
by pierres rupture with his wife was the talk of society pierre who
had been regarded with patronizing condescension when he was an
illegitimate son and petted and extolled when he was the best match in
russia had sunk greatly in the esteem of society after his
marriagewhen the marriageable daughters and their mothers had nothing
to hope from himespecially as he did not know how and did not wish to
court societys favor now he alone was blamed for what had happened he
was said to be insanely jealous and subject like his father to fits of
bloodthirsty rage and when after pierres departure hélène returned to
petersburg she was received by all her acquaintances not only
cordially but even with a shade of deference due to her misfortune
when conversation turned on her husband hélène assumed a dignified
expression which with characteristic tact she had acquired though she
did not understand its significance this expression suggested that she
had resolved to endure her troubles uncomplainingly and that her husband
was a cross laid upon her by god prince vasíli expressed his opinion
more openly he shrugged his shoulders when pierre was mentioned and
pointing to his forehead remarked

a bit touchedi always said so

i said from the first declared anna pávlovna referring to pierre i
said at the time and before anyone else she insisted on her priority
that that senseless young man was spoiled by the depraved ideas of
these days i said so even at the time when everybody was in raptures
about him when he had just returned from abroad and when if you
remember he posed as a sort of marat at one of my soirees and how has
it ended i was against this marriage even then and foretold all that
has happened

anna pávlovna continued to give on free evenings the same kind of
soirees as beforesuch as she alone had the gift of arrangingat which
was to be found the cream of really good society the bloom of the
intellectual essence of petersburg as she herself put it besides this
refined selection of society anna pávlovnas receptions were also
distinguished by the fact that she always presented some new and
interesting person to the visitors and that nowhere else was the state
of the political thermometer of legitimate petersburg court society so
dearly and distinctly indicated

toward the end of  when all the sad details of napoleons
destruction of the prussian army at jena and auerstadt and the surrender
of most of the prussian fortresses had been received when our troops
had already entered prussia and our second war with napoleon was
beginning anna pávlovna gave one of her soirees the cream of really
good society consisted of the fascinating hélène forsaken by her
husband mortemart the delightful prince hippolyte who had just
returned from vienna two diplomatists the old aunt a young man
referred to in that drawing room as a man of great merit un homme de
beaucoup de merite a newly appointed maid of honor and her mother and
several other less noteworthy persons

the novelty anna pávlovna was setting before her guests that evening was
borís drubetskóy who had just arrived as a special messenger from the
prussian army and was aidedecamp to a very important personage

the temperature shown by the political thermometer to the company that
evening was this

whatever the european sovereigns and commanders may do to countenance
bonaparte and to cause me and us in general annoyance and
mortification our opinion of bonaparte cannot alter we shall not cease
to express our sincere views on that subject and can only say to the
king of prussia and others so much the worse for you tu las voulu
george dandin thats all we have to say about it

when borís who was to be served up to the guests entered the drawing
room almost all the company had assembled and the conversation guided
by anna pávlovna was about our diplomatic relations with austria and
the hope of an alliance with her

borís grown more manly and looking fresh rosy and selfpossessed
entered the drawing room elegantly dressed in the uniform of an aidede
camp and was duly conducted to pay his respects to the aunt and then
brought back to the general circle

anna pávlovna gave him her shriveled hand to kiss and introduced him to
several persons whom he did not know giving him a whispered description
of each

prince hippolyte kurágin m krug the charge daffaires from
copenhagena profound intellect and simply mr shitova man of great
meritthis of the man usually so described

thanks to anna mikháylovnas efforts his own tastes and the
peculiarities of his reserved nature borís had managed during his
service to place himself very advantageously he was aidedecamp to a
very important personage had been sent on a very important mission to
prussia and had just returned from there as a special messenger he had
become thoroughly conversant with that unwritten code with which he had
been so pleased at olmutz and according to which an ensign might rank
incomparably higher than a general and according to which what was
needed for success in the service was not effort or work or courage or
perseverance but only the knowledge of how to get on with those who can
grant rewards and he was himself often surprised at the rapidity of his
success and at the inability of others to understand these things in
consequence of this discovery his whole manner of life all his
relations with old friends all his plans for his future were
completely altered he was not rich but would spend his last groat to
be better dressed than others and would rather deprive himself of many
pleasures than allow himself to be seen in a shabby equipage or appear
in the streets of petersburg in an old uniform he made friends with and
sought the acquaintance of only those above him in position and who
could therefore be of use to him he liked petersburg and despised
moscow the remembrance of the rostóvs house and of his childish love
for natásha was unpleasant to him and he had not once been to see the
rostóvs since the day of his departure for the army to be in anna
pávlovnas drawing room he considered an important step up in the
service and he at once understood his role letting his hostess make
use of whatever interest he had to offer he himself carefully scanned
each face appraising the possibilities of establishing intimacy with
each of those present and the advantages that might accrue he took the
seat indicated to him beside the fair hélène and listened to the general
conversation

vienna considers the bases of the proposed treaty so unattainable that
not even a continuity of most brilliant successes would secure them and
she doubts the means we have of gaining them that is the actual phrase
used by the vienna cabinet said the danish charge daffaires

the doubt is flattering said the man of profound intellect with a
subtle smile

we must distinguish between the vienna cabinet and the emperor of
austria said mortemart the emperor of austria can never have thought
of such a thing it is only the cabinet that says it

ah my dear vicomte put in anna pávlovna lurope for some reason
she called it urope as if that were a specially refined french
pronunciation which she could allow herself when conversing with a
frenchman lurope ne sera jamais notre alliee sincere

 europe will never be our sincere ally

after that anna pávlovna led up to the courage and firmness of the king
of prussia in order to draw borís into the conversation

borís listened attentively to each of the speakers awaiting his turn
but managed meanwhile to look round repeatedly at his neighbor the
beautiful hélène whose eyes several times met those of the handsome
young aidedecamp with a smile

speaking of the position of prussia anna pávlovna very naturally asked
borís to tell them about his journey to glogau and in what state he
found the prussian army borís speaking with deliberation told them in
pure correct french many interesting details about the armies and the
court carefully abstaining from expressing an opinion of his own about
the facts he was recounting for some time he engrossed the general
attention and anna pávlovna felt that the novelty she had served up was
received with pleasure by all her visitors the greatest attention of
all to borís narrative was shown by hélène she asked him several
questions about his journey and seemed greatly interested in the state
of the prussian army as soon as he had finished she turned to him with
her usual smile

you absolutely must come and see me she said in a tone that implied
that for certain considerations he could not know of this was
absolutely necessary

on tuesday between eight and nine it will give me great pleasure

borís promised to fulfill her wish and was about to begin a conversation
with her when anna pávlovna called him away on the pretext that her
aunt wished to hear him

you know her husband of course said anna pávlovna closing her eyes
and indicating hélène with a sorrowful gesture ah she is such an
unfortunate and charming woman dont mention him before herplease
dont it is too painful for her





chapter vii

when borís and anna pávlovna returned to the others prince hippolyte had
the ear of the company

bending forward in his armchair he said le roi de prusse and having
said this laughed everyone turned toward him

le roi de prusse hippolyte said interrogatively again laughing and
then calmly and seriously sat back in his chair anna pávlovna waited
for him to go on but as he seemed quite decided to say no more she
began to tell of how at potsdam the impious bonaparte had stolen the
sword of frederick the great

it is the sword of frederick the great which i she began but
hippolyte interrupted her with the words le roi de prusse and
again as soon as all turned toward him excused himself and said no
more

anna pávlovna frowned mortemart hippolytes friend addressed him
firmly

come now what about your roi de prusse

hippolyte laughed as if ashamed of laughing

oh its nothing i only wished to say he wanted to repeat a joke
he had heard in vienna and which he had been trying all that evening to
get in i only wished to say that we are wrong to fight pour le roi de
prusse

borís smiled circumspectly so that it might be taken as ironical or
appreciative according to the way the joke was received everybody
laughed

your joke is too bad its witty but unjust said anna pávlovna
shaking her little shriveled finger at him

we are not fighting pour le roi de prusse but for right principles
oh that wicked prince hippolyte she said

the conversation did not flag all evening and turned chiefly on the
political news it became particularly animated toward the end of the
evening when the rewards bestowed by the emperor were mentioned

you know n n received a snuffbox with the portrait last year said
the man of profound intellect why shouldnt s s get the same
distinction

pardon me a snuffbox with the emperors portrait is a reward but not a
distinction said the diplomatista gift rather

there are precedents i may mention schwarzenberg

its impossible replied another

will you bet the ribbon of the order is a different matter

when everybody rose to go hélène who had spoken very little all the
evening again turned to borís asking him in a tone of caressing
significant command to come to her on tuesday

it is of great importance to me she said turning with a smile toward
anna pávlovna and anna pávlovna with the same sad smile with which she
spoke of her exalted patroness supported hélènes wish

it seemed as if from some words borís had spoken that evening about the
prussian army hélène had suddenly found it necessary to see him she
seemed to promise to explain that necessity to him when he came on
tuesday

but on tuesday evening having come to hélènes splendid salon borís
received no clear explanation of why it had been necessary for him to
come there were other guests and the countess talked little to him and
only as he kissed her hand on taking leave said unexpectedly and in a
whisper with a strangely unsmiling face come to dinner tomorrow in
the evening you must come come

during that stay in petersburg borís became an intimate in the
countess house





chapter viii

the war was flaming up and nearing the russian frontier everywhere one
heard curses on bonaparte the enemy of mankind militiamen and
recruits were being enrolled in the villages and from the seat of war
came contradictory news false as usual and therefore variously
interpreted the life of old prince bolkónski prince andrew and
princess mary had greatly changed since

in  the old prince was made one of the eight commanders in chief
then appointed to supervise the enrollment decreed throughout russia
despite the weakness of age which had become particularly noticeable
since the time when he thought his son had been killed he did not think
it right to refuse a duty to which he had been appointed by the emperor
himself and this fresh opportunity for action gave him new energy and
strength he was continually traveling through the three provinces
entrusted to him was pedantic in the fulfillment of his duties severe
to cruel with his subordinates and went into everything down to the
minutest details himself princess mary had ceased taking lessons in
mathematics from her father and when the old prince was at home went to
his study with the wet nurse and little prince nicholas as his
grandfather called him the baby prince nicholas lived with his wet
nurse and nurse savishna in the late princess rooms and princess mary
spent most of the day in the nursery taking a mothers place to her
little nephew as best she could mademoiselle bourienne too seemed
passionately fond of the boy and princess mary often deprived herself
to give her friend the pleasure of dandling the little angelas she
called her nephewand playing with him

near the altar of the church at bald hills there was a chapel over the
tomb of the little princess and in this chapel was a marble monument
brought from italy representing an angel with outspread wings ready to
fly upwards the angels upper lip was slightly raised as though about
to smile and once on coming out of the chapel prince andrew and
princess mary admitted to one another that the angels face reminded
them strangely of the little princess but what was still stranger
though of this prince andrew said nothing to his sister was that in the
expression the sculptor had happened to give the angels face prince
andrew read the same mild reproach he had read on the face of his dead
wife ah why have you done this to me

soon after prince andrews return the old prince made over to him a
large estate bogucharovo about twentyfive miles from bald hills
partly because of the depressing memories associated with bald hills
partly because prince andrew did not always feel equal to bearing with
his fathers peculiarities and partly because he needed solitude
prince andrew made use of bogucharovo began building and spent most of
his time there

after the austerlitz campaign prince andrew had firmly resolved not to
continue his military service and when the war recommenced and
everybody had to serve he took a post under his father in the
recruitment so as to avoid active service the old prince and his son
seemed to have changed roles since the campaign of  the old man
roused by activity expected the best results from the new campaign
while prince andrew on the contrary taking no part in the war and
secretly regretting this saw only the dark side

on february   the old prince set off on one of his circuits
prince andrew remained at bald hills as usual during his fathers
absence little nicholas had been unwell for four days the coachman who
had driven the old prince to town returned bringing papers and letters
for prince andrew

not finding the young prince in his study the valet went with the
letters to princess marys apartments but did not find him there he
was told that the prince had gone to the nursery

if you please your excellency petrusha has brought some papers said
one of the nursemaids to prince andrew who was sitting on a childs
little chair while frowning and with trembling hands he poured drops
from a medicine bottle into a wineglass half full of water

what is it he said crossly and his hand shaking unintentionally he
poured too many drops into the glass he threw the mixture onto the
floor and asked for some more water the maid brought it

there were in the room a childs cot two boxes two armchairs a table
a childs table and the little chair on which prince andrew was
sitting the curtains were drawn and a single candle was burning on the
table screened by a bound music book so that the light did not fall on
the cot

my dear said princess mary addressing her brother from beside the
cot where she was standing better wait a bit later

oh leave off you always talk nonsense and keep putting things offand
this is what comes of it said prince andrew in an exasperated whisper
evidently meaning to wound his sister

my dear really its better not to wake him hes asleep said
the princess in a tone of entreaty

prince andrew got up and went on tiptoe up to the little bed wineglass
in hand

perhaps wed really better not wake him he said hesitating

as you please really i think so but as you please said
princess mary evidently intimidated and confused that her opinion had
prevailed she drew her brothers attention to the maid who was calling
him in a whisper

it was the second night that neither of them had slept watching the boy
who was in a high fever these last days mistrusting their household
doctor and expecting another for whom they had sent to town they had
been trying first one remedy and then another worn out by sleeplessness
and anxiety they threw their burden of sorrow on one another and
reproached and disputed with each other

petrusha has come with papers from your father whispered the maid

prince andrew went out

devil take them he muttered and after listening to the verbal
instructions his father had sent and taking the correspondence and his
fathers letter he returned to the nursery

well he asked

still the same wait for heavens sake karl ivanich always says that
sleep is more important than anything whispered princess mary with a
sigh

prince andrew went up to the child and felt him he was burning hot

confound you and your karl ivanich he took the glass with the drops
and again went up to the cot

andrew dont said princess mary

but he scowled at her angrily though also with suffering in his eyes
and stooped glass in hand over the infant

but i wish it he said i beg yougive it him

princess mary shrugged her shoulders but took the glass submissively and
calling the nurse began giving the medicine the child screamed
hoarsely prince andrew winced and clutching his head went out and sat
down on a sofa in the next room

he still had all the letters in his hand opening them mechanically he
began reading the old prince now and then using abbreviations wrote
in his large elongated hand on blue paper as follows

have just this moment received by special messenger very joyful newsif
its not false bennigsen seems to have obtained a complete victory over
buonaparte at eylau in petersburg everyone is rejoicing and the
rewards sent to the army are innumerable though he is a germani
congratulate him i cant make out what the commander at korchevoa
certain khandrikovis up to till now the additional men and provisions
have not arrived gallop off to him at once and say ill have his head
off if everything is not here in a week have received another letter
about the preussischeylau battle from petenkahe took part in itand
its all true when mischiefmakers dont meddle even a german beats
buonaparte he is said to be fleeing in great disorder mind you gallop
off to korchevo without delay and carry out instructions

prince andrew sighed and broke the seal of another envelope it was a
closely written letter of two sheets from bilibin he folded it up
without reading it and reread his fathers letter ending with the
words gallop off to korchevo and carry out instructions

no pardon me i wont go now till the child is better thought he
going to the door and looking into the nursery

princess mary was still standing by the cot gently rocking the baby

ah yes and what else did he say thats unpleasant thought prince
andrew recalling his fathers letter yes we have gained a victory
over bonaparte just when im not serving yes yes hes always poking
fun at me ah well let him and he began reading bilibins letter
which was written in french he read without understanding half of it
read only to forget if but for a moment what he had too long been
thinking of so painfully to the exclusion of all else





chapter ix

bilibin was now at army headquarters in a diplomatic capacity and
though he wrote in french and used french jests and french idioms he
described the whole campaign with a fearless selfcensure and self
derision genuinely russian bilibin wrote that the obligation of
diplomatic discretion tormented him and he was happy to have in prince
andrew a reliable correspondent to whom he could pour out the bile he
had accumulated at the sight of all that was being done in the army the
letter was old having been written before the battle at preussisch
eylau

since the day of our brilliant success at austerlitz wrote bilibin
as you know my dear prince i never leave headquarters i have
certainly acquired a taste for war and it is just as well for me what
i have seen during these last three months is incredible

i begin ab ovo the enemy of the human race as you know attacks the
prussians the prussians are our faithful allies who have only betrayed
us three times in three years we take up their cause but it turns out
that the enemy of the human race pays no heed to our fine speeches and
in his rude and savage way throws himself on the prussians without
giving them time to finish the parade they had begun and in two twists
of the hand he breaks them to smithereens and installs himself in the
palace at potsdam

i most ardently desire writes the king of prussia to bonaparte
that your majesty should be received and treated in my palace in a
manner agreeable to yourself and in so far as circumstances allowed i
have hastened to take all steps to that end may i have succeeded the
prussian generals pride themselves on being polite to the french and lay
down their arms at the first demand

the head of the garrison at glogau with ten thousand men asks the
king of prussia what he is to do if he is summoned to surrender all
this is absolutely true

in short hoping to settle matters by taking up a warlike attitude it
turns out that we have landed ourselves in war and what is more in war
on our own frontiers with and for the king of prussia we have
everything in perfect order only one little thing is lacking namely a
commander in chief as it was considered that the austerlitz success
might have been more decisive had the commanderinchief not been so
young all our octogenarians were reviewed and of prozorovski and
kamenski the latter was preferred the general comes to us suvórov
like in a kibitka and is received with acclamations of joy and
triumph

on the th the first courier arrives from petersburg the mails are
taken to the field marshals room for he likes to do everything
himself i am called in to help sort the letters and take those meant
for us the field marshal looks on and waits for letters addressed to
him we search but none are to be found the field marshal grows
impatient and sets to work himself and finds letters from the emperor to
count t prince v and others then he bursts into one of his wild
furies and rages at everyone and everything seizes the letters opens
them and reads those from the emperor addressed to others ah so
thats the way they treat me no confidence in me ah ordered to keep
an eye on me very well then get along with you so he writes the
famous order of the day to general bennigsen

i am wounded and cannot ride and consequently cannot command the army
you have brought your army corps to pultusk routed here it is exposed
and without fuel or forage so something must be done and as you
yourself reported to count buxhowden yesterday you must think of
retreating to our frontierwhich do today

from all my riding he writes to the emperor i have got a saddle
sore which coming after all my previous journeys quite prevents my
riding and commanding so vast an army so i have passed on the command
to the general next in seniority count buxhowden having sent him my
whole staff and all that belongs to it advising him if there is a lack
of bread to move farther into the interior of prussia for only one
days ration of bread remains and in some regiments none at all as
reported by the division commanders ostermann and sedmoretzki and all
that the peasants had has been eaten up i myself will remain in
hospital at ostrolenka till i recover in regard to which i humbly
submit my report with the information that if the army remains in its
present bivouac another fortnight there will not be a healthy man left
in it by spring

grant leave to retire to his country seat to an old man who is already
in any case dishonored by being unable to fulfill the great and glorious
task for which he was chosen i shall await your most gracious
permission here in hospital that i may not have to play the part of a
secretary rather than commander in the army my removal from the army
does not produce the slightest stira blind man has left it there are
thousands such as i in russia

the field marshal is angry with the emperor and he punishes us all
isnt it logical

this is the first act those that follow are naturally increasingly
interesting and entertaining after the field marshals departure it
appears that we are within sight of the enemy and must give battle
buxhowden is commanderinchief by seniority but general bennigsen does
not quite see it more particularly as it is he and his corps who are
within sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by the opportunity to
fight a battle on his own hand as the germans say he does so this is
the battle of pultusk which is considered a great victory but in my
opinion was nothing of the kind we civilians as you know have a very
bad way of deciding whether a battle was won or lost those who retreat
after a battle have lost it is what we say and according to that it is
we who lost the battle of pultusk in short we retreat after the battle
but send a courier to petersburg with news of a victory and general
bennigsen hoping to receive from petersburg the post of commander in
chief as a reward for his victory does not give up the command of the
army to general buxhowden during this interregnum we begin a very
original and interesting series of maneuvers our aim is no longer as
it should be to avoid or attack the enemy but solely to avoid general
buxhowden who by right of seniority should be our chief so
energetically do we pursue this aim that after crossing an unfordable
river we burn the bridges to separate ourselves from our enemy who at
the moment is not bonaparte but buxhowden general buxhowden was all but
attacked and captured by a superior enemy force as a result of one of
these maneuvers that enabled us to escape him buxhowden pursues uswe
scuttle he hardly crosses the river to our side before we recross to
the other at last our enemy buxhowden catches us and attacks both
generals are angry and the result is a challenge on buxhowdens part
and an epileptic fit on bennigsens but at the critical moment the
courier who carried the news of our victory at pultusk to petersburg
returns bringing our appointment as commanderinchief and our first
foe buxhowden is vanquished we can now turn our thoughts to the
second bonaparte but as it turns out just at that moment a third
enemy rises before usnamely the orthodox russian soldiers loudly
demanding bread meat biscuits fodder and whatnot the stores are
empty the roads impassable the orthodox begin looting and in a way of
which our last campaign can give you no idea half the regiments form
bands and scour the countryside and put everything to fire and sword
the inhabitants are totally ruined the hospitals overflow with sick
and famine is everywhere twice the marauders even attack our
headquarters and the commanderinchief has to ask for a battalion to
disperse them during one of these attacks they carried off my empty
portmanteau and my dressing gown the emperor proposes to give all
commanders of divisions the right to shoot marauders but i much fear
this will oblige one half the army to shoot the other

at first prince andrew read with his eyes only but after a while in
spite of himself although he knew how far it was safe to trust
bilibin what he had read began to interest him more and more when he
had read thus far he crumpled the letter up and threw it away it was
not what he had read that vexed him but the fact that the life out
there in which he had now no part could perturb him he shut his eyes
rubbed his forehead as if to rid himself of all interest in what he had
read and listened to what was passing in the nursery suddenly he
thought he heard a strange noise through the door he was seized with
alarm lest something should have happened to the child while he was
reading the letter he went on tiptoe to the nursery door and opened it

just as he went in he saw that the nurse was hiding something from him
with a scared look and that princess mary was no longer by the cot

my dear he heard what seemed to him her despairing whisper behind
him

as often happens after long sleeplessness and long anxiety he was
seized by an unreasoning panicit occurred to him that the child was
dead all that he saw and heard seemed to confirm this terror

all is over he thought and a cold sweat broke out on his forehead
he went to the cot in confusion sure that he would find it empty and
that the nurse had been hiding the dead baby he drew the curtain aside
and for some time his frightened restless eyes could not find the baby
at last he saw him the rosy boy had tossed about till he lay across the
bed with his head lower than the pillow and was smacking his lips in
his sleep and breathing evenly

prince andrew was as glad to find the boy like that as if he had
already lost him he bent over him and as his sister had taught him
tried with his lips whether the child was still feverish the soft
forehead was moist prince andrew touched the head with his hand even
the hair was wet so profusely had the child perspired he was not dead
but evidently the crisis was over and he was convalescent prince andrew
longed to snatch up to squeeze to hold to his heart this helpless
little creature but dared not do so he stood over him gazing at his
head and at the little arms and legs which showed under the blanket he
heard a rustle behind him and a shadow appeared under the curtain of the
cot he did not look round but still gazing at the infants face
listened to his regular breathing the dark shadow was princess mary
who had come up to the cot with noiseless steps lifted the curtain and
dropped it again behind her prince andrew recognized her without
looking and held out his hand to her she pressed it

he has perspired said prince andrew

i was coming to tell you so

the child moved slightly in his sleep smiled and rubbed his forehead
against the pillow

prince andrew looked at his sister in the dim shadow of the curtain her
luminous eyes shone more brightly than usual from the tears of joy that
were in them she leaned over to her brother and kissed him slightly
catching the curtain of the cot each made the other a warning gesture
and stood still in the dim light beneath the curtain as if not wishing
to leave that seclusion where they three were shut off from all the
world prince andrew was the first to move away ruffling his hair
against the muslin of the curtain

yes this is the one thing left me now he said with a sigh





chapter x

soon after his admission to the masonic brotherhood pierre went to the
kiev province where he had the greatest number of serfs taking with
him full directions which he had written down for his own guidance as to
what he should do on his estates

when he reached kiev he sent for all his stewards to the head office and
explained to them his intentions and wishes he told them that steps
would be taken immediately to free his serfsand that till then they
were not to be overburdened with labor women while nursing their babies
were not to be sent to work assistance was to be given to the serfs
punishments were to be admonitory and not corporal and hospitals
asylums and schools were to be established on all the estates some of
the stewards there were semiliterate foremen among them listened with
alarm supposing these words to mean that the young count was displeased
with their management and embezzlement of money some after their first
fright were amused by pierres lisp and the new words they had not heard
before others simply enjoyed hearing how the master talked while the
cleverest among them including the chief steward understood from this
speech how they could best handle the master for their own ends

the chief steward expressed great sympathy with pierres intentions but
remarked that besides these changes it would be necessary to go into the
general state of affairs which was far from satisfactory

despite count bezúkhovs enormous wealth since he had come into an
income which was said to amount to five hundred thousand rubles a year
pierre felt himself far poorer than when his father had made him an
allowance of ten thousand rubles he had a dim perception of the
following budget

about  went in payments on all the estates to the land bank about
 went for the upkeep of the estate near moscow the town house
and the allowance to the three princesses about  was given in
pensions and the same amount for asylums  alimony was sent to
the countess about  went for interest on debts the building of a
new church previously begun had cost about  in each of the last
two years and he did not know how the rest about  rubles was
spent and almost every year he was obliged to borrow besides this the
chief steward wrote every year telling him of fires and bad harvests or
of the necessity of rebuilding factories and workshops so the first
task pierre had to face was one for which he had very little aptitude or
inclinationpractical business

he discussed estate affairs every day with his chief steward but he
felt that this did not forward matters at all he felt that these
consultations were detached from real affairs and did not link up with
them or make them move on the one hand the chief steward put the state
of things to him in the very worst light pointing out the necessity of
paying off the debts and undertaking new activities with serf labor to
which pierre did not agree on the other hand pierre demanded that
steps should be taken to liberate the serfs which the steward met by
showing the necessity of first paying off the loans from the land bank
and the consequent impossibility of a speedy emancipation

the steward did not say it was quite impossible but suggested selling
the forests in the province of kostroma the land lower down the river
and the crimean estate in order to make it possible all of which
operations according to him were connected with such complicated
measuresthe removal of injunctions petitions permits and so onthat
pierre became quite bewildered and only replied

yes yes do so

pierre had none of the practical persistence that would have enabled him
to attend to the business himself and so he disliked it and only tried
to pretend to the steward that he was attending to it the steward for
his part tried to pretend to the count that he considered these
consultations very valuable for the proprietor and troublesome to
himself

in kiev pierre found some people he knew and strangers hastened to make
his acquaintance and joyfully welcomed the rich newcomer the largest
landowner of the province temptations to pierres greatest weaknessthe
one to which he had confessed when admitted to the lodgewere so strong
that he could not resist them again whole days weeks and months of
his life passed in as great a rush and were as much occupied with
evening parties dinners lunches and balls giving him no time for
reflection as in petersburg instead of the new life he had hoped to
lead he still lived the old life only in new surroundings

of the three precepts of freemasonry pierre realized that he did not
fulfill the one which enjoined every mason to set an example of moral
life and that of the seven virtues he lacked twomorality and the love
of death he consoled himself with the thought that he fulfilled another
of the preceptsthat of reforming the human raceand had other
virtueslove of his neighbor and especially generosity

in the spring of  he decided to return to petersburg on the way he
intended to visit all his estates and see for himself how far his orders
had been carried out and in what state were the serfs whom god had
entrusted to his care and whom he intended to benefit

the chief steward who considered the young counts attempts almost
insaneunprofitable to himself to the count and to the serfsmade some
concessions continuing to represent the liberation of the serfs as
impracticable he arranged for the erection of large buildingsschools
hospitals and asylumson all the estates before the master arrived
everywhere preparations were made not for ceremonious welcomes which he
knew pierre would not like but for just such gratefully religious
ones with offerings of icons and the bread and salt of hospitality as
according to his understanding of his master would touch and delude
him

the southern spring the comfortable rapid traveling in a vienna
carriage and the solitude of the road all had a gladdening effect on
pierre the estates he had not before visited were each more picturesque
than the other the serfs everywhere seemed thriving and touchingly
grateful for the benefits conferred on them everywhere were receptions
which though they embarrassed pierre awakened a joyful feeling in the
depth of his heart in one place the peasants presented him with bread
and salt and an icon of saint peter and saint paul asking permission
as a mark of their gratitude for the benefits he had conferred on them
to build a new chantry to the church at their own expense in honor of
peter and paul his patron saints in another place the women with
infants in arms met him to thank him for releasing them from hard work
on a third estate the priest bearing a cross came to meet him
surrounded by children whom by the counts generosity he was
instructing in reading writing and religion on all his estates pierre
saw with his own eyes brick buildings erected or in course of erection
all on one plan for hospitals schools and almshouses which were soon
to be opened everywhere he saw the stewards accounts according to
which the serfs manorial labor had been diminished and heard the
touching thanks of deputations of serfs in their fullskirted blue
coats

what pierre did not know was that the place where they presented him
with bread and salt and wished to build a chantry in honor of peter and
paul was a market village where a fair was held on st peters day and
that the richest peasants who formed the deputation had begun the
chantry long before but that nine tenths of the peasants in that
villages were in a state of the greatest poverty he did not know that
since the nursing mothers were no longer sent to work on his land they
did still harder work on their own land he did not know that the priest
who met him with the cross oppressed the peasants by his exactions and
that the pupils parents wept at having to let him take their children
and secured their release by heavy payments he did not know that the
brick buildings built to plan were being built by serfs whose manorial
labor was thus increased though lessened on paper he did not know that
where the steward had shown him in the accounts that the serfs payments
had been diminished by a third their obligatory manorial work had been
increased by a half and so pierre was delighted with his visit to his
estates and quite recovered the philanthropic mood in which he had left
petersburg and wrote enthusiastic letters to his brotherinstructor
as he called the grand master

how easy it is how little effort it needs to do so much good
thought pierre and how little attention we pay to it

he was pleased at the gratitude he received but felt abashed at
receiving it this gratitude reminded him of how much more he might do
for these simple kindly people

the chief steward a very stupid but cunning man who saw perfectly
through the naïve and intelligent count and played with him as with a
toy seeing the effect these prearranged receptions had on pierre
pressed him still harder with proofs of the impossibility and above all
the uselessness of freeing the serfs who were quite happy as it was

pierre in his secret soul agreed with the steward that it would be
difficult to imagine happier people and that god only knew what would
happen to them when they were free but he insisted though reluctantly
on what he thought right the steward promised to do all in his power to
carry out the counts wishes seeing clearly that not only would the
count never be able to find out whether all measures had been taken for
the sale of the land and forests and to release them from the land bank
but would probably never even inquire and would never know that the
newly erected buildings were standing empty and that the serfs continued
to give in money and work all that other peoples serfs gavethat is to
say all that could be got out of them





chapter xi

returning from his journey through south russia in the happiest state of
mind pierre carried out an intention he had long had of visiting his
friend bolkónski whom he had not seen for two years

bogucharovo lay in a flat uninteresting part of the country among fields
and forests of fir and birch which were partly cut down the house lay
behind a newly dug pond filled with water to the brink and with banks
still bare of grass it was at the end of a village that stretched along
the highroad in the midst of a young copse in which were a few fir
trees

the homestead consisted of a threshing floor outhouses stables a
bathhouse a lodge and a large brick house with semicircular facade
still in course of construction round the house was a garden newly laid
out the fences and gates were new and solid two fire pumps and a water
cart painted green stood in a shed the paths were straight the
bridges were strong and had handrails everything bore an impress of
tidiness and good management some domestic serfs pierre met in reply
to inquiries as to where the prince lived pointed out a small newly
built lodge close to the pond anton a man who had looked after prince
andrew in his boyhood helped pierre out of his carriage said that the
prince was at home and showed him into a clean little anteroom

pierre was struck by the modesty of the small though clean house after
the brilliant surroundings in which he had last met his friend in
petersburg

he quickly entered the small reception room with its stillunplastered
wooden walls redolent of pine and would have gone farther but anton
ran ahead on tiptoe and knocked at a door

well what is it came a sharp unpleasant voice

a visitor answered anton

ask him to wait and the sound was heard of a chair being pushed back

pierre went with rapid steps to the door and suddenly came face to face
with prince andrew who came out frowning and looking old pierre
embraced him and lifting his spectacles kissed his friend on the cheek
and looked at him closely

well i did not expect you i am very glad said prince andrew

pierre said nothing he looked fixedly at his friend with surprise he
was struck by the change in him his words were kindly and there was a
smile on his lips and face but his eyes were dull and lifeless and in
spite of his evident wish to do so he could not give them a joyous and
glad sparkle prince andrew had grown thinner paler and more manly
looking but what amazed and estranged pierre till he got used to it
were his inertia and a wrinkle on his brow indicating prolonged
concentration on some one thought

as is usually the case with people meeting after a prolonged separation
it was long before their conversation could settle on anything they put
questions and gave brief replies about things they knew ought to be
talked over at length at last the conversation gradually settled on
some of the topics at first lightly touched on their past life plans
for the future pierres journeys and occupations the war and so on
the preoccupation and despondency which pierre had noticed in his
friends look was now still more clearly expressed in the smile with
which he listened to pierre especially when he spoke with joyful
animation of the past or the future it was as if prince andrew would
have liked to sympathize with what pierre was saying but could not the
latter began to feel that it was in bad taste to speak of his
enthusiasms dreams and hopes of happiness or goodness in prince
andrews presence he was ashamed to express his new masonic views
which had been particularly revived and strengthened by his late tour
he checked himself fearing to seem naïve yet he felt an irresistible
desire to show his friend as soon as possible that he was now a quite
different and better pierre than he had been in petersburg

i cant tell you how much i have lived through since then i hardly
know myself again

yes we have altered much very much since then said prince andrew

well and you what are your plans

plans repeated prince andrew ironically my plans he said as if
astonished at the word well you see im building i mean to settle
here altogether next year

pierre looked silently and searchingly into prince andrews face which
had grown much older

no i meant to ask pierre began but prince andrew interrupted him

but why talk of me talk to me yes tell me about your travels and
all you have been doing on your estates

pierre began describing what he had done on his estates trying as far
as possible to conceal his own part in the improvements that had been
made prince andrew several times prompted pierres story of what he had
been doing as though it were all an oldtime story and he listened not
only without interest but even as if ashamed of what pierre was telling
him

pierre felt uncomfortable and even depressed in his friends company and
at last became silent

ill tell you what my dear fellow said prince andrew who evidently
also felt depressed and constrained with his visitor i am only
bivouacking here and have just come to look round i am going back to my
sister today i will introduce you to her but of course you know her
already he said evidently trying to entertain a visitor with whom he
now found nothing in common we will go after dinner and would you now
like to look round my place

they went out and walked about till dinnertime talking of the political
news and common acquaintances like people who do not know each other
intimately prince andrew spoke with some animation and interest only of
the new homestead he was constructing and its buildings but even here
while on the scaffolding in the midst of a talk explaining the future
arrangements of the house he interrupted himself

however this is not at all interesting let us have dinner and then
well set off

at dinner conversation turned on pierres marriage

i was very much surprised when i heard of it said prince andrew

pierre blushed as he always did when it was mentioned and said
hurriedly i will tell you some time how it all happened but you know
it is all over and forever

forever said prince andrew nothings forever

but you know how it all ended dont you you heard of the duel

and so you had to go through that too

one thing i thank god for is that i did not kill that man said
pierre

why so asked prince andrew to kill a vicious dog is a very good
thing really

no to kill a man is badwrong

why is it wrong urged prince andrew it is not given to man to know
what is right and what is wrong men always did and always will err and
in nothing more than in what they consider right and wrong

what does harm to another is wrong said pierre feeling with pleasure
that for the first time since his arrival prince andrew was roused had
begun to talk and wanted to express what had brought him to his present
state

and who has told you what is bad for another man he asked

bad bad exclaimed pierre we all know what is bad for ourselves

yes we know that but the harm i am conscious of in myself is
something i cannot inflict on others said prince andrew growing more
and more animated and evidently wishing to express his new outlook to
pierre he spoke in french i only know two very real evils in life
remorse and illness the only good is the absence of those evils to
live for myself avoiding those two evils is my whole philosophy now

and love of ones neighbor and selfsacrifice began pierre no i
cant agree with you to live only so as not to do evil and not to have
to repent is not enough i lived like that i lived for myself and
ruined my life and only now when i am living or at least trying
pierres modesty made him correct himself to live for others only
now have i understood all the happiness of life no i shall not agree
with you and you do not really believe what you are saying prince
andrew looked silently at pierre with an ironic smile

when you see my sister princess mary youll get on with her he
said perhaps you are right for yourself he added after a short
pause but everyone lives in his own way you lived for yourself and
say you nearly ruined your life and only found happiness when you began
living for others i experienced just the reverse i lived for
gloryand after all what is glory the same love of others a desire to
do something for them a desire for their approvalso i lived for
others and not almost but quite ruined my life and i have become
calmer since i began to live only for myself

but what do you mean by living only for yourself asked pierre
growing excited what about your son your sister and your father

but thats just the same as myselfthey are not others explained
prince andrew the others ones neighbors le prochain as you and
princess mary call it are the chief source of all error and evil le
prochainyour kiev peasants to whom you want to do good

and he looked at pierre with a mocking challenging expression he
evidently wished to draw him on

you are joking replied pierre growing more and more excited what
error or evil can there be in my wishing to do good and even doing a
littlethough i did very little and did it very badly what evil can
there be in it if unfortunate people our serfs people like ourselves
were growing up and dying with no idea of god and truth beyond
ceremonies and meaningless prayers and are now instructed in a
comforting belief in future life retribution recompense and
consolation what evil and error are there in it if people were dying
of disease without help while material assistance could so easily be
rendered and i supplied them with a doctor a hospital and an asylum
for the aged and is it not a palpable unquestionable good if a
peasant or a woman with a baby has no rest day or night and i give
them rest and leisure said pierre hurrying and lisping and i have
done that though badly and to a small extent but i have done something
toward it and you cannot persuade me that it was not a good action and
more than that you cant make me believe that you do not think so
yourself and the main thing is he continued that i know and know
for certain that the enjoyment of doing this good is the only sure
happiness in life

yes if you put it like that its quite a different matter said
prince andrew i build a house and lay out a garden and you build
hospitals the one and the other may serve as a pastime but whats
right and whats good must be judged by one who knows all but not by
us well you want an argument he added come on then

they rose from the table and sat down in the entrance porch which served
as a veranda

come lets argue then said prince andrew you talk of schools he
went on crooking a finger education and so forth that is you want
to raise him pointing to a peasant who passed by them taking off his
cap from his animal condition and awaken in him spiritual needs while
it seems to me that animal happiness is the only happiness possible and
that is just what you want to deprive him of i envy him but you want
to make him what i am without giving him my means then you say
lighten his toil but as i see it physical labor is as essential to
him as much a condition of his existence as mental activity is to you
or me you cant help thinking i go to bed after two in the morning
thoughts come and i cant sleep but toss about till dawn because i
think and cant help thinking just as he cant help plowing and mowing
if he didnt he would go to the drink shop or fall ill just as i could
not stand his terrible physical labor but should die of it in a week so
he could not stand my physical idleness but would grow fat and die the
third thingwhat else was it you talked about and prince andrew
crooked a third finger ah yes hospitals medicine he has a fit he
is dying and you come and bleed him and patch him up he will drag
about as a cripple a burden to everybody for another ten years it
would be far easier and simpler for him to die others are being born
and there are plenty of them as it is it would be different if you
grudged losing a laborerthats how i regard himbut you want to cure
him from love of him and he does not want that and besides what a
notion that medicine ever cured anyone killed them yes said he
frowning angrily and turning away from pierre

prince andrew expressed his ideas so clearly and distinctly that it was
evident he had reflected on this subject more than once and he spoke
readily and rapidly like a man who has not talked for a long time his
glance became more animated as his conclusions became more hopeless

oh that is dreadful dreadful said pierre i dont understand how
one can live with such ideas i had such moments myself not long ago in
moscow and when traveling but at such times i collapsed so that i dont
live at alleverything seems hateful to me myself most of all then i
dont eat dont wash and how is it with you

why not wash that is not cleanly said prince andrew on the
contrary one must try to make ones life as pleasant as possible im
alive that is not my fault so i must live out my life as best i can
without hurting others

but with such ideas what motive have you for living one would sit
without moving undertaking nothing

life as it is leaves one no peace i should be thankful to do nothing
but here on the one hand the local nobility have done me the honor to
choose me to be their marshal it was all i could do to get out of it
they could not understand that i have not the necessary qualifications
for itthe kind of goodnatured fussy shallowness necessary for the
position then theres this house which must be built in order to have
a nook of ones own in which to be quiet and now theres this
recruiting

why arent you serving in the army

after austerlitz said prince andrew gloomily no thank you very
much i have promised myself not to serve again in the active russian
army and i wontnot even if bonaparte were here at smolensk
threatening bald hillseven then i wouldnt serve in the russian army
well as i was saying he continued recovering his composure now
theres this recruiting my father is chief in command of the third
district and my only way of avoiding active service is to serve under
him

then you are serving

i am

he paused a little while

and why do you serve

why for this reason my father is one of the most remarkable men of
his time but he is growing old and though not exactly cruel he has too
energetic a character he is so accustomed to unlimited power that he is
terrible and now he has this authority of a commanderinchief of the
recruiting granted by the emperor if i had been two hours late a
fortnight ago he would have had a paymasters clerk at yukhnovna
hanged said prince andrew with a smile so i am serving because i
alone have any influence with my father and now and then can save him
from actions which would torment him afterwards

well there you see

yes but it is not as you imagine prince andrew continued i did
not and do not in the least care about that scoundrel of a clerk who
had stolen some boots from the recruits i should even have been very
glad to see him hanged but i was sorry for my fatherthat again is for
myself

prince andrew grew more and more animated his eyes glittered feverishly
while he tried to prove to pierre that in his actions there was no
desire to do good to his neighbor

there now you wish to liberate your serfs he continued that is a
very good thing but not for youi dont suppose you ever had anyone
flogged or sent to siberiaand still less for your serfs if they are
beaten flogged or sent to siberia i dont suppose they are any the
worse off in siberia they lead the same animal life and the stripes on
their bodies heal and they are happy as before but it is a good thing
for proprietors who perish morally bring remorse upon themselves
stifle this remorse and grow callous as a result of being able to
inflict punishments justly and unjustly it is those people i pity and
for their sake i should like to liberate the serfs you may not have
seen but i have seen how good men brought up in those traditions of
unlimited power in time when they grow more irritable become cruel and
harsh are conscious of it but cannot restrain themselves and grow more
and more miserable

prince andrew spoke so earnestly that pierre could not help thinking
that these thoughts had been suggested to prince andrew by his fathers
case

he did not reply

so thats what im sorry forhuman dignity peace of mind purity and
not the serfs backs and foreheads which beat and shave as you may
always remain the same backs and foreheads

no no a thousand times no i shall never agree with you said
pierre





chapter xii

in the evening andrew and pierre got into the open carriage and drove to
bald hills prince andrew glancing at pierre broke the silence now and
then with remarks which showed that he was in a good temper

pointing to the fields he spoke of the improvements he was making in
his husbandry

pierre remained gloomily silent answering in monosyllables and
apparently immersed in his own thoughts

he was thinking that prince andrew was unhappy had gone astray did not
see the true light and that he pierre ought to aid enlighten and
raise him but as soon as he thought of what he should say he felt that
prince andrew with one word one argument would upset all his teaching
and he shrank from beginning afraid of exposing to possible ridicule
what to him was precious and sacred

no but why do you think so pierre suddenly began lowering his head
and looking like a bull about to charge why do you think so you
should not think so

think what about asked prince andrew with surprise

about life about mans destiny it cant be so i myself thought like
that and do you know what saved me freemasonry no dont smile
freemasonry is not a religious ceremonial sect as i thought it was
freemasonry is the best expression of the best the eternal aspects of
humanity

and he began to explain freemasonry as he understood it to prince
andrew he said that freemasonry is the teaching of christianity freed
from the bonds of state and church a teaching of equality brotherhood
and love

only our holy brotherhood has the real meaning of life all the rest is
a dream said pierre understand my dear fellow that outside this
union all is filled with deceit and falsehood and i agree with you that
nothing is left for an intelligent and good man but to live out his
life like you merely trying not to harm others but make our
fundamental convictions your own join our brotherhood give yourself up
to us let yourself be guided and you will at once feel yourself as i
have felt myself a part of that vast invisible chain the beginning of
which is hidden in heaven said pierre

prince andrew looking straight in front of him listened in silence to
pierres words more than once when the noise of the wheels prevented
his catching what pierre said he asked him to repeat it and by the
peculiar glow that came into prince andrews eyes and by his silence
pierre saw that his words were not in vain and that prince andrew would
not interrupt him or laugh at what he said

they reached a river that had overflowed its banks and which they had to
cross by ferry while the carriage and horses were being placed on it
they also stepped on the raft

prince andrew leaning his arms on the raft railing gazed silently at
the flooding waters glittering in the setting sun

well what do you think about it pierre asked why are you silent

what do i think about it i am listening to you its all very well
you say join our brotherhood and we will show you the aim of life the
destiny of man and the laws which govern the world but who are we
men how is it you know everything why do i alone not see what you see
you see a reign of goodness and truth on earth but i dont see it

pierre interrupted him

do you believe in a future life he asked

a future life prince andrew repeated but pierre giving him no time
to reply took the repetition for a denial the more readily as he knew
prince andrews former atheistic convictions

you say you cant see a reign of goodness and truth on earth nor could
i and it cannot be seen if one looks on our life here as the end of
everything on earth here on this earth pierre pointed to the
fields there is no truth all is false and evil but in the universe
in the whole universe there is a kingdom of truth and we who are now
the children of earth areeternallychildren of the whole universe
dont i feel in my soul that i am part of this vast harmonious whole
dont i feel that i form one link one step between the lower and
higher beings in this vast harmonious multitude of beings in whom the
deitythe supreme power if you prefer the termis manifest if i see
clearly see that ladder leading from plant to man why should i suppose
it breaks off at me and does not go farther and farther i feel that i
cannot vanish since nothing vanishes in this world but that i shall
always exist and always have existed i feel that beyond me and above me
there are spirits and that in this world there is truth

yes that is herders theory said prince andrew but it is not that
which can convince me dear friendlife and death are what convince
what convinces is when one sees a being dear to one bound up with ones
own life before whom one was to blame and had hoped to make it right
prince andrews voice trembled and he turned away and suddenly that
being is seized with pain suffers and ceases to exist why it
cannot be that there is no answer and i believe there is thats
what convinces that is what has convinced me said prince andrew

yes yes of course said pierre isnt that what im saying

no all i say is that it is not argument that convinces me of the
necessity of a future life but this when you go hand in hand with
someone and all at once that person vanishes there into nowhere and
you yourself are left facing that abyss and look in and i have looked
in

well thats it then you know that there is a there and there is a
someone there is the future life the someone isgod

prince andrew did not reply the carriage and horses had long since been
taken off onto the farther bank and reharnessed the sun had sunk half
below the horizon and an evening frost was starring the puddles near the
ferry but pierre and andrew to the astonishment of the footmen
coachmen and ferrymen still stood on the raft and talked

if there is a god and future life there is truth and good and mans
highest happiness consists in striving to attain them we must live we
must love and we must believe that we live not only today on this scrap
of earth but have lived and shall live forever there in the whole
said pierre and he pointed to the sky

prince andrew stood leaning on the railing of the raft listening to
pierre and he gazed with his eyes fixed on the red reflection of the
sun gleaming on the blue waters there was perfect stillness pierre
became silent the raft had long since stopped and only the waves of the
current beat softly against it below prince andrew felt as if the sound
of the waves kept up a refrain to pierres words whispering

it is true believe it

he sighed and glanced with a radiant childlike tender look at
pierres face flushed and rapturous but yet shy before his superior
friend

yes if it only were so said prince andrew however it is time to
get on he added and stepping off the raft he looked up at the sky
to which pierre had pointed and for the first time since austerlitz saw
that high everlasting sky he had seen while lying on that battlefield
and something that had long been slumbering something that was best
within him suddenly awoke joyful and youthful in his soul it
vanished as soon as he returned to the customary conditions of his life
but he knew that this feeling which he did not know how to develop
existed within him his meeting with pierre formed an epoch in prince
andrews life though outwardly he continued to live in the same old
way inwardly he began a new life





chapter xiii

it was getting dusk when prince andrew and pierre drove up to the front
entrance of the house at bald hills as they approached the house
prince andrew with a smile drew pierres attention to a commotion going
on at the back porch a woman bent with age with a wallet on her back
and a short longhaired young man in a black garment had rushed back
to the gate on seeing the carriage driving up two women ran out after
them and all four looking round at the carriage ran in dismay up the
steps of the back porch

those are marys gods folk said prince andrew they have mistaken
us for my father this is the one matter in which she disobeys him he
orders these pilgrims to be driven away but she receives them

but what are gods folk asked pierre

prince andrew had no time to answer the servants came out to meet them
and he asked where the old prince was and whether he was expected back
soon

the old prince had gone to the town and was expected back any minute

prince andrew led pierre to his own apartments which were always kept
in perfect order and readiness for him in his fathers house he himself
went to the nursery

let us go and see my sister he said to pierre when he returned i
have not found her yet she is hiding now sitting with her gods
folk it will serve her right she will be confused but you will see
her gods folk its really very curious

what are gods folk asked pierre

come and youll see for yourself

princess mary really was disconcerted and red patches came on her face
when they went in in her snug room with lamps burning before the icon
stand a young lad with a long nose and long hair wearing a monks
cassock sat on the sofa beside her behind a samovar near them in an
armchair sat a thin shriveled old woman with a meek expression on
her childlike face

andrew why didnt you warn me said the princess with mild reproach
as she stood before her pilgrims like a hen before her chickens

charmee de vous voir je suis tres contente de vous voir  she said
to pierre as he kissed her hand she had known him as a child and now
his friendship with andrew his misfortune with his wife and above all
his kindly simple face disposed her favorably toward him she looked at
him with her beautiful radiant eyes and seemed to say i like you very
much but please dont laugh at my people after exchanging the first
greetings they sat down

 delighted to see you i am very glad to see you

ah and ivanushka is here too said prince andrew glancing with a
smile at the young pilgrim

andrew said princess mary imploringly il faut que vous sachiez que
cest une femme  said prince andrew to pierre

andrew au nom de dieu  princess mary repeated

 you must know that this is a woman

  for heavens sake

it was evident that prince andrews ironical tone toward the pilgrims
and princess marys helpless attempts to protect them were their
customary longestablished relations on the matter

mais ma bonne amie said prince andrew vous devriez au contraire
mêtre reconnaissante de ce que jexplique a pierre votre intimité avec
ce jeune homme

 but my dear you ought on the contrary to be grateful to me for
explaining to pierre your intimacy with this young man

really said pierre gazing over his spectacles with curiosity and
seriousness for which princess mary was specially grateful to him into
ivanushkas face who seeing that she was being spoken about looked
round at them all with crafty eyes

princess marys embarrassment on her peoples account was quite
unnecessary they were not in the least abashed the old woman lowering
her eyes but casting side glances at the newcomers had turned her cup
upside down and placed a nibbled bit of sugar beside it and sat quietly
in her armchair though hoping to be offered another cup of tea
ivanushka sipping out of her saucer looked with sly womanish eyes from
under her brows at the young men

where have you been to kiev prince andrew asked the old woman

i have good sir she answered garrulously just at christmastime i
was deemed worthy to partake of the holy and heavenly sacrament at the
shrine of the saint and now im from kolyazin master where a great
and wonderful blessing has been revealed

and was ivanushka with you

i go by myself benefactor said ivanushka trying to speak in a bass
voice i only came across pelageya in yukhnovo

pelageya interrupted her companion she evidently wished to tell what
she had seen

in kolyazin master a wonderful blessing has been revealed

what is it some new relics asked prince andrew

andrew do leave off said princess mary dont tell him pelageya

no why not my dear why shouldnt i i like him he is kind he is
one of gods chosen hes a benefactor he once gave me ten rubles i
remember when i was in kiev crazy cyril says to me hes one of gods
own and goes barefoot summer and winter he says why are you not
going to the right place go to kolyazin where a wonderworking icon of
the holy mother of god has been revealed on hearing those words i said
goodby to the holy folk and went

all were silent only the pilgrim woman went on in measured tones
drawing in her breath

so i come master and the people say to me a great blessing has been
revealed holy oil trickles from the cheeks of our blessed mother the
holy virgin mother of god

all right all right you can tell us afterwards said princess mary
flushing

let me ask her said pierre did you see it yourselves he inquired

oh yes master i was found worthy such a brightness on the face like
the light of heaven and from the blessed mothers cheek it drops and
drops

but dear me that must be a fraud said pierre naïvely who had
listened attentively to the pilgrim

oh master what are you saying exclaimed the horrified pelageya
turning to princess mary for support

they impose on the people he repeated

lord jesus christ exclaimed the pilgrim woman crossing herself oh
dont speak so master there was a general who did not believe and
said the monks cheat and as soon as hed said it he went blind and
he dreamed that the holy virgin mother of the kiev catacombs came to him
and said believe in me and i will make you whole so he begged take
me to her take me to her its the real truth im telling you i saw
it myself so he was brought quite blind straight to her and he goes
up to her and falls down and says make me whole says he and ill
give thee what the tsar bestowed on me i saw it myself master the
star is fixed into the icon well and what do you think he received
his sight its a sin to speak so god will punish you she said
admonishingly turning to pierre

how did the star get into the icon pierre asked

and was the holy mother promoted to the rank of general said prince
andrew with a smile

pelageya suddenly grew quite pale and clasped her hands

oh master master what a sin and you who have a son she began her
pallor suddenly turning to a vivid red master what have you said god
forgive you and she crossed herself lord forgive him my dear what
does it mean she asked turning to princess mary she got up and
almost crying began to arrange her wallet she evidently felt
frightened and ashamed to have accepted charity in a house where such
things could be said and was at the same time sorry to have now to
forgo the charity of this house

now why need you do it said princess mary why did you come to
me

come pelageya i was joking said pierre princesse ma parole je
nai pas voulu loffenser  i did not mean anything i was only
joking he said smiling shyly and trying to efface his offense it
was all my fault and andrew was only joking

 princess on my word i did not wish to offend her

pelageya stopped doubtfully but in pierres face there was such a look
of sincere penitence and prince andrew glanced so meekly now at her and
now at pierre that she was gradually reassured





chapter xiv

the pilgrim woman was appeased and being encouraged to talk gave a
long account of father amphilochus who led so holy a life that his
hands smelled of incense and how on her last visit to kiev some monks
she knew let her have the keys of the catacombs and how she taking
some dried bread with her had spent two days in the catacombs with the
saints id pray awhile to one ponder awhile then go on to another
id sleep a bit and then again go and kiss the relics and there was
such peace all around such blessedness that one dont want to come
out even into the light of heaven again

pierre listened to her attentively and seriously prince andrew went out
of the room and then leaving gods folk to finish their tea
princess mary took pierre into the drawing room

you are very kind she said to him

oh i really did not mean to hurt her feelings i understand them so
well and have the greatest respect for them

princess mary looked at him silently and smiled affectionately

i have known you a long time you see and am as fond of you as of a
brother she said how do you find andrew she added hurriedly not
giving him time to reply to her affectionate words i am very anxious
about him his health was better in the winter but last spring his
wound reopened and the doctor said he ought to go away for a cure and i
am also very much afraid for him spiritually he has not a character
like us women who when we suffer can weep away our sorrows he keeps
it all within him today he is cheerful and in good spirits but that is
the effect of your visithe is not often like that if you could
persuade him to go abroad he needs activity and this quiet regular
life is very bad for him others dont notice it but i see it

toward ten oclock the men servants rushed to the front door hearing
the bells of the old princes carriage approaching prince andrew and
pierre also went out into the porch

whos that asked the old prince noticing pierre as he got out of the
carriage

ah very glad kiss me he said having learned who the young stranger
was

the old prince was in a good temper and very gracious to pierre

before supper prince andrew coming back to his fathers study found
him disputing hotly with his visitor pierre was maintaining that a time
would come when there would be no more wars the old prince disputed it
chaffingly but without getting angry

drain the blood from mens veins and put in water instead then there
will be no more war old womens nonsenseold womens nonsense he
repeated but still he patted pierre affectionately on the shoulder and
then went up to the table where prince andrew evidently not wishing to
join in the conversation was looking over the papers his father had
brought from town the old prince went up to him and began to talk
business

the marshal a count rostóv hasnt sent half his contingent he came
to town and wanted to invite me to dinneri gave him a pretty dinner
and there look at this well my boy the old prince went on
addressing his son and patting pierre on the shoulder a fine
fellowyour friendi like him he stirs me up another says clever
things and one doesnt care to listen but this one talks rubbish yet
stirs an old fellow up well go get along perhaps ill come and sit
with you at supper well have another dispute make friends with my
little fool princess mary he shouted after pierre through the door

only now on his visit to bald hills did pierre fully realize the
strength and charm of his friendship with prince andrew that charm was
not expressed so much in his relations with him as with all his family
and with the household with the stern old prince and the gentle timid
princess mary though he had scarcely known them pierre at once felt
like an old friend they were all fond of him already not only princess
mary who had been won by his gentleness with the pilgrims gave him her
most radiant looks but even the oneyearold prince nicholas as his
grandfather called him smiled at pierre and let himself be taken in his
arms and michael ivánovich and mademoiselle bourienne looked at him
with pleasant smiles when he talked to the old prince

the old prince came in to supper this was evidently on pierres
account and during the two days of the young mans visit he was
extremely kind to him and told him to visit them again

when pierre had gone and the members of the household met together they
began to express their opinions of him as people always do after a new
acquaintance has left but as seldom happens no one said anything but
what was good of him





chapter xv

when returning from his leave rostóv felt for the first time how
close was the bond that united him to denisov and the whole regiment

on approaching it rostóv felt as he had done when approaching his home
in moscow when he saw the first hussar with the unbuttoned uniform of
his regiment when he recognized redhaired dementyev and saw the picket
ropes of the roan horses when lavrushka gleefully shouted to his
master the count has come and denisov who had been asleep on his
bed ran all disheveled out of the mud hut to embrace him and the
officers collected round to greet the new arrival rostóv experienced
the same feeling as when his mother his father and his sister had
embraced him and tears of joy choked him so that he could not speak
the regiment was also a home and as unalterably dear and precious as
his parents house

when he had reported himself to the commander of the regiment and had
been reassigned to his former squadron had been on duty and had gone
out foraging when he had again entered into all the little interests of
the regiment and felt himself deprived of liberty and bound in one
narrow unchanging frame he experienced the same sense of peace of
moral support and the same sense of being at home here in his own
place as he had felt under the parental roof but here was none of all
that turmoil of the world at large where he did not know his right
place and took mistaken decisions here was no sónya with whom he ought
or ought not to have an explanation here was no possibility of going
there or not going there here there were not twentyfour hours in the
day which could be spent in such a variety of ways there was not that
innumerable crowd of people of whom not one was nearer to him or farther
from him than another there were none of those uncertain and undefined
money relations with his father and nothing to recall that terrible
loss to dólokhov here in the regiment all was clear and simple the
whole world was divided into two unequal parts one our pávlograd
regiment the other all the rest and the rest was no concern of his
in the regiment everything was definite who was lieutenant who
captain who was a good fellow who a bad one and most of all who was
a comrade the canteenkeeper gave one credit ones pay came every four
months there was nothing to think out or decide you had only to do
nothing that was considered bad in the pávlograd regiment and when
given an order to do what was clearly distinctly and definitely
orderedand all would be well

having once more entered into the definite conditions of this regimental
life rostóv felt the joy and relief a tired man feels on lying down to
rest life in the regiment during this campaign was all the pleasanter
for him because after his loss to dólokhov for which in spite of all
his familys efforts to console him he could not forgive himself he
had made up his mind to atone for his fault by serving not as he had
done before but really well and by being a perfectly firstrate
comrade and officerin a word a splendid man altogether a thing which
seemed so difficult out in the world but so possible in the regiment

after his losses he had determined to pay back his debt to his parents
in five years he received ten thousand rubles a year but now resolved
to take only two thousand and leave the rest to repay the debt to his
parents

our army after repeated retreats and advances and battles at pultusk
and preussischeylau was concentrated near bartenstein it was awaiting
the emperors arrival and the beginning of a new campaign

the pávlograd regiment belonging to that part of the army which had
served in the  campaign had been recruiting up to strength in
russia and arrived too late to take part in the first actions of the
campaign it had been neither at pultusk nor at preussischeylau and
when it joined the army in the field in the second half of the campaign
was attached to platovs division

platovs division was acting independently of the main army several
times parts of the pávlograd regiment had exchanged shots with the
enemy had taken prisoners and once had even captured marshal oudinots
carriages in april the pávlograds were stationed immovably for some
weeks near a totally ruined and deserted german village

a thaw had set in it was muddy and cold the ice on the river broke
and the roads became impassable for days neither provisions for the men
nor fodder for the horses had been issued as no transports could
arrive the men dispersed about the abandoned and deserted villages
searching for potatoes but found few even of these

everything had been eaten up and the inhabitants had all fledif any
remained they were worse than beggars and nothing more could be taken
from them even the soldiers usually pitiless enough instead of taking
anything from them often gave them the last of their rations

the pávlograd regiment had had only two men wounded in action but had
lost nearly half its men from hunger and sickness in the hospitals
death was so certain that soldiers suffering from fever or the swelling
that came from bad food preferred to remain on duty and hardly able to
drag their legs went to the front rather than to the hospitals when
spring came on the soldiers found a plant just showing out of the
ground that looked like asparagus which for some reason they called
mashkas sweet root it was very bitter but they wandered about the
fields seeking it and dug it out with their sabers and ate it though
they were ordered not to do so as it was a noxious plant that spring a
new disease broke out among the soldiers a swelling of the arms legs
and face which the doctors attributed to eating this root but in spite
of all this the soldiers of denisovs squadron fed chiefly on mashkas
sweet root because it was the second week that the last of the
biscuits were being doled out at the rate of half a pound a man and the
last potatoes received had sprouted and frozen

the horses also had been fed for a fortnight on straw from the thatched
roofs and had become terribly thin though still covered with tufts of
felty winter hair

despite this destitution the soldiers and officers went on living just
as usual despite their pale swollen faces and tattered uniforms the
hussars formed line for roll call kept things in order groomed their
horses polished their arms brought in straw from the thatched roofs in
place of fodder and sat down to dine round the caldrons from which they
rose up hungry joking about their nasty food and their hunger as
usual in their spare time they lit bonfires steamed themselves before
them naked smoked picked out and baked sprouting rotten potatoes told
and listened to stories of potëmkins and suvórovs campaigns or to
legends of alesha the sly or the priests laborer mikolka

the officers as usual lived in twos and threes in the roofless half
ruined houses the seniors tried to collect straw and potatoes and in
general food for the men the younger ones occupied themselves as
before some playing cards there was plenty of money though there was
no food some with more innocent games such as quoits and skittles
the general trend of the campaign was rarely spoken of partly because
nothing certain was known about it partly because there was a vague
feeling that in the main it was going badly

rostóv lived as before with denisov and since their furlough they had
become more friendly than ever denisov never spoke of rostóvs family
but by the tender friendship his commander showed him rostóv felt that
the elder hussars luckless love for natásha played a part in
strengthening their friendship denisov evidently tried to expose rostóv
to danger as seldom as possible and after an action greeted his safe
return with evident joy on one of his foraging expeditions in a
deserted and ruined village to which he had come in search of
provisions rostóv found a family consisting of an old pole and his
daughter with an infant in arms they were half clad hungry too weak
to get away on foot and had no means of obtaining a conveyance rostóv
brought them to his quarters placed them in his own lodging and kept
them for some weeks while the old man was recovering one of his
comrades talking of women began chaffing rostóv saying that he was
more wily than any of them and that it would not be a bad thing if he
introduced to them the pretty polish girl he had saved rostóv took the
joke as an insult flared up and said such unpleasant things to the
officer that it was all denisov could do to prevent a duel when the
officer had gone away denisov who did not himself know what rostóvs
relations with the polish girl might be began to upbraid him for his
quickness of temper and rostóv replied

say what you like she is like a sister to me and i cant tell you
how it offended me because well for that reason

denisov patted him on the shoulder and began rapidly pacing the room
without looking at rostóv as was his way at moments of deep feeling

ah what a mad bweed you wostovs are he muttered and rostóv noticed
tears in his eyes





chapter xvi

in april the troops were enlivened by news of the emperors arrival but
rostóv had no chance of being present at the review he held at
bartenstein as the pávlograds were at the outposts far beyond that
place

they were bivouacking denisov and rostóv were living in an earth hut
dug out for them by the soldiers and roofed with branches and turf the
hut was made in the following manner which had then come into vogue a
trench was dug three and a half feet wide four feet eight inches deep
and eight feet long at one end of the trench steps were cut out and
these formed the entrance and vestibule the trench itself was the room
in which the lucky ones such as the squadron commander had a board
lying on piles at the end opposite the entrance to serve as a table on
each side of the trench the earth was cut out to a breadth of about two
and a half feet and this did duty for bedsteads and couches the roof
was so constructed that one could stand up in the middle of the trench
and could even sit up on the beds if one drew close to the table
denisov who was living luxuriously because the soldiers of his squadron
liked him had also a board in the roof at the farther end with a piece
of broken but mended glass in it for a window when it was very cold
embers from the soldiers campfire were placed on a bent sheet of iron
on the steps in the reception roomas denisov called that part of the
hutand it was then so warm that the officers of whom there were always
some with denisov and rostóv sat in their shirt sleeves

in april rostóv was on orderly duty one morning between seven and
eight returning after a sleepless night he sent for embers changed
his rainsoaked underclothes said his prayers drank tea got warm
then tidied up the things on the table and in his own corner and his
face glowing from exposure to the wind and with nothing on but his
shirt lay down on his back putting his arms under his head he was
pleasantly considering the probability of being promoted in a few days
for his last reconnoitering expedition and was awaiting denisov who
had gone out somewhere and with whom he wanted a talk

suddenly he heard denisov shouting in a vibrating voice behind the hut
evidently much excited rostóv moved to the window to see whom he was
speaking to and saw the quartermaster topcheenko

i ordered you not to let them eat that mashka woot stuff denisov was
shouting and i saw with my own eyes how lazarchuk bwought some fwom
the fields

i have given the order again and again your honor but they dont
obey answered the quartermaster

rostóv lay down again on his bed and thought complacently let him fuss
and bustle now my jobs done and im lying downcapitally he could
hear that lavrushkathat sly bold orderly of denisovswas talking as
well as the quartermaster lavrushka was saying something about loaded
wagons biscuits and oxen he had seen when he had gone out for
provisions

then denisovs voice was heard shouting farther and farther away
saddle second platoon

where are they off to now thought rostóv

five minutes later denisov came into the hut climbed with muddy boots
on the bed lit his pipe furiously scattered his things about took his
leaded whip buckled on his saber and went out again in answer to
rostóvs inquiry where he was going he answered vaguely and crossly
that he had some business

let god and our gweat monarch judge me afterwards said denisov going
out and rostóv heard the hoofs of several horses splashing through the
mud he did not even trouble to find out where denisov had gone having
got warm in his corner he fell asleep and did not leave the hut till
toward evening denisov had not yet returned the weather had cleared
up and near the next hut two officers and a cadet were playing svayka
laughing as they threw their missiles which buried themselves in the
soft mud rostóv joined them in the middle of the game the officers
saw some wagons approaching with fifteen hussars on their skinny horses
behind them the wagons escorted by the hussars drew up to the picket
ropes and a crowd of hussars surrounded them

there now denisov has been worrying said rostóv and here are the
provisions

so they are said the officers wont the soldiers be glad

a little behind the hussars came denisov accompanied by two infantry
officers with whom he was talking

rostóv went to meet them

i warn you captain one of the officers a short thin man evidently
very angry was saying

havent i told you i wont give them up replied denisov

you will answer for it captain it is mutinyseizing the transport of
ones own army our men have had nothing to eat for two days

and mine have had nothing for two weeks said denisov

it is robbery youll answer for it sir said the infantry officer
raising his voice

now what are you pestewing me for cried denisov suddenly losing his
temper i shall answer for it and not you and youd better not buzz
about here till you get hurt be off go he shouted at the officers

very well then shouted the little officer undaunted and not riding
away if you are determined to rob ill

go to the devil quick mach while youre safe and sound and denisov
turned his horse on the officer

very well very well muttered the officer threateningly and turning
his horse he trotted away jolting in his saddle

a dog astwide a fence a weal dog astwide a fence shouted denisov
after him the most insulting expression a cavalryman can address to a
mounted infantryman and riding up to rostóv he burst out laughing

ive taken twansports from the infantwy by force he said after all
cant let our men starve

the wagons that had reached the hussars had been consigned to an
infantry regiment but learning from lavrushka that the transport was
unescorted denisov with his hussars had seized it by force the
soldiers had biscuits dealt out to them freely and they even shared
them with the other squadrons

the next day the regimental commander sent for denisov and holding his
fingers spread out before his eyes said

this is how i look at this affair i know nothing about it and wont
begin proceedings but i advise you to ride over to the staff and settle
the business there in the commissariat department and if possible sign a
receipt for such and such stores received if not as the demand was
booked against an infantry regiment there will be a row and the affair
may end badly

from the regimental commanders denisov rode straight to the staff with
a sincere desire to act on this advice in the evening he came back to
his dugout in a state such as rostóv had never yet seen him in denisov
could not speak and gasped for breath when rostóv asked what was the
matter he only uttered some incoherent oaths and threats in a hoarse
feeble voice

alarmed at denisovs condition rostóv suggested that he should undress
drink some water and send for the doctor

twy me for wobbewy oh some more water let them twy me but ill
always thwash scoundwels and ill tell the empewo ice he
muttered

the regimental doctor when he came said it was absolutely necessary to
bleed denisov a deep saucer of black blood was taken from his hairy arm
and only then was he able to relate what had happened to him

i get there began denisov now then wheres your chiefs
quarters they were pointed out please to wait ive widden twenty
miles and have duties to attend to and no time to wait announce me
vewy well so out comes their head chiefalso took it into his head to
lecture me its wobbewywobbewy i say is not done by man who
seizes pwovisions to feed his soldiers but by him who takes them to
fill his own pockets will you please be silent vewy good then he
says go and give a weceipt to the commissioner but your affair will
be passed on to headquarters i go to the commissioner i enter and at
the table who do you think no but wait a bit who is it thats
starving us shouted denisov hitting the table with the fist of his
newly bled arm so violently that the table nearly broke down and the
tumblers on it jumped about telyanin what so its you whos
starving us to death is it take this and this and i hit him so pat
stwaight on his snout ah what a what a and i stated
fwashing him well ive had a bit of fun i can tell you cried
denisov gleeful and yet angry his white teeth showing under his black
mustache id have killed him if they hadnt taken him away

but what are you shouting for calm yourself said rostóv youve set
your arm bleeding afresh wait we must tie it up again

denisov was bandaged up again and put to bed next day he woke calm and
cheerful

but at noon the adjutant of the regiment came into rostóvs and
denisovs dugout with a grave and serious face and regretfully showed
them a paper addressed to major denisov from the regimental commander in
which inquiries were made about yesterdays occurrence the adjutant
told them that the affair was likely to take a very bad turn that a
courtmartial had been appointed and that in view of the severity with
which marauding and insubordination were now regarded degradation to
the ranks would be the best that could be hoped for

the case as represented by the offended parties was that after
seizing the transports major denisov being drunk went to the chief
quartermaster and without any provocation called him a thief threatened
to strike him and on being led out had rushed into the office and given
two officials a thrashing and dislocated the arm of one of them

in answer to rostóvs renewed questions denisov said laughing that he
thought he remembered that some other fellow had got mixed up in it but
that it was all nonsense and rubbish and he did not in the least fear
any kind of trial and that if those scoundrels dared attack him he
would give them an answer that they would not easily forget

denisov spoke contemptuously of the whole matter but rostóv knew him
too well not to detect that while hiding it from others at heart he
feared a courtmartial and was worried over the affair which was
evidently taking a bad turn every day letters of inquiry and notices
from the court arrived and on the first of may denisov was ordered to
hand the squadron over to the next in seniority and appear before the
staff of his division to explain his violence at the commissariat
office on the previous day platov reconnoitered with two cossack
regiments and two squadrons of hussars denisov as was his wont rode
out in front of the outposts parading his courage a bullet fired by a
french sharpshooter hit him in the fleshy part of his leg perhaps at
another time denisov would not have left the regiment for so slight a
wound but now he took advantage of it to excuse himself from appearing
at the staff and went into hospital





chapter xvii

in june the battle of friedland was fought in which the pávlograds did
not take part and after that an armistice was proclaimed rostóv who
felt his friends absence very much having no news of him since he left
and feeling very anxious about his wound and the progress of his
affairs took advantage of the armistice to get leave to visit denisov
in hospital

the hospital was in a small prussian town that had been twice devastated
by russian and french troops because it was summer when it is so
beautiful out in the fields the little town presented a particularly
dismal appearance with its broken roofs and fences its foul streets
tattered inhabitants and the sick and drunken soldiers wandering about

the hospital was in a brick building with some of the window frames and
panes broken and a courtyard surrounded by the remains of a wooden fence
that had been pulled to pieces several bandaged soldiers with pale
swollen faces were sitting or walking about in the sunshine in the
yard

directly rostóv entered the door he was enveloped by a smell of
putrefaction and hospital air on the stairs he met a russian army
doctor smoking a cigar the doctor was followed by a russian assistant

i cant tear myself to pieces the doctor was saying come to makar
alexeevich in the evening i shall be there

the assistant asked some further questions

oh do the best you can isnt it all the same the doctor noticed
rostóv coming upstairs

what do you want sir said the doctor what do you want the bullets
having spared you do you want to try typhus this is a pesthouse sir

how so asked rostóv

typhus sir its death to go in only we two makeev and i he
pointed to the assistant keep on here some five of us doctors have
died in this place when a new one comes he is done for in a week
said the doctor with evident satisfaction prussian doctors have been
invited here but our allies dont like it at all

rostóv explained that he wanted to see major denisov of the hussars who
was wounded

i dont know i cant tell you sir only think i am alone in charge
of three hospitals with more than four hundred patients its well that
the charitable prussian ladies send us two pounds of coffee and some
lint each month or we should be lost he laughed four hundred sir
and theyre always sending me fresh ones there are four hundred eh
he asked turning to the assistant

the assistant looked fagged out he was evidently vexed and impatient
for the talkative doctor to go

major denisov rostóv said again he was wounded at molliten

dead i fancy eh makeev queried the doctor in a tone of
indifference

the assistant however did not confirm the doctors words

is he tall and with reddish hair asked the doctor

rostóv described denisovs appearance

there was one like that said the doctor as if pleased that one is
dead i fancy however ill look up our list we had a list have you
got it makeev

makar alexeevich has the list answered the assistant but if youll
step into the officers wards youll see for yourself he added
turning to rostóv

ah youd better not go sir said the doctor or you may have to
stay here yourself

but rostóv bowed himself away from the doctor and asked the assistant to
show him the way

only dont blame me the doctor shouted up after him

rostóv and the assistant went into the dark corridor the smell was so
strong there that rostóv held his nose and had to pause and collect his
strength before he could go on a door opened to the right and an
emaciated sallow man on crutches barefoot and in underclothing limped
out and leaning against the doorpost looked with glittering envious
eyes at those who were passing glancing in at the door rostóv saw that
the sick and wounded were lying on the floor on straw and overcoats

may i go in and look

what is there to see said the assistant

but just because the assistant evidently did not want him to go in
rostóv entered the soldiers ward the foul air to which he had already
begun to get used in the corridor was still stronger here it was a
little different more pungent and one felt that this was where it
originated

in the long room brightly lit up by the sun through the large windows
the sick and wounded lay in two rows with their heads to the walls and
leaving a passage in the middle most of them were unconscious and paid
no attention to the newcomers those who were conscious raised
themselves or lifted their thin yellow faces and all looked intently at
rostóv with the same expression of hope of relief reproach and envy
of anothers health rostóv went to the middle of the room and looking
through the open doors into the two adjoining rooms saw the same thing
there he stood still looking silently around he had not at all
expected such a sight just before him almost across the middle of the
passage on the bare floor lay a sick man probably a cossack to judge
by the cut of his hair the man lay on his back his huge arms and legs
outstretched his face was purple his eyes were rolled back so that
only the whites were seen and on his bare legs and arms which were
still red the veins stood out like cords he was knocking the back of
his head against the floor hoarsely uttering some word which he kept
repeating rostóv listened and made out the word it was drink drink
a drink rostóv glanced round looking for someone who would put this
man back in his place and bring him water

who looks after the sick here he asked the assistant

just then a commissariat soldier a hospital orderly came in from the
next room marching stiffly and drew up in front of rostóv

good day your honor he shouted rolling his eyes at rostóv and
evidently mistaking him for one of the hospital authorities

get him to his place and give him some water said rostóv pointing to
the cossack

yes your honor the soldier replied complacently and rolling his
eyes more than ever he drew himself up still straighter but did not
move

no its impossible to do anything here thought rostóv lowering his
eyes and he was going out but became aware of an intense look fixed on
him on his right and he turned close to the corner on an overcoat
sat an old unshaven graybearded soldier as thin as a skeleton with a
stern sallow face and eyes intently fixed on rostóv the mans neighbor
on one side whispered something to him pointing at rostóv who noticed
that the old man wanted to speak to him he drew nearer and saw that the
old man had only one leg bent under him the other had been amputated
above the knee his neighbor on the other side who lay motionless some
distance from him with his head thrown back was a young soldier with a
snub nose his pale waxen face was still freckled and his eyes were
rolled back rostóv looked at the young soldier and a cold chill ran
down his back

why this one seems he began turning to the assistant

and how weve been begging your honor said the old soldier his jaw
quivering hes been dead since morning after all were men not
dogs

ill send someone at once he shall be taken awaytaken away at once
said the assistant hurriedly let us go your honor

yes yes let us go said rostóv hastily and lowering his eyes and
shrinking he tried to pass unnoticed between the rows of reproachful
envious eyes that were fixed upon him and went out of the room





chapter xviii

going along the corridor the assistant led rostóv to the officers
wards consisting of three rooms the doors of which stood open there
were beds in these rooms and the sick and wounded officers were lying or
sitting on them some were walking about the rooms in hospital dressing
gowns the first person rostóv met in the officers ward was a thin
little man with one arm who was walking about the first room in a
nightcap and hospital dressing gown with a pipe between his teeth
rostóv looked at him trying to remember where he had seen him before

see where weve met again said the little man tushin tushin dont
you remember who gave you a lift at schon grabern and ive had a bit
cut off you see he went on with a smile pointing to the empty
sleeve of his dressing gown looking for vasíli dmítrich denisov my
neighbor he added when he heard who rostóv wanted here here and
tushin led him into the next room from whence came sounds of several
laughing voices

how can they laugh or even live at all here thought rostóv still
aware of that smell of decomposing flesh that had been so strong in the
soldiers ward and still seeming to see fixed on him those envious
looks which had followed him out from both sides and the face of that
young soldier with eyes rolled back

denisov lay asleep on his bed with his head under the blanket though it
was nearly noon

ah wostov how are you how are you he called out still in the same
voice as in the regiment but rostóv noticed sadly that under this
habitual ease and animation some new sinister hidden feeling showed
itself in the expression of denisovs face and the intonations of his
voice

his wound though a slight one had not yet healed even now six weeks
after he had been hit his face had the same swollen pallor as the faces
of the other hospital patients but it was not this that struck rostóv
what struck him was that denisov did not seem glad to see him and
smiled at him unnaturally he did not ask about the regiment nor about
the general state of affairs and when rostóv spoke of these matters did
not listen

rostóv even noticed that denisov did not like to be reminded of the
regiment or in general of that other free life which was going on
outside the hospital he seemed to try to forget that old life and was
only interested in the affair with the commissariat officers on
rostóvs inquiry as to how the matter stood he at once produced from
under his pillow a paper he had received from the commission and the
rough draft of his answer to it he became animated when he began
reading his paper and specially drew rostóvs attention to the stinging
rejoinders he made to his enemies his hospital companions who had
gathered round rostóva fresh arrival from the world outsidegradually
began to disperse as soon as denisov began reading his answer rostóv
noticed by their faces that all those gentlemen had already heard that
story more than once and were tired of it only the man who had the next
bed a stout uhlan continued to sit on his bed gloomily frowning and
smoking a pipe and little onearmed tushin still listened shaking his
head disapprovingly in the middle of the reading the uhlan interrupted
denisov

but what i say is he said turning to rostóv it would be best
simply to petition the emperor for pardon they say great rewards will
now be distributed and surely a pardon would be granted

me petition the empewo exclaimed denisov in a voice to which he
tried hard to give the old energy and fire but which sounded like an
expression of irritable impotence what for if i were a wobber i would
ask mercy but im being courtmartialed for bwinging wobbers to book
let them twy me im not afwaid of anyone ive served the tsar and my
countwy honowably and have not stolen and am i to be degwaded
listen im witing to them stwaight this is what i say if i had
wobbed the tweasuwy

its certainly well written said tushin but thats not the point
vasíli dmítrich and he also turned to rostóv one has to submit and
vasíli dmítrich doesnt want to you know the auditor told you it was a
bad business

well let it be bad said denisov

the auditor wrote out a petition for you continued tushin and you
ought to sign it and ask this gentleman to take it no doubt he
indicating rostóv has connections on the staff you wont find a
better opportunity

havent i said im not going to gwovel denisov interrupted him went
on reading his paper

rostóv had not the courage to persuade denisov though he instinctively
felt that the way advised by tushin and the other officers was the
safest and though he would have been glad to be of service to denisov
he knew his stubborn will and straightforward hasty temper

when the reading of denisovs virulent reply which took more than an
hour was over rostóv said nothing and he spent the rest of the day in
a most dejected state of mind amid denisovs hospital comrades who had
gathered round him telling them what he knew and listening to their
stories denisov was moodily silent all the evening

late in the evening when rostóv was about to leave he asked denisov
whether he had no commission for him

yes wait a bit said denisov glancing round at the officers and
taking his papers from under his pillow he went to the window where he
had an inkpot and sat down to write

it seems its no use knocking ones head against a wall he said
coming from the window and giving rostóv a large envelope in it was the
petition to the emperor drawn up by the auditor in which denisov
without alluding to the offenses of the commissariat officials simply
asked for pardon

hand it in it seems

he did not finish but gave a painfully unnatural smile





chapter xix

having returned to the regiment and told the commander the state of
denisovs affairs rostóv rode to tilsit with the letter to the emperor

on the thirteenth of june the french and russian emperors arrived in
tilsit borís drubetskóy had asked the important personage on whom he
was in attendance to include him in the suite appointed for the stay at
tilsit

i should like to see the great man he said alluding to napoleon
whom hitherto he like everyone else had always called buonaparte

you are speaking of buonaparte asked the general smiling

borís looked at his general inquiringly and immediately saw that he was
being tested

i am speaking prince of the emperor napoleon he replied the
general patted him on the shoulder with a smile

you will go far he said and took him to tilsit with him

borís was among the few present at the niemen on the day the two
emperors met he saw the raft decorated with monograms saw napoleon
pass before the french guards on the farther bank of the river saw the
pensive face of the emperor alexander as he sat in silence in a tavern
on the bank of the niemen awaiting napoleons arrival saw both emperors
get into boats and saw how napoleonreaching the raft firststepped
quickly forward to meet alexander and held out his hand to him and how
they both retired into the pavilion since he had begun to move in the
highest circles borís had made it his habit to watch attentively all
that went on around him and to note it down at the time of the meeting
at tilsit he asked the names of those who had come with napoleon and
about the uniforms they wore and listened attentively to words spoken
by important personages at the moment the emperors went into the
pavilion he looked at his watch and did not forget to look at it again
when alexander came out the interview had lasted an hour and fifty
three minutes he noted this down that same evening among other facts
he felt to be of historic importance as the emperors suite was a very
small one it was a matter of great importance for a man who valued his
success in the service to be at tilsit on the occasion of this
interview between the two emperors and having succeeded in this borís
felt that henceforth his position was fully assured he had not only
become known but people had grown accustomed to him and accepted him
twice he had executed commissions to the emperor himself so that the
latter knew his face and all those at court far from coldshouldering
him as at first when they considered him a newcomer would now have been
surprised had he been absent

borís lodged with another adjutant the polish count zhilinski
zhilinski a pole brought up in paris was rich and passionately fond
of the french and almost every day of the stay at tilsit french
officers of the guard and from french headquarters were dining and
lunching with him and borís

on the evening of the twentyfourth of june count zhilinski arranged a
supper for his french friends the guest of honor was an aidedecamp of
napoleons there were also several french officers of the guard and a
page of napoleons a young lad of an old aristocratic french family
that same day rostóv profiting by the darkness to avoid being
recognized in civilian dress came to tilsit and went to the lodging
occupied by borís and zhilinski

rostóv in common with the whole army from which he came was far from
having experienced the change of feeling toward napoleon and the
frenchwho from being foes had suddenly become friendsthat had taken
place at headquarters and in borís in the army bonaparte and the
french were still regarded with mingled feelings of anger contempt and
fear only recently talking with one of platovs cossack officers
rostóv had argued that if napoleon were taken prisoner he would be
treated not as a sovereign but as a criminal quite lately happening
to meet a wounded french colonel on the road rostóv had maintained with
heat that peace was impossible between a legitimate sovereign and the
criminal bonaparte rostóv was therefore unpleasantly struck by the
presence of french officers in borís lodging dressed in uniforms he
had been accustomed to see from quite a different point of view from the
outposts of the flank as soon as he noticed a french officer who
thrust his head out of the door that warlike feeling of hostility which
he always experienced at the sight of the enemy suddenly seized him he
stopped at the threshold and asked in russian whether drubetskóy lived
there borís hearing a strange voice in the anteroom came out to meet
him an expression of annoyance showed itself for a moment on his face
on first recognizing rostóv

ah its you very glad very glad to see you he said however
coming toward him with a smile but rostóv had noticed his first
impulse

ive come at a bad time i think i should not have come but i have
business he said coldly

no i only wonder how you managed to get away from your regiment dans
un moment je suis a vous  he said answering someone who called him

 in a minute i shall be at your disposal

i see im intruding rostóv repeated

the look of annoyance had already disappeared from borís face having
evidently reflected and decided how to act he very quietly took both
rostóvs hands and led him into the next room his eyes looking
serenely and steadily at rostóv seemed to be veiled by something as if
screened by blue spectacles of conventionality so it seemed to rostóv

oh come now as if you could come at a wrong time said borís and he
led him into the room where the supper table was laid and introduced him
to his guests explaining that he was not a civilian but an hussar
officer and an old friend of his

count zhilinskile comte n nle capitaine s s said he naming his
guests rostóv looked frowningly at the frenchmen bowed reluctantly
and remained silent

zhilinski evidently did not receive this new russian person very
willingly into his circle and did not speak to rostóv borís did not
appear to notice the constraint the newcomer produced and with the same
pleasant composure and the same veiled look in his eyes with which he
had met rostóv tried to enliven the conversation one of the frenchmen
with the politeness characteristic of his countrymen addressed the
obstinately taciturn rostóv saying that the latter had probably come to
tilsit to see the emperor

no i came on business replied rostóv briefly

rostóv had been out of humor from the moment he noticed the look of
dissatisfaction on borís face and as always happens to those in a bad
humor it seemed to him that everyone regarded him with aversion and
that he was in everybodys way he really was in their way for he alone
took no part in the conversation which again became general the looks
the visitors cast on him seemed to say and what is he sitting here
for he rose and went up to borís

anyhow im in your way he said in a low tone come and talk over my
business and ill go away

oh no not at all said borís but if you are tired come and lie
down in my room and have a rest

yes really

they went into the little room where borís slept rostóv without
sitting down began at once irritably as if borís were to blame in
some way telling him about denisovs affair asking him whether
through his general he could and would intercede with the emperor on
denisovs behalf and get denisovs petition handed in when he and borís
were alone rostóv felt for the first time that he could not look borís
in the face without a sense of awkwardness borís with one leg crossed
over the other and stroking his left hand with the slender fingers of
his right listened to rostóv as a general listens to the report of a
subordinate now looking aside and now gazing straight into rostóvs
eyes with the same veiled look each time this happened rostóv felt
uncomfortable and cast down his eyes

i have heard of such cases and know that his majesty is very severe in
such affairs i think it would be best not to bring it before the
emperor but to apply to the commander of the corps but in general
i think

so you dont want to do anything well then say so rostóv almost
shouted not looking borís in the face

borís smiled

on the contrary i will do what i can only i thought

at that moment zhilinskis voice was heard calling borís

well then go go go said rostóv and refusing supper and
remaining alone in the little room he walked up and down for a long
time hearing the lighthearted french conversation from the next room





chapter xx

rostóv had come to tilsit the day least suitable for a petition on
denisovs behalf he could not himself go to the general in attendance
as he was in mufti and had come to tilsit without permission to do so
and borís even had he wished to could not have done so on the
following day on that day june  the preliminaries of peace were
signed the emperors exchanged decorations alexander received the cross
of the legion of honor and napoleon the order of st andrew of the first
degree and a dinner had been arranged for the evening given by a
battalion of the french guards to the preobrazhensk battalion the
emperors were to be present at that banquet

rostóv felt so ill at ease and uncomfortable with borís that when the
latter looked in after supper he pretended to be asleep and early next
morning went away avoiding borís in his civilian clothes and a round
hat he wandered about the town staring at the french and their
uniforms and at the streets and houses where the russian and french
emperors were staying in a square he saw tables being set up and
preparations made for the dinner he saw the russian and french colors
draped from side to side of the streets with huge monograms a and n in
the windows of the houses also flags and bunting were displayed

borís doesnt want to help me and i dont want to ask him thats
settled thought nicholas all is over between us but i wont leave
here without having done all i can for denisov and certainly not without
getting his letter to the emperor the emperor he is here thought
rostóv who had unconsciously returned to the house where alexander
lodged

saddled horses were standing before the house and the suite were
assembling evidently preparing for the emperor to come out

i may see him at any moment thought rostóv if only i were to hand
the letter direct to him and tell him all could they really arrest me
for my civilian clothes surely not he would understand on whose side
justice lies he understands everything knows everything who can be
more just more magnanimous than he and even if they did arrest me for
being here what would it matter thought he looking at an officer who
was entering the house the emperor occupied after all people do go
in its all nonsense ill go in and hand the letter to the emperor
myself so much the worse for drubetskóy who drives me to it and
suddenly with a determination he himself did not expect rostóv felt for
the letter in his pocket and went straight to the house

no i wont miss my opportunity now as i did after austerlitz he
thought expecting every moment to meet the monarch and conscious of
the blood that rushed to his heart at the thought i will fall at his
feet and beseech him he will lift me up will listen and will even
thank me i am happy when i can do good but to remedy injustice is the
greatest happiness rostóv fancied the sovereign saying and passing
people who looked after him with curiosity he entered the porch of the
emperors house

a broad staircase led straight up from the entry and to the right he
saw a closed door below under the staircase was a door leading to the
lower floor

whom do you want someone inquired

to hand in a letter a petition to his majesty said nicholas with a
tremor in his voice

a petition this way to the officer on duty he was shown the door
leading downstairs only it wont be accepted

on hearing this indifferent voice rostóv grew frightened at what he was
doing the thought of meeting the emperor at any moment was so
fascinating and consequently so alarming that he was ready to run away
but the official who had questioned him opened the door and rostóv
entered

a short stout man of about thirty in white breeches and high boots and
a batiste shirt that he had evidently only just put on standing in that
room and his valet was buttoning on to the back of his breeches a new
pair of handsome silkembroidered braces that for some reason
attracted rostóvs attention this man was speaking to someone in the
adjoining room

a good figure and in her first bloom he was saying but on seeing
rostóv he stopped short and frowned

what is it a petition

what is it asked the person in the other room

another petitioner answered the man with the braces

tell him to come later hell be coming out directly we must go

later later tomorrow its too late

rostóv turned and was about to go but the man in the braces stopped
him

whom have you come from who are you

i come from major denisov answered rostóv

are you an officer

lieutenant count rostóv

what audacity hand it in through your commander and go along with
you go and he continued to put on the uniform the valet handed him

rostóv went back into the hall and noticed that in the porch there were
many officers and generals in full parade uniform whom he had to pass

cursing his temerity his heart sinking at the thought of finding
himself at any moment face to face with the emperor and being put to
shame and arrested in his presence fully alive now to the impropriety
of his conduct and repenting of it rostóv with downcast eyes was
making his way out of the house through the brilliant suite when a
familiar voice called him and a hand detained him

what are you doing here sir in civilian dress asked a deep voice

it was a cavalry general who had obtained the emperors special favor
during this campaign and who had formerly commanded the division in
which rostóv was serving

rostóv in dismay began justifying himself but seeing the kindly
jocular face of the general he took him aside and in an excited voice
told him the whole affair asking him to intercede for denisov whom the
general knew having heard rostóv to the end the general shook his head
gravely

im sorry sorry for that fine fellow give me the letter

hardly had rostóv handed him the letter and finished explaining
denisovs case when hasty steps and the jingling of spurs were heard on
the stairs and the general leaving him went to the porch the
gentlemen of the emperors suite ran down the stairs and went to their
horses hayne the same groom who had been at austerlitz led up the
emperors horse and the faint creak of a footstep rostóv knew at once
was heard on the stairs forgetting the danger of being recognized
rostóv went close to the porch together with some inquisitive
civilians and again after two years saw those features he adored
that same face and same look and step and the same union of majesty and
mildness and the feeling of enthusiasm and love for his sovereign
rose again in rostóvs soul in all its old force in the uniform of the
preobrazhensk regimentwhite chamoisleather breeches and high bootsand
wearing a star rostóv did not know it was that of the legion
dhonneur the monarch came out into the porch putting on his gloves
and carrying his hat under his arm he stopped and looked about him
brightening everything around by his glance he spoke a few words to
some of the generals and recognizing the former commander of rostóvs
division smiled and beckoned to him

all the suite drew back and rostóv saw the general talking for some time
to the emperor

the emperor said a few words to him and took a step toward his horse
again the crowd of members of the suite and street gazers among whom
was rostóv moved nearer to the emperor stopping beside his horse with
his hand on the saddle the emperor turned to the cavalry general and
said in a loud voice evidently wishing to be heard by all

i cannot do it general i cannot because the law is stronger than i
and he raised his foot to the stirrup

the general bowed his head respectfully and the monarch mounted and
rode down the street at a gallop beside himself with enthusiasm rostóv
ran after him with the crowd





chapter xxi

the emperor rode to the square where facing one another a battalion of
the preobrazhensk regiment stood on the right and a battalion of the
french guards in their bearskin caps on the left

as the tsar rode up to one flank of the battalions which presented
arms another group of horsemen galloped up to the opposite flank and
at the head of them rostóv recognized napoleon it could be no one else
he came at a gallop wearing a small hat a blue uniform open over a
white vest and the st andrew ribbon over his shoulder he was riding a
very fine thoroughbred gray arab horse with a crimson goldembroidered
saddlecloth on approaching alexander he raised his hat and as he did
so rostóv with his cavalrymans eye could not help noticing that
napoleon did not sit well or firmly in the saddle the battalions
shouted hurrah and vive lempereur napoleon said something to
alexander and both emperors dismounted and took each others hands
napoleons face wore an unpleasant and artificial smile alexander was
saying something affable to him

in spite of the trampling of the french gendarmes horses which were
pushing back the crowd rostóv kept his eyes on every movement of
alexander and bonaparte it struck him as a surprise that alexander
treated bonaparte as an equal and that the latter was quite at ease with
the tsar as if such relations with an emperor were an everyday matter
to him

alexander and napoleon with the long train of their suites approached
the right flank of the preobrazhensk battalion and came straight up to
the crowd standing there the crowd unexpectedly found itself so close
to the emperors that rostóv standing in the front row was afraid he
might be recognized

sire i ask your permission to present the legion of honor to the
bravest of your soldiers said a sharp precise voice articulating
every letter

this was said by the undersized napoleon looking up straight into
alexanders eyes alexander listened attentively to what was said to him
and bending his head smiled pleasantly

to him who has borne himself most bravely in this last war added
napoleon accentuating each syllable as with a composure and assurance
exasperating to rostóv he ran his eyes over the russian ranks drawn up
before him who all presented arms with their eyes fixed on their
emperor

will your majesty allow me to consult the colonel said alexander and
took a few hasty steps toward prince kozlovski the commander of the
battalion

bonaparte meanwhile began taking the glove off his small white hand
tore it in doing so and threw it away an aidedecamp behind him
rushed forward and picked it up

to whom shall it be given the emperor alexander asked koslovski in
russian in a low voice

to whomever your majesty commands

the emperor knit his brows with dissatisfaction and glancing back
remarked

but we must give him an answer

kozlovski scanned the ranks resolutely and included rostóv in his
scrutiny

can it be me thought rostóv

lazarev the colonel called with a frown and lazarev the first
soldier in the rank stepped briskly forward

where are you off to stop here voices whispered to lazarev who did
not know where to go lazarev stopped casting a sidelong look at his
colonel in alarm his face twitched as often happens to soldiers called
before the ranks

napoleon slightly turned his head and put his plump little hand out
behind him as if to take something the members of his suite guessing
at once what he wanted moved about and whispered as they passed
something from one to another and a pagethe same one rostóv had seen
the previous evening at borísran forward and bowing respectfully over
the outstretched hand and not keeping it waiting a moment laid in it an
order on a red ribbon napoleon without looking pressed two fingers
together and the badge was between them then he approached lazarev who
rolled his eyes and persistently gazed at his own monarch looked round
at the emperor alexander to imply that what he was now doing was done
for the sake of his ally and the small white hand holding the order
touched one of lazarevs buttons it was as if napoleon knew that it was
only necessary for his hand to deign to touch that soldiers breast for
the soldier to be forever happy rewarded and distinguished from
everyone else in the world napoleon merely laid the cross on lazarevs
breast and dropping his hand turned toward alexander as though sure
that the cross would adhere there and it really did

officious hands russian and french immediately seized the cross and
fastened it to the uniform lazarev glanced morosely at the little man
with white hands who was doing something to him and still standing
motionless presenting arms looked again straight into alexanders eyes
as if asking whether he should stand there or go away or do something
else but receiving no orders he remained for some time in that rigid
position

the emperors remounted and rode away the preobrazhensk battalion
breaking rank mingled with the french guards and sat down at the tables
prepared for them

lazarev sat in the place of honor russian and french officers embraced
him congratulated him and pressed his hands crowds of officers and
civilians drew near merely to see him a rumble of russian and french
voices and laughter filled the air round the tables in the square two
officers with flushed faces looking cheerful and happy passed by
rostóv

what dyou think of the treat all on silver plate one of them was
saying have you seen lazarev

i have

tomorrow i hear the preobrazhenskis will give them a dinner

yes but what luck for lazarev twelve hundred francs pension for
life

heres a cap lads shouted a preobrazhensk soldier donning a shaggy
french cap

its a fine thing firstrate

have you heard the password asked one guards officer of another
the day before yesterday it was napoleon france bravoure
yesterday alexandre russie grandeur one day our emperor gives it
and next day napoleon tomorrow our emperor will send a st georges
cross to the bravest of the french guards it has to be done he must
respond in kind

borís too with his friend zhilinski came to see the preobrazhensk
banquet on his way back he noticed rostóv standing by the corner of a
house

rostóv how dyou do we missed one another he said and could not
refrain from asking what was the matter so strangely dismal and
troubled was rostóvs face

nothing nothing replied rostóv

youll call round

yes i will

rostóv stood at that corner for a long time watching the feast from a
distance in his mind a painful process was going on which he could not
bring to a conclusion terrible doubts rose in his soul now he
remembered denisov with his changed expression his submission and the
whole hospital with arms and legs torn off and its dirt and disease so
vividly did he recall that hospital stench of dead flesh that he looked
round to see where the smell came from next he thought of that self
satisfied bonaparte with his small white hand who was now an emperor
liked and respected by alexander then why those severed arms and legs
and those dead men then again he thought of lazarev rewarded and
denisov punished and unpardoned he caught himself harboring such
strange thoughts that he was frightened

the smell of the food the preobrazhenskis were eating and a sense of
hunger recalled him from these reflections he had to get something to
eat before going away he went to a hotel he had noticed that morning
there he found so many people among them officers who like himself
had come in civilian clothes that he had difficulty in getting a
dinner two officers of his own division joined him the conversation
naturally turned on the peace the officers his comrades like most of
the army were dissatisfied with the peace concluded after the battle of
friedland they said that had we held out a little longer napoleon would
have been done for as his troops had neither provisions nor ammunition
nicholas ate and drank chiefly the latter in silence he finished a
couple of bottles of wine by himself the process in his mind went on
tormenting him without reaching a conclusion he feared to give way to
his thoughts yet could not get rid of them suddenly on one of the
officers saying that it was humiliating to look at the french rostóv
began shouting with uncalledfor wrath and therefore much to the
surprise of the officers

how can you judge whats best he cried the blood suddenly rushing to
his face how can you judge the emperors actions what right have we
to argue we cannot comprehend either the emperors aims or his
actions

but i never said a word about the emperor said the officer
justifying himself and unable to understand rostóvs outburst except
on the supposition that he was drunk

but rostóv did not listen to him

we are not diplomatic officials we are soldiers and nothing more he
went on if we are ordered to die we must die if were punished it
means that we have deserved it its not for us to judge if the emperor
pleases to recognize bonaparte as emperor and to conclude an alliance
with him it means that that is the right thing to do if once we begin
judging and arguing about everything nothing sacred will be left that
way we shall be saying there is no godnothing shouted nicholas
banging the tablevery little to the point as it seemed to his
listeners but quite relevantly to the course of his own thoughts

our business is to do our duty to fight and not to think thats
all said he

and to drink said one of the officers not wishing to quarrel

yes and to drink assented nicholas hullo there another bottle
he shouted

in  the emperor alexander went to erfurt for a fresh interview with
the emperor napoleon and in the upper circles of petersburg there was
much talk of the grandeur of this important meeting





chapter xxii

in  the intimacy between the worlds two arbiters as napoleon and
alexander were called was such that when napoleon declared war on
austria a russian corps crossed the frontier to cooperate with our old
enemy bonaparte against our old ally the emperor of austria and in
court circles the possibility of marriage between napoleon and one of
alexanders sisters was spoken of but besides considerations of foreign
policy the attention of russian society was at that time keenly
directed on the internal changes that were being undertaken in all the
departments of government

life meanwhilereal life with its essential interests of health and
sickness toil and rest and its intellectual interests in thought
science poetry music love friendship hatred and passionswent on
as usual independently of and apart from political friendship or enmity
with napoleon bonaparte and from all the schemes of reconstruction





book six





chapter i

prince andrew had spent two years continuously in the country

all the plans pierre had attempted on his estatesand constantly
changing from one thing to another had never accomplishedwere carried
out by prince andrew without display and without perceptible difficulty

he had in the highest degree a practical tenacity which pierre lacked
and without fuss or strain on his part this set things going

on one of his estates the three hundred serfs were liberated and became
free agricultural laborersthis being one of the first examples of the
kind in russia on other estates the serfs compulsory labor was
commuted for a quitrent a trained midwife was engaged for bogucharovo
at his expense and a priest was paid to teach reading and writing to
the children of the peasants and household serfs

prince andrew spent half his time at bald hills with his father and his
son who was still in the care of nurses the other half he spent in
bogucharovo cloister as his father called prince andrews estate
despite the indifference to the affairs of the world he had expressed to
pierre he diligently followed all that went on received many books
and to his surprise noticed that when he or his father had visitors from
petersburg the very vortex of life these people lagged behind
himselfwho never left the countryin knowledge of what was happening in
home and foreign affairs

besides being occupied with his estates and reading a great variety of
books prince andrew was at this time busy with a critical survey of our
last two unfortunate campaigns and with drawing up a proposal for a
reform of the army rules and regulations

in the spring of  he went to visit the ryazan estates which had been
inherited by his son whose guardian he was

warmed by the spring sunshine he sat in the caleche looking at the new
grass the first leaves on the birches and the first puffs of white
spring clouds floating across the clear blue sky he was not thinking of
anything but looked absentmindedly and cheerfully from side to side

they crossed the ferry where he had talked with pierre the year before
they went through the muddy village past threshing floors and green
fields of winter rye downhill where snow still lodged near the bridge
uphill where the clay had been liquefied by the rain past strips of
stubble land and bushes touched with green here and there and into a
birch forest growing on both sides of the road in the forest it was
almost hot no wind could be felt the birches with their sticky green
leaves were motionless and lilaccolored flowers and the first blades
of green grass were pushing up and lifting last years leaves the
coarse evergreen color of the small fir trees scattered here and there
among the birches was an unpleasant reminder of winter on entering the
forest the horses began to snort and sweated visibly

peter the footman made some remark to the coachman the latter assented
but apparently the coachmans sympathy was not enough for peter and he
turned on the box toward his master

how pleasant it is your excellency he said with a respectful smile

what

its pleasant your excellency

what is he talking about thought prince andrew oh the spring i
suppose he thought as he turned round yes really everything is
green already how early the birches and cherry and alders too are
coming out but the oaks show no sign yet ah here is one oak

at the edge of the road stood an oak probably ten times the age of the
birches that formed the forest it was ten times as thick and twice as
tall as they it was an enormous tree its girth twice as great as a man
could embrace and evidently long ago some of its branches had been
broken off and its bark scarred with its huge ungainly limbs sprawling
unsymmetrically and its gnarled hands and fingers it stood an aged
stern and scornful monster among the smiling birch trees only the
deadlooking evergreen firs dotted about in the forest and this oak
refused to yield to the charm of spring or notice either the spring or
the sunshine

spring love happiness this oak seemed to say are you not weary of
that stupid meaningless constantly repeated fraud always the same and
always a fraud there is no spring no sun no happiness look at those
cramped dead firs ever the same and at me too sticking out my broken
and barked fingers just where they have grown whether from my back or
my sides as they have grown so i stand and i do not believe in your
hopes and your lies

as he passed through the forest prince andrew turned several times to
look at that oak as if expecting something from it under the oak too
were flowers and grass but it stood among them scowling rigid
misshapen and grim as ever

yes the oak is right a thousand times right thought prince andrew
let othersthe youngyield afresh to that fraud but we know life our
life is finished

a whole sequence of new thoughts hopeless but mournfully pleasant rose
in his soul in connection with that tree during this journey he as it
were considered his life afresh and arrived at his old conclusion
restful in its hopelessness that it was not for him to begin anything
anewbut that he must live out his life content to do no harm and not
disturbing himself or desiring anything





chapter ii

prince andrew had to see the marshal of the nobility for the district in
connection with the affairs of the ryazan estate of which he was
trustee this marshal was count ilyá rostóv and in the middle of may
prince andrew went to visit him

it was now hot spring weather the whole forest was already clothed in
green it was dusty and so hot that on passing near water one longed to
bathe

prince andrew depressed and preoccupied with the business about which
he had to speak to the marshal was driving up the avenue in the grounds
of the rostóvs house at otradnoe he heard merry girlish cries behind
some trees on the right and saw a group of girls running to cross the
path of his caleche ahead of the rest and nearer to him ran a dark
haired remarkably slim pretty girl in a yellow chintz dress with a
white handkerchief on her head from under which loose locks of hair
escaped the girl was shouting something but seeing that he was a
stranger ran back laughing without looking at him

suddenly he did not know why he felt a pang the day was so beautiful
the sun so bright everything around so gay but that slim pretty girl
did not know or wish to know of his existence and was contented and
cheerful in her own separateprobably foolishbut bright and happy life
what is she so glad about what is she thinking of not of the military
regulations or of the arrangement of the ryazan serfs quitrents of
what is she thinking why is she so happy prince andrew asked himself
with instinctive curiosity

in  count ilyá rostóv was living at otradnoe just as he had done in
former years that is entertaining almost the whole province with
hunts theatricals dinners and music he was glad to see prince
andrew as he was to see any new visitor and insisted on his staying
the night

during the dull day in the course of which he was entertained by his
elderly hosts and by the more important of the visitors the old counts
house was crowded on account of an approaching name day prince andrew
repeatedly glanced at natásha gay and laughing among the younger
members of the company and asked himself each time what is she
thinking about why is she so glad

that night alone in new surroundings he was long unable to sleep he
read awhile and then put out his candle but relit it it was hot in the
room the inside shutters of which were closed he was cross with the
stupid old man as he called rostóv who had made him stay by assuring
him that some necessary documents had not yet arrived from town and he
was vexed with himself for having stayed

he got up and went to the window to open it as soon as he opened the
shutters the moonlight as if it had long been watching for this burst
into the room he opened the casement the night was fresh bright and
very still just before the window was a row of pollard trees looking
black on one side and with a silvery light on the other beneath the
trees grew some kind of lush wet bushy vegetation with silverlit
leaves and stems here and there farther back beyond the dark trees a
roof glittered with dew to the right was a leafy tree with brilliantly
white trunk and branches and above it shone the moon nearly at its
full in a pale almost starless spring sky prince andrew leaned his
elbows on the window ledge and his eyes rested on that sky

his room was on the first floor those in the rooms above were also
awake he heard female voices overhead

just once more said a girlish voice above him which prince andrew
recognized at once

but when are you coming to bed replied another voice

i wont i cant sleep whats the use come now for the last time

two girlish voices sang a musical passagethe end of some song

oh how lovely now go to sleep and theres an end of it

you go to sleep but i cant said the first voice coming nearer to
the window she was evidently leaning right out for the rustle of her
dress and even her breathing could be heard everything was stonestill
like the moon and its light and the shadows prince andrew too dared
not stir for fear of betraying his unintentional presence

sónya sónya he again heard the first speaker oh how can you
sleep only look how glorious it is ah how glorious do wake up
sónya she said almost with tears in her voice there never never was
such a lovely night before

sónya made some reluctant reply

do just come and see what a moon oh how lovely come here
darling sweetheart come here there you see i feel like sitting down
on my heels putting my arms round my knees like this straining tight
as tight as possible and flying away like this

take care youll fall out

he heard the sound of a scuffle and sónyas disapproving voice its
past one oclock

oh you only spoil things for me all right go go

again all was silent but prince andrew knew she was still sitting
there from time to time he heard a soft rustle and at times a sigh

o god o god what does it mean she suddenly exclaimed to bed then
if it must be and she slammed the casement

for her i might as well not exist thought prince andrew while he
listened to her voice for some reason expecting yet fearing that she
might say something about him there she is again as if it were on
purpose thought he

in his soul there suddenly arose such an unexpected turmoil of youthful
thoughts and hopes contrary to the whole tenor of his life that unable
to explain his condition to himself he lay down and fell asleep at once





chapter iii

next morning having taken leave of no one but the count and not
waiting for the ladies to appear prince andrew set off for home

it was already the beginning of june when on his return journey he drove
into the birch forest where the gnarled old oak had made so strange and
memorable an impression on him in the forest the harness bells sounded
yet more muffled than they had done six weeks before for now all was
thick shady and dense and the young firs dotted about in the forest
did not jar on the general beauty but lending themselves to the mood
around were delicately green with fluffy young shoots

the whole day had been hot somewhere a storm was gathering but only a
small cloud had scattered some raindrops lightly sprinkling the road
and the sappy leaves the left side of the forest was dark in the shade
the right side glittered in the sunlight wet and shiny and scarcely
swayed by the breeze everything was in blossom the nightingales
trilled and their voices reverberated now near now far away

yes here in this forest was that oak with which i agreed thought
prince andrew but where is it he again wondered gazing at the left
side of the road and without recognizing it he looked with admiration
at the very oak he sought the old oak quite transfigured spreading
out a canopy of sappy darkgreen foliage stood rapt and slightly
trembling in the rays of the evening sun neither gnarled fingers nor
old scars nor old doubts and sorrows were any of them in evidence now
through the hard centuryold bark even where there were no twigs
leaves had sprouted such as one could hardly believe the old veteran
could have produced

yes it is the same oak thought prince andrew and all at once he was
seized by an unreasoning springtime feeling of joy and renewal all the
best moments of his life suddenly rose to his memory austerlitz with
the lofty heavens his wifes dead reproachful face pierre at the
ferry that girl thrilled by the beauty of the night and that night
itself and the moon and all this rushed suddenly to his mind

no life is not over at thirtyone prince andrew suddenly decided
finally and decisively it is not enough for me to know what i have in
meeveryone must know it pierre and that young girl who wanted to fly
away into the sky everyone must know me so that my life may not be
lived for myself alone while others live so apart from it but so that
it may be reflected in them all and they and i may live in harmony

on reaching home prince andrew decided to go to petersburg that autumn
and found all sorts of reasons for this decision a whole series of
sensible and logical considerations showing it to be essential for him
to go to petersburg and even to reenter the service kept springing up
in his mind he could not now understand how he could ever even have
doubted the necessity of taking an active share in life just as a month
before he had not understood how the idea of leaving the quiet country
could ever enter his head it now seemed clear to him that all his
experience of life must be senselessly wasted unless he applied it to
some kind of work and again played an active part in life he did not
even remember how formerly on the strength of similar wretched logical
arguments it had seemed obvious that he would be degrading himself if
he now after the lessons he had had in life allowed himself to believe
in the possibility of being useful and in the possibility of happiness
or love now reason suggested quite the opposite after that journey to
ryazan he found the country dull his former pursuits no longer
interested him and often when sitting alone in his study he got up
went to the mirror and gazed a long time at his own face then he would
turn away to the portrait of his dead lise who with hair curled a la
grecque looked tenderly and gaily at him out of the gilt frame she did
not now say those former terrible words to him but looked simply
merrily and inquisitively at him and prince andrew crossing his arms
behind him long paced the room now frowning now smiling as he
reflected on those irrational inexpressible thoughts secret as a
crime which altered his whole life and were connected with pierre with
fame with the girl at the window the oak and womans beauty and love
and if anyone came into his room at such moments he was particularly
cold stern and above all unpleasantly logical

my dear princess mary entering at such a moment would say little
nicholas cant go out today its very cold

if it were hot prince andrew would reply at such times very dryly to
his sister he could go out in his smock but as it is cold he must
wear warm clothes which were designed for that purpose that is what
follows from the fact that it is cold and not that a child who needs
fresh air should remain at home he would add with extreme logic as if
punishing someone for those secret illogical emotions that stirred
within him

at such moments princess mary would think how intellectual work dries
men up





chapter iv

prince andrew arrived in petersburg in august  it was the time
when the youthful speranski was at the zenith of his fame and his
reforms were being pushed forward with the greatest energy that same
august the emperor was thrown from his caleche injured his leg and
remained three weeks at peterhof receiving speranski every day and no
one else at that time the two famous decrees were being prepared that
so agitated societyabolishing court ranks and introducing examinations
to qualify for the grades of collegiate assessor and state councilorand
not merely these but a whole state constitution intended to change the
existing order of government in russia legal administrative and
financial from the council of state down to the district tribunals now
those vague liberal dreams with which the emperor alexander had ascended
the throne and which he had tried to put into effect with the aid of
his associates czartoryski novosíltsev kochubey and strogonovwhom
he himself in jest had called his comite de salut publicwere taking
shape and being realized

now all these men were replaced by speranski on the civil side and
arakcheev on the military soon after his arrival prince andrew as a
gentleman of the chamber presented himself at court and at a levee the
emperor though he met him twice did not favor him with a single word
it had always seemed to prince andrew before that he was antipathetic to
the emperor and that the latter disliked his face and personality
generally and in the cold repellent glance the emperor gave him he
now found further confirmation of this surmise the courtiers explained
the emperors neglect of him by his majestys displeasure at bolkónskis
not having served since

i know myself that one cannot help ones sympathies and antipathies
thought prince andrew so it will not do to present my proposal for the
reform of the army regulations to the emperor personally but the
project will speak for itself

he mentioned what he had written to an old field marshal a friend of
his fathers the field marshal made an appointment to see him received
him graciously and promised to inform the emperor a few days later
prince andrew received notice that he was to go to see the minister of
war count arakcheev

on the appointed day prince andrew entered count arakcheevs waiting
room at nine in the morning

he did not know arakcheev personally had never seen him and all he had
heard of him inspired him with but little respect for the man

he is minister of war a man trusted by the emperor and i need not
concern myself about his personal qualities he has been commissioned to
consider my project so he alone can get it adopted thought prince
andrew as he waited among a number of important and unimportant people
in count arakcheevs waiting room

during his service chiefly as an adjutant prince andrew had seen the
anterooms of many important men and the different types of such rooms
were well known to him count arakcheevs anteroom had quite a special
character the faces of the unimportant people awaiting their turn for
an audience showed embarrassment and servility the faces of those of
higher rank expressed a common feeling of awkwardness covered by a mask
of unconcern and ridicule of themselves their situation and the person
for whom they were waiting some walked thoughtfully up and down others
whispered and laughed prince andrew heard the nickname sila
andréevich and the words uncle will give it to us hot in reference
to count arakcheev one general an important personage evidently
feeling offended at having to wait so long sat crossing and uncrossing
his legs and smiling contemptuously to himself

but the moment the door opened one feeling alone appeared on all
facesthat of fear prince andrew for the second time asked the adjutant
on duty to take in his name but received an ironical look and was told
that his turn would come in due course after some others had been shown
in and out of the ministers room by the adjutant on duty an officer
who struck prince andrew by his humiliated and frightened air was
admitted at that terrible door this officers audience lasted a long
time then suddenly the grating sound of a harsh voice was heard from
the other side of the door and the officerwith pale face and trembling
lipscame out and passed through the waiting room clutching his head

after this prince andrew was conducted to the door and the officer on
duty said in a whisper to the right at the window

prince andrew entered a plain tidy room and saw at the table a man of
forty with a long waist a long closely cropped head deep wrinkles
scowling brows above dull greenishhazel eyes and an overhanging red
nose arakcheev turned his head toward him without looking at him

what is your petition asked arakcheev

i am not petitioning your excellency returned prince andrew quietly

arakcheevs eyes turned toward him

sit down said he prince bolkónski

i am not petitioning about anything his majesty the emperor has
deigned to send your excellency a project submitted by me

you see my dear sir i have read your project interrupted arakcheev
uttering only the first words amiably and thenagain without looking at
prince andrewrelapsing gradually into a tone of grumbling contempt
you are proposing new military laws there are many laws but no one to
carry out the old ones nowadays everybody designs laws it is easier
writing than doing

i came at his majesty the emperors wish to learn from your excellency
how you propose to deal with the memorandum i have presented said
prince andrew politely

i have endorsed a resolution on your memorandum and sent it to the
committee i do not approve of it said arakcheev rising and taking a
paper from his writing table here and he handed it to prince andrew

across the paper was scrawled in pencil without capital letters
misspelled and without punctuation unsoundly constructed because
resembles an imitation of the french military code and from the articles
of war needlessly deviating

to what committee has the memorandum been referred inquired prince
andrew

to the committee on army regulations and i have recommended that your
honor should be appointed a member but without a salary

prince andrew smiled

i dont want one

a member without salary repeated arakcheev i have the honor eh
call the next one who else is there he shouted bowing to prince
andrew





chapter v

while waiting for the announcement of his appointment to the committee
prince andrew looked up his former acquaintances particularly those he
knew to be in power and whose aid he might need in petersburg he now
experienced the same feeling he had had on the eve of a battle when
troubled by anxious curiosity and irresistibly attracted to the ruling
circles where the future on which the fate of millions depended was
being shaped from the irritation of the older men the curiosity of the
uninitiated the reserve of the initiated the hurry and preoccupation
of everyone and the innumerable committees and commissions of whose
existence he learned every day he felt that now in  here in
petersburg a vast civil conflict was in preparation the commander in
chief of which was a mysterious person he did not know but who was
supposed to be a man of geniussperanski and this movement of
reconstruction of which prince andrew had a vague idea and speranski
its chief promoter began to interest him so keenly that the question of
the army regulations quickly receded to a secondary place in his
consciousness

prince andrew was most favorably placed to secure good reception in the
highest and most diverse petersburg circles of the day the reforming
party cordially welcomed and courted him in the first place because he
was reputed to be clever and very well read and secondly because by
liberating his serfs he had obtained the reputation of being a liberal
the party of the old and dissatisfied who censured the innovations
turned to him expecting his sympathy in their disapproval of the
reforms simply because he was the son of his father the feminine
society world welcomed him gladly because he was rich distinguished a
good match and almost a newcomer with a halo of romance on account of
his supposed death and the tragic loss of his wife besides this the
general opinion of all who had known him previously was that he had
greatly improved during these last five years having softened and grown
more manly lost his former affectation pride and contemptuous irony
and acquired the serenity that comes with years people talked about
him were interested in him and wanted to meet him

the day after his interview with count arakcheev prince andrew spent
the evening at count kochubeys he told the count of his interview with
sila andréevich kochubey spoke of arakcheev by that nickname with the
same vague irony prince andrew had noticed in the minister of wars
anteroom

mon cher even in this case you cant do without michael mikhaylovich
speranski he manages everything ill speak to him he has promised to
come this evening

what has speranski to do with the army regulations asked prince
andrew

kochubey shook his head smilingly as if surprised at bolkónskis
simplicity

we were talking to him about you a few days ago kochubey continued
and about your freed plowmen

oh is it you prince who have freed your serfs said an old man of
catherines day turning contemptuously toward bolkónski

it was a small estate that brought in no profit replied prince
andrew trying to extenuate his action so as not to irritate the old man
uselessly

afraid of being late said the old man looking at kochubey

theres one thing i dont understand he continued who will plow the
land if they are set free it is easy to write laws but difficult to
rule just the same as nowi ask you countwho will be heads of the
departments when everybody has to pass examinations

those who pass the examinations i suppose replied kochubey crossing
his legs and glancing round

well i have pryanichnikov serving under me a splendid man a
priceless man but hes sixty is he to go up for examination

yes thats a difficulty as education is not at all general but

count kochubey did not finish he rose took prince andrew by the arm
and went to meet a tall bald fair man of about forty with a large open
forehead and a long face of unusual and peculiar whiteness who was just
entering the newcomer wore a blue swallowtail coat with a cross
suspended from his neck and a star on his left breast it was speranski
prince andrew recognized him at once and felt a throb within him as
happens at critical moments of life whether it was from respect envy
or anticipation he did not know speranskis whole figure was of a
peculiar type that made him easily recognizable in the society in which
prince andrew lived he had never seen anyone who together with awkward
and clumsy gestures possessed such calmness and selfassurance he had
never seen so resolute yet gentle an expression as that in those half
closed rather humid eyes or so firm a smile that expressed nothing
nor had he heard such a refined smooth soft voice above all he had
never seen such delicate whiteness of face or handshands which were
broad but very plump soft and white such whiteness and softness
prince andrew had only seen on the faces of soldiers who had been long
in hospital this was speranski secretary of state reporter to the
emperor and his companion at erfurt where he had more than once met and
talked with napoleon

speranski did not shift his eyes from one face to another as people
involuntarily do on entering a large company and was in no hurry to
speak he spoke slowly with assurance that he would be listened to and
he looked only at the person with whom he was conversing

prince andrew followed speranskis every word and movement with
particular attention as happens to some people especially to men who
judge those near to them severely he always on meeting anyone
newespecially anyone whom like speranski he knew by
reputationexpected to discover in him the perfection of human
qualities

speranski told kochubey he was sorry he had been unable to come sooner
as he had been detained at the palace he did not say that the emperor
had kept him and prince andrew noticed this affectation of modesty
when kochubey introduced prince andrew speranski slowly turned his eyes
to bolkónski with his customary smile and looked at him in silence

i am very glad to make your acquaintance i had heard of you as
everyone has he said after a pause

kochubey said a few words about the reception arakcheev had given
bolkónski speranski smiled more markedly

the chairman of the committee on army regulations is my good friend
monsieur magnitski he said fully articulating every word and
syllable and if you like i can put you in touch with him he paused
at the full stop i hope you will find him sympathetic and ready to co
operate in promoting all that is reasonable

a circle soon formed round speranski and the old man who had talked
about his subordinate pryanichnikov addressed a question to him

prince andrew without joining in the conversation watched every movement
of speranskis this man not long since an insignificant divinity
student who now bolkónski thought held in his handsthose plump white
handsthe fate of russia prince andrew was struck by the
extraordinarily disdainful composure with which speranski answered the
old man he appeared to address condescending words to him from an
immeasurable height when the old man began to speak too loud speranski
smiled and said he could not judge of the advantage or disadvantage of
what pleased the sovereign

having talked for a little while in the general circle speranski rose
and coming up to prince andrew took him along to the other end of the
room it was clear that he thought it necessary to interest himself in
bolkónski

i had no chance to talk with you prince during the animated
conversation in which that venerable gentleman involved me he said
with a mildly contemptuous smile as if intimating by that smile that he
and prince andrew understood the insignificance of the people with whom
he had just been talking this flattered prince andrew i have known of
you for a long time first from your action with regard to your serfs a
first example of which it is very desirable that there should be more
imitators and secondly because you are one of those gentlemen of the
chamber who have not considered themselves offended by the new decree
concerning the ranks allotted to courtiers which is causing so much
gossip and tittletattle

no said prince andrew my father did not wish me to take advantage
of the privilege i began the service from the lower grade

your father a man of the last century evidently stands above our
contemporaries who so condemn this measure which merely reestablishes
natural justice

i think however that these condemnations have some ground returned
prince andrew trying to resist speranskis influence of which he began
to be conscious he did not like to agree with him in everything and
felt a wish to contradict though he usually spoke easily and well he
felt a difficulty in expressing himself now while talking with
speranski he was too much absorbed in observing the famous mans
personality

grounds of personal ambition maybe speranski put in quietly

and of state interest to some extent said prince andrew

what do you mean asked speranski quietly lowering his eyes

i am an admirer of montesquieu replied prince andrew and his idea
that le principe des monarchies est lhonneur me parait incontestable
certains droits et privileges de la noblesse me paraissent etre des
moyens de soutenir ce sentiment

 the principle of monarchies is honor seems to me incontestable
certain rights and privileges for the aristocracy appear to me a means
of maintaining that sentiment

the smile vanished from speranskis white face which was much improved
by the change probably prince andrews thought interested him

si vous envisagez la question sous ce point de vue  he began
pronouncing french with evident difficulty and speaking even slower
than in russian but quite calmly

 if you regard the question from that point of view

speranski went on to say that honor lhonneur cannot be upheld by
privileges harmful to the service that honor lhonneur is either a
negative concept of not doing what is blameworthy or it is a source of
emulation in pursuit of commendation and rewards which recognize it
his arguments were concise simple and clear

an institution upholding honor the source of emulation is one similar
to the legion dhonneur of the great emperor napoleon not harmful but
helpful to the success of the service but not a class or court
privilege

i do not dispute that but it cannot be denied that court privileges
have attained the same end returned prince andrew every courtier
considers himself bound to maintain his position worthily

yet you do not care to avail yourself of the privilege prince said
speranski indicating by a smile that he wished to finish amiably an
argument which was embarrassing for his companion if you will do me
the honor of calling on me on wednesday he added i will after
talking with magnitski let you know what may interest you and shall
also have the pleasure of a more detailed chat with you

closing his eyes he bowed a la francaise without taking leave and
trying to attract as little attention as possible he left the room





chapter vi

during the first weeks of his stay in petersburg prince andrew felt the
whole trend of thought he had formed during his life of seclusion quite
overshadowed by the trifling cares that engrossed him in that city

on returning home in the evening he would jot down in his notebook four
or five necessary calls or appointments for certain hours the mechanism
of life the arrangement of the day so as to be in time everywhere
absorbed the greater part of his vital energy he did nothing did not
even think or find time to think but only talked and talked
successfully of what he had thought while in the country

he sometimes noticed with dissatisfaction that he repeated the same
remark on the same day in different circles but he was so busy for
whole days together that he had no time to notice that he was thinking
of nothing

as he had done on their first meeting at kochubeys speranski produced
a strong impression on prince andrew on the wednesday when he received
him têteàtête at his own house and talked to him long and
confidentially

to bolkónski so many people appeared contemptible and insignificant
creatures and he so longed to find in someone the living ideal of that
perfection toward which he strove that he readily believed that in
speranski he had found this ideal of a perfectly rational and virtuous
man had speranski sprung from the same class as himself and possessed
the same breeding and traditions bolkónski would soon have discovered
his weak human unheroic sides but as it was speranskis strange and
logical turn of mind inspired him with respect all the more because he
did not quite understand him moreover speranski either because he
appreciated the others capacity or because he considered it necessary
to win him to his side showed off his dispassionate calm reasonableness
before prince andrew and flattered him with that subtle flattery which
goes hand in hand with selfassurance and consists in a tacit assumption
that ones companion is the only man besides oneself capable of
understanding the folly of the rest of mankind and the reasonableness
and profundity of ones own ideas

during their long conversation on wednesday evening speranski more than
once remarked we regard everything that is above the common level of
rooted custom or with a smile but we want the wolves to be fed
and the sheep to be safe or they cannot understand this and
all in a way that seemed to say we you and i understand what they
are and who we are

this first long conversation with speranski only strengthened in prince
andrew the feeling he had experienced toward him at their first meeting
he saw in him a remarkable clearthinking man of vast intellect who by
his energy and persistence had attained power which he was using solely
for the welfare of russia in prince andrews eyes speranski was the man
he would himself have wished to beone who explained all the facts of
life reasonably considered important only what was rational and was
capable of applying the standard of reason to everything everything
seemed so simple and clear in speranskis exposition that prince andrew
involuntarily agreed with him about everything if he replied and
argued it was only because he wished to maintain his independence and
not submit to speranskis opinions entirely everything was right and
everything was as it should be only one thing disconcerted prince
andrew this was speranskis cold mirrorlike look which did not allow
one to penetrate to his soul and his delicate white hands which prince
andrew involuntarily watched as one does watch the hands of those who
possess power this mirrorlike gaze and those delicate hands irritated
prince andrew he knew not why he was unpleasantly struck too by the
excessive contempt for others that he observed in speranski and by the
diversity of lines of argument he used to support his opinions he made
use of every kind of mental device except analogy and passed too
boldly it seemed to prince andrew from one to another now he would
take up the position of a practical man and condemn dreamers now that
of a satirist and laugh ironically at his opponents now grow severely
logical or suddenly rise to the realm of metaphysics this last
resource was one he very frequently employed he would transfer a
question to metaphysical heights pass on to definitions of space time
and thought and having deduced the refutation he needed would again
descend to the level of the original discussion

in general the trait of speranskis mentality which struck prince andrew
most was his absolute and unshakable belief in the power and authority
of reason it was evident that the thought could never occur to him
which to prince andrew seemed so natural namely that it is after all
impossible to express all one thinks and that he had never felt the
doubt is not all i think and believe nonsense and it was just this
peculiarity of speranskis mind that particularly attracted prince
andrew

during the first period of their acquaintance bolkónski felt a
passionate admiration for him similar to that which he had once felt for
bonaparte the fact that speranski was the son of a village priest and
that stupid people might meanly despise him on account of his humble
origin as in fact many did caused prince andrew to cherish his
sentiment for him the more and unconsciously to strengthen it

on that first evening bolkónski spent with him having mentioned the
commission for the revision of the code of laws speranski told him
sarcastically that the commission had existed for a hundred and fifty
years had cost millions and had done nothing except that rosenkampf
had stuck labels on the corresponding paragraphs of the different codes

and that is all the state has for the millions it has spent said he
we want to give the senate new juridical powers but we have no laws
that is why it is a sin for men like you prince not to serve in these
times

prince andrew said that for that work an education in jurisprudence was
needed which he did not possess

but nobody possesses it so what would you have it is a vicious circle
from which we must break a way out

a week later prince andrew was a member of the committee on army
regulations andwhat he had not at all expectedwas chairman of a
section of the committee for the revision of the laws at speranskis
request he took the first part of the civil code that was being drawn up
and with the aid of the code napoleon and the institutes of justinian
he worked at formulating the section on personal rights





chapter vii

nearly two years before this in  pierre on returning to petersburg
after visiting his estates had involuntarily found himself in a leading
position among the petersburg freemasons he arranged dining and funeral
lodge meetings enrolled new members and busied himself uniting various
lodges and acquiring authentic charters he gave money for the erection
of temples and supplemented as far as he could the collection of alms
in regard to which the majority of members were stingy and irregular he
supported almost singlehanded a poorhouse the order had founded in
petersburg

his life meanwhile continued as before with the same infatuations and
dissipations he liked to dine and drink well and though he considered
it immoral and humiliating could not resist the temptations of the
bachelor circles in which he moved

amid the turmoil of his activities and distractions however pierre at
the end of a year began to feel that the more firmly he tried to rest
upon it the more masonic ground on which he stood gave way under him
at the same time he felt that the deeper the ground sank under him the
closer bound he involuntarily became to the order when he had joined
the freemasons he had experienced the feeling of one who confidently
steps onto the smooth surface of a bog when he put his foot down it
sank in to make quite sure of the firmness of the ground he put his
other foot down and sank deeper still became stuck in it and
involuntarily waded kneedeep in the bog

joseph alexeevich was not in petersburghe had of late stood aside from
the affairs of the petersburg lodges and lived almost entirely in
moscow all the members of the lodges were men pierre knew in ordinary
life and it was difficult for him to regard them merely as brothers in
freemasonry and not as prince b or ivan vasílevich d whom he knew in
society mostly as weak and insignificant men under the masonic aprons
and insignia he saw the uniforms and decorations at which they aimed in
ordinary life often after collecting alms and reckoning up twenty to
thirty rubles received for the most part in promises from a dozen
members of whom half were as well able to pay as himself pierre
remembered the masonic vow in which each brother promised to devote all
his belongings to his neighbor and doubts on which he tried not to
dwell arose in his soul

he divided the brothers he knew into four categories in the first he
put those who did not take an active part in the affairs of the lodges
or in human affairs but were exclusively occupied with the mystical
science of the order with questions of the threefold designation of
god the three primordial elementssulphur mercury and saltor the
meaning of the square and all the various figures of the temple of
solomon pierre respected this class of brothers to which the elder ones
chiefly belonged including pierre thought joseph alexeevich himself
but he did not share their interests his heart was not in the mystical
aspect of freemasonry

in the second category pierre reckoned himself and others like him
seeking and vacillating who had not yet found in freemasonry a straight
and comprehensible path but hoped to do so

in the third category he included those brothers the majority who saw
nothing in freemasonry but the external forms and ceremonies and prized
the strict performance of these forms without troubling about their
purport or significance such were willarski and even the grand master
of the principal lodge

finally to the fourth category also a great many brothers belonged
particularly those who had lately joined these according to pierres
observations were men who had no belief in anything nor desire for
anything but joined the freemasons merely to associate with the wealthy
young brothers who were influential through their connections or rank
and of whom there were very many in the lodge

pierre began to feel dissatisfied with what he was doing freemasonry
at any rate as he saw it here sometimes seemed to him based merely on
externals he did not think of doubting freemasonry itself but
suspected that russian masonry had taken a wrong path and deviated from
its original principles and so toward the end of the year he went
abroad to be initiated into the higher secrets of the order

in the summer of  pierre returned to petersburg our freemasons knew
from correspondence with those abroad that bezúkhov had obtained the
confidence of many highly placed persons had been initiated into many
mysteries had been raised to a higher grade and was bringing back with
him much that might conduce to the advantage of the masonic cause in
russia the petersburg freemasons all came to see him tried to
ingratiate themselves with him and it seemed to them all that he was
preparing something for them and concealing it

a solemn meeting of the lodge of the second degree was convened at
which pierre promised to communicate to the petersburg brothers what he
had to deliver to them from the highest leaders of their order the
meeting was a full one after the usual ceremonies pierre rose and began
his address

dear brothers he began blushing and stammering with a written
speech in his hand it is not sufficient to observe our mysteries in
the seclusion of our lodgewe must actact we are drowsing but we must
act pierre raised his notebook and began to read

for the dissemination of pure truth and to secure the triumph of
virtue he read we must cleanse men from prejudice diffuse
principles in harmony with the spirit of the times undertake the
education of the young unite ourselves in indissoluble bonds with the
wisest men boldly yet prudently overcome superstitions infidelity and
folly and form of those devoted to us a body linked together by unity
of purpose and possessed of authority and power

to attain this end we must secure a preponderance of virtue over vice
and must endeavor to secure that the honest man may even in this world
receive a lasting reward for his virtue but in these great endeavors we
are gravely hampered by the political institutions of today what is to
be done in these circumstances to favor revolutions overthrow
everything repel force by force no we are very far from that
every violent reform deserves censure for it quite fails to remedy evil
while men remain what they are and also because wisdom needs no
violence

the whole plan of our order should be based on the idea of preparing
men of firmness and virtue bound together by unity of convictionaiming
at the punishment of vice and folly and patronizing talent and virtue
raising worthy men from the dust and attaching them to our brotherhood
only then will our order have the power unobtrusively to bind the hands
of the protectors of disorder and to control them without their being
aware of it in a word we must found a form of government holding
universal sway which should be diffused over the whole world without
destroying the bonds of citizenship and beside which all other
governments can continue in their customary course and do everything
except what impedes the great aim of our order which is to obtain for
virtue the victory over vice this aim was that of christianity itself
it taught men to be wise and good and for their own benefit to follow
the example and instruction of the best and wisest men

at that time when everything was plunged in darkness preaching alone
was of course sufficient the novelty of truth endowed her with special
strength but now we need much more powerful methods it is now
necessary that man governed by his senses should find in virtue a
charm palpable to those senses it is impossible to eradicate the
passions but we must strive to direct them to a noble aim and it is
therefore necessary that everyone should be able to satisfy his passions
within the limits of virtue our order should provide means to that end

as soon as we have a certain number of worthy men in every state each
of them again training two others and all being closely united
everything will be possible for our order which has already in secret
accomplished much for the welfare of mankind

this speech not only made a strong impression but created excitement in
the lodge the majority of the brothers seeing in it dangerous designs
of illuminism  met it with a coldness that surprised pierre the grand
master began answering him and pierre began developing his views with
more and more warmth it was long since there had been so stormy a
meeting parties were formed some accusing pierre of illuminism others
supporting him at that meeting he was struck for the first time by the
endless variety of mens minds which prevents a truth from ever
presenting itself identically to two persons even those members who
seemed to be on his side understood him in their own way with
limitations and alterations he could not agree to as what he always
wanted most was to convey his thought to others just as he himself
understood it

 the illuminati sought to substitute republican for monarchical
institutions

at the end of the meeting the grand master with irony and illwill
reproved bezúkhov for his vehemence and said it was not love of virtue
alone but also a love of strife that had moved him in the dispute
pierre did not answer him and asked briefly whether his proposal would
be accepted he was told that it would not and without waiting for the
usual formalities he left the lodge and went home





chapter viii

again pierre was overtaken by the depression he so dreaded for three
days after the delivery of his speech at the lodge he lay on a sofa at
home receiving no one and going nowhere

it was just then that he received a letter from his wife who implored
him to see her telling him how grieved she was about him and how she
wished to devote her whole life to him

at the end of the letter she informed him that in a few days she would
return to petersburg from abroad

following this letter one of the masonic brothers whom pierre respected
less than the others forced his way in to see him and turning the
conversation upon pierres matrimonial affairs by way of fraternal
advice expressed the opinion that his severity to his wife was wrong and
that he was neglecting one of the first rules of freemasonry by not
forgiving the penitent

at the same time his motherinlaw prince vasílis wife sent to him
imploring him to come if only for a few minutes to discuss a most
important matter pierre saw that there was a conspiracy against him and
that they wanted to reunite him with his wife and in the mood he then
was this was not even unpleasant to him nothing mattered to him
nothing in life seemed to him of much importance and under the
influence of the depression that possessed him he valued neither his
liberty nor his resolution to punish his wife

no one is right and no one is to blame so she too is not to blame he
thought

if he did not at once give his consent to a reunion with his wife it
was only because in his state of depression he did not feel able to take
any step had his wife come to him he would not have turned her away
compared to what preoccupied him was it not a matter of indifference
whether he lived with his wife or not

without replying either to his wife or his motherinlaw pierre late
one night prepared for a journey and started for moscow to see joseph
alexeevich this is what he noted in his diary

moscow th november

i have just returned from my benefactor and hasten to write down what i
have experienced joseph alexeevich is living poorly and has for three
years been suffering from a painful disease of the bladder no one has
ever heard him utter a groan or a word of complaint from morning till
late at night except when he eats his very plain food he is working at
science he received me graciously and made me sit down on the bed on
which he lay i made the sign of the knights of the east and of
jerusalem and he responded in the same manner asking me with a mild
smile what i had learned and gained in the prussian and scottish lodges
i told him everything as best i could and told him what i had proposed
to our petersburg lodge of the bad reception i had encountered and of
my rupture with the brothers joseph alexeevich having remained silent
and thoughtful for a good while told me his view of the matter which
at once lit up for me my whole past and the future path i should follow
he surprised me by asking whether i remembered the threefold aim of the
order  the preservation and study of the mystery  the
purification and reformation of oneself for its reception and  the
improvement of the human race by striving for such purification which
is the principal aim of these three certainly selfreformation and
selfpurification only to this aim can we always strive independently
of circumstances but at the same time just this aim demands the
greatest efforts of us and so led astray by pride losing sight of
this aim we occupy ourselves either with the mystery which in our
impurity we are unworthy to receive or seek the reformation of the
human race while ourselves setting an example of baseness and
profligacy illuminism is not a pure doctrine just because it is
attracted by social activity and puffed up by pride on this ground
joseph alexeevich condemned my speech and my whole activity and in the
depth of my soul i agreed with him talking of my family affairs he said
to me the chief duty of a true mason as i have told you lies in
perfecting himself we often think that by removing all the difficulties
of our life we shall more quickly reach our aim but on the contrary my
dear sir it is only in the midst of worldly cares that we can attain
our three chief aims  selfknowledgefor man can only know himself
by comparison  selfperfecting which can only be attained by
conflict and  the attainment of the chief virtuelove of death only
the vicissitudes of life can show us its vanity and develop our innate
love of death or of rebirth to a new life these words are all the more
remarkable because in spite of his great physical sufferings joseph
alexeevich is never weary of life though he loves death for whichin
spite of the purity and loftiness of his inner manhe does not yet feel
himself sufficiently prepared my benefactor then explained to me fully
the meaning of the great square of creation and pointed out to me that
the numbers three and seven are the basis of everything he advised me
not to avoid intercourse with the petersburg brothers but to take up
only secondgrade posts in the lodge to try while diverting the
brothers from pride to turn them toward the true path selfknowledge
and selfperfecting besides this he advised me for myself personally
above all to keep a watch over myself and to that end he gave me a
notebook the one i am now writing in and in which i will in future note
down all my actions

petersburg rd november

i am again living with my wife my motherinlaw came to me in tears and
said that hélène was here and that she implored me to hear her that she
was innocent and unhappy at my desertion and much more i knew that if
i once let myself see her i should not have strength to go on refusing
what she wanted in my perplexity i did not know whose aid and advice to
seek had my benefactor been here he would have told me what to do i
went to my room and reread joseph alexeevichs letters and recalled my
conversations with him and deduced from it all that i ought not to
refuse a supplicant and ought to reach a helping hand to
everyoneespecially to one so closely bound to meand that i must bear
my cross but if i forgive her for the sake of doing right then let
union with her have only a spiritual aim that is what i decided and
what i wrote to joseph alexeevich i told my wife that i begged her to
forget the past to forgive me whatever wrong i may have done her and
that i had nothing to forgive it gave me joy to tell her this she need
not know how hard it was for me to see her again i have settled on the
upper floor of this big house and am experiencing a happy feeling of
regeneration





chapter ix

at that time as always happens the highest society that met at court
and at the grand balls was divided into several circles each with its
own particular tone the largest of these was the french circle of the
napoleonic alliance the circle of count rumyántsev and caulaincourt in
this group hélène as soon as she had settled in petersburg with her
husband took a very prominent place she was visited by the members of
the french embassy and by many belonging to that circle and noted for
their intellect and polished manners

hélène had been at erfurt during the famous meeting of the emperors and
had brought from there these connections with the napoleonic
notabilities at erfurt her success had been brilliant napoleon himself
had noticed her in the theater and said of her cest un superbe
animal  her success as a beautiful and elegant woman did not surprise
pierre for she had become even handsomer than before what did surprise
him was that during these last two years his wife had succeeded in
gaining the reputation d une femme charmante aussi spirituelle que
belle  the distinguished prince de ligne wrote her eightpage
letters bilibin saved up his epigrams to produce them in countess
bezúkhovas presence to be received in the countess bezúkhovas salon
was regarded as a diploma of intellect young men read books before
attending hélènes evenings to have something to say in her salon and
secretaries of the embassy and even ambassadors confided diplomatic
secrets to her so that in a way hélène was a power pierre who knew
she was very stupid sometimes attended with a strange feeling of
perplexity and fear her evenings and dinner parties where politics
poetry and philosophy were discussed at these parties his feelings
were like those of a conjuror who always expects his trick to be found
out at any moment but whether because stupidity was just what was
needed to run such a salon or because those who were deceived found
pleasure in the deception at any rate it remained unexposed and hélène
bezúkhovas reputation as a lovely and clever woman became so firmly
established that she could say the emptiest and stupidest things and
everybody would go into raptures over every word of hers and look for a
profound meaning in it of which she herself had no conception

 thats a superb animal

  of a charming woman as witty as she is lovely

pierre was just the husband needed for a brilliant society woman he was
that absentminded crank a grand seigneur husband who was in no ones
way and far from spoiling the high tone and general impression of the
drawing room he served by the contrast he presented to her as an
advantageous background to his elegant and tactful wife pierre during
the last two years as a result of his continual absorption in abstract
interests and his sincere contempt for all else had acquired in his
wifes circle which did not interest him that air of unconcern
indifference and benevolence toward all which cannot be acquired
artificially and therefore inspires involuntary respect he entered his
wifes drawing room as one enters a theater was acquainted with
everybody equally pleased to see everyone and equally indifferent to
them all sometimes he joined in a conversation which interested him
and regardless of whether any gentlemen of the embassy were present
or not lispingly expressed his views which were sometimes not at all
in accord with the accepted tone of the moment but the general opinion
concerning the queer husband of the most distinguished woman in
petersburg was so well established that no one took his freaks
seriously

among the many young men who frequented her house every day borís
drubetskóy who had already achieved great success in the service was
the most intimate friend of the bezúkhov household since hélènes return
from erfurt hélène spoke of him as mon page and treated him like a
child her smile for him was the same as for everybody but sometimes
that smile made pierre uncomfortable toward him borís behaved with a
particularly dignified and sad deference this shade of deference also
disturbed pierre he had suffered so painfully three years before from
the mortification to which his wife had subjected him that he now
protected himself from the danger of its repetition first by not being
a husband to his wife and secondly by not allowing himself to suspect

no now that she has become a bluestocking she has finally renounced
her former infatuations he told himself there has never been an
instance of a bluestocking being carried away by affairs of the hearta
statement which though gathered from an unknown source he believed
implicitly yet strange to say borís presence in his wifes drawing
room and he was almost always there had a physical effect upon pierre
it constricted his limbs and destroyed the unconsciousness and freedom
of his movements

what a strange antipathy thought pierre yet i used to like him very
much

in the eyes of the world pierre was a great gentleman the rather blind
and absurd husband of a distinguished wife a clever crank who did
nothing but harmed nobody and was a firstrate goodnatured fellow but
a complex and difficult process of internal development was taking place
all this time in pierres soul revealing much to him and causing him
many spiritual doubts and joys





chapter x

pierre went on with his diary and this is what he wrote in it during
that time

th november

got up at eight read the scriptures then went to my duties by joseph
alexeevichs advice pierre had entered the service of the state and
served on one of the committees returned home for dinner and dined
alonethe countess had many visitors i do not like i ate and drank
moderately and after dinner copied out some passages for the brothers
in the evening i went down to the countess and told a funny story about
b and only remembered that i ought not to have done so when everybody
laughed loudly at it

i am going to bed with a happy and tranquil mind great god help me to
walk in thy paths  to conquer anger by calmness and deliberation
 to vanquish lust by selfrestraint and repulsion  to withdraw
from worldliness but not avoid a the service of the state b family
duties c relations with my friends and the management of my affairs

th november

i got up late on waking i lay long in bed yielding to sloth o god
help and strengthen me that i may walk in thy ways read the scriptures
but without proper feeling brother urusov came and we talked about
worldly vanities he told me of the emperors new projects i began to
criticize them but remembered my rules and my benefactors wordsthat a
true freemason should be a zealous worker for the state when his aid is
required and a quiet onlooker when not called on to assist my tongue is
my enemy brothers g v and o visited me and we had a preliminary talk
about the reception of a new brother they laid on me the duty of
rhetor i feel myself weak and unworthy then our talk turned to the
interpretation of the seven pillars and steps of the temple the seven
sciences the seven virtues the seven vices and the seven gifts of the
holy spirit brother o was very eloquent in the evening the admission
took place the new decoration of the premises contributed much to the
magnificence of the spectacle it was borís drubetskóy who was admitted
i nominated him and was the rhetor a strange feeling agitated me all
the time i was alone with him in the dark chamber i caught myself
harboring a feeling of hatred toward him which i vainly tried to
overcome that is why i should really like to save him from evil and
lead him into the path of truth but evil thoughts of him did not leave
me it seemed to me that his object in entering the brotherhood was
merely to be intimate and in favor with members of our lodge apart from
the fact that he had asked me several times whether n and s were
members of our lodge a question to which i could not reply and that
according to my observation he is incapable of feeling respect for our
holy order and is too preoccupied and satisfied with the outer man to
desire spiritual improvement i had no cause to doubt him but he seemed
to me insincere and all the time i stood alone with him in the dark
temple it seemed to me that he was smiling contemptuously at my words
and i wished really to stab his bare breast with the sword i held to it
i could not be eloquent nor could i frankly mention my doubts to the
brothers and to the grand master great architect of nature help me to
find the true path out of the labyrinth of lies

after this three pages were left blank in the diary and then the
following was written

i have had a long and instructive talk alone with brother v who
advised me to hold fast by brother a though i am unworthy much was
revealed to me adonai is the name of the creator of the world elohim
is the name of the ruler of all the third name is the name unutterable
which means the all talks with brother v strengthen refresh and
support me in the path of virtue in his presence doubt has no place
the distinction between the poor teachings of mundane science and our
sacred allembracing teaching is clear to me human sciences dissect
everything to comprehend it and kill everything to examine it in the
holy science of our order all is one all is known in its entirety and
life the trinitythe three elements of matterare sulphur mercury and
salt sulphur is of an oily and fiery nature in combination with salt
by its fiery nature it arouses a desire in the latter by means of which
it attracts mercury seizes it holds it and in combination produces
other bodies mercury is a fluid volatile spiritual essence christ
the holy spirit him

rd december

awoke late read the scriptures but was apathetic afterwards went and
paced up and down the large hall i wished to meditate but instead my
imagination pictured an occurrence of four years ago when dólokhov
meeting me in moscow after our duel said he hoped i was enjoying
perfect peace of mind in spite of my wifes absence at the time i gave
him no answer now i recalled every detail of that meeting and in my
mind gave him the most malevolent and bitter replies i recollected
myself and drove away that thought only when i found myself glowing with
anger but i did not sufficiently repent afterwards borís drubetskóy
came and began relating various adventures his coming vexed me from the
first and i said something disagreeable to him he replied i flared up
and said much that was unpleasant and even rude to him he became
silent and i recollected myself only when it was too late my god i
cannot get on with him at all the cause of this is my egotism i set
myself above him and so become much worse than he for he is lenient to
my rudeness while i on the contrary nourish contempt for him o god
grant that in his presence i may rather see my own vileness and behave
so that he too may benefit after dinner i fell asleep and as i was
drowsing off i clearly heard a voice saying in my left ear thy day

i dreamed that i was walking in the dark and was suddenly surrounded by
dogs but i went on undismayed suddenly a smallish dog seized my left
thigh with its teeth and would not let go i began to throttle it with
my hands scarcely had i torn it off before another a bigger one began
biting me i lifted it up but the higher i lifted it the bigger and
heavier it grew and suddenly brother a came and taking my arm led me
to a building to enter which we had to pass along a narrow plank i
stepped on it but it bent and gave way and i began to clamber up a
fence which i could scarcely reach with my hands after much effort i
dragged myself up so that my leg hung down on one side and my body on
the other i looked round and saw brother a standing on the fence and
pointing me to a broad avenue and garden and in the garden was a large
and beautiful building i woke up o lord great architect of nature
help me to tear from myself these dogsmy passions especially the last
which unites in itself the strength of all the former ones and aid me
to enter that temple of virtue to a vision of which i attained in my
dream

th december

i dreamed that joseph alexeevich was sitting in my house and that i was
very glad and wished to entertain him it seemed as if i chattered
incessantly with other people and suddenly remembered that this could
not please him and i wished to come close to him and embrace him but
as soon as i drew near i saw that his face had changed and grown young
and he was quietly telling me something about the teaching of our order
but so softly that i could not hear it then it seemed that we all left
the room and something strange happened we were sitting or lying on the
floor he was telling me something and i wished to show him my
sensibility and not listening to what he was saying i began picturing
to myself the condition of my inner man and the grace of god sanctifying
me and tears came into my eyes and i was glad he noticed this but he
looked at me with vexation and jumped up breaking off his remarks i
felt abashed and asked whether what he had been saying did not concern
me but he did not reply gave me a kind look and then we suddenly
found ourselves in my bedroom where there is a double bed he lay down
on the edge of it and i burned with longing to caress him and lie down
too and he said tell me frankly what is your chief temptation do you
know it i think you know it already abashed by this question i
replied that sloth was my chief temptation he shook his head
incredulously and even more abashed i said that though i was living
with my wife as he advised i was not living with her as her husband to
this he replied that one should not deprive a wife of ones embraces and
gave me to understand that that was my duty but i replied that i should
be ashamed to do it and suddenly everything vanished and i awoke and
found in my mind the text from the gospel the life was the light of
men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it
not joseph alexeevichs face had looked young and bright that day i
received a letter from my benefactor in which he wrote about conjugal
duties

th december

i had a dream from which i awoke with a throbbing heart i saw that i
was in moscow in my house in the big sitting room and joseph
alexeevich came in from the drawing room i seemed to know at once that
the process of regeneration had already taken place in him and i rushed
to meet him i embraced him and kissed his hands and he said hast
thou noticed that my face is different i looked at him still holding
him in my arms and saw that his face was young but that he had no hair
on his head and his features were quite changed and i said i should
have known you had i met you by chance and i thought to myself am i
telling the truth and suddenly i saw him lying like a dead body then
he gradually recovered and went with me into my study carrying a large
book of sheets of drawing paper i said i drew that and he answered
by bowing his head i opened the book and on all the pages there were
excellent drawings and in my dream i knew that these drawings
represented the love adventures of the soul with its beloved and on its
pages i saw a beautiful representation of a maiden in transparent
garments and with a transparent body flying up to the clouds and i
seemed to know that this maiden was nothing else than a representation
of the song of songs and looking at those drawings i dreamed i felt
that i was doing wrong but could not tear myself away from them lord
help me my god if thy forsaking me is thy doing thy will be done but
if i am myself the cause teach me what i should do i shall perish of
my debauchery if thou utterly desertest me





chapter xi

the rostóvs monetary affairs had not improved during the two years they
had spent in the country

though nicholas rostóv had kept firmly to his resolution and was still
serving modestly in an obscure regiment spending comparatively little
the way of life at otradnoemitenkas management of affairs in
particularwas such that the debts inevitably increased every year the
only resource obviously presenting itself to the old count was to apply
for an official post so he had come to petersburg to look for one and
also as he said to let the lassies enjoy themselves for the last time

soon after their arrival in petersburg berg proposed to véra and was
accepted

though in moscow the rostóvs belonged to the best society without
themselves giving it a thought yet in petersburg their circle of
acquaintances was a mixed and indefinite one in petersburg they were
provincials and the very people they had entertained in moscow without
inquiring to what set they belonged here looked down on them

the rostóvs lived in the same hospitable way in petersburg as in moscow
and the most diverse people met at their suppers country neighbors from
otradnoe impoverished old squires and their daughters peronskaya a
maid of honor pierre bezúkhov and the son of their district postmaster
who had obtained a post in petersburg among the men who very soon
became frequent visitors at the rostóvs house in petersburg were borís
pierre whom the count had met in the street and dragged home with him
and berg who spent whole days at the rostóvs and paid the eldest
daughter countess véra the attentions a young man pays when he intends
to propose

not in vain had berg shown everybody his right hand wounded at
austerlitz and held a perfectly unnecessary sword in his left he
narrated that episode so persistently and with so important an air that
everyone believed in the merit and usefulness of his deed and he had
obtained two decorations for austerlitz

in the finnish war he also managed to distinguish himself he had picked
up the scrap of a grenade that had killed an aidedecamp standing near
the commanderinchief and had taken it to his commander just as he had
done after austerlitz he related this occurrence at such length and so
insistently that everyone again believed it had been necessary to do
this and he received two decorations for the finnish war also in
he was a captain in the guards wore medals and held some special
lucrative posts in petersburg

though some skeptics smiled when told of bergs merits it could not be
denied that he was a painstaking and brave officer on excellent terms
with his superiors and a moral young man with a brilliant career before
him and an assured position in society

four years before meeting a german comrade in the stalls of a moscow
theater berg had pointed out véra rostóva to him and had said in
german das soll mein weib werden  and from that moment had made up
his mind to marry her now in petersburg having considered the rostóvs
position and his own he decided that the time had come to propose

 that girl shall be my wife

bergs proposal was at first received with a perplexity that was not
flattering to him at first it seemed strange that the son of an obscure
livonian gentleman should propose marriage to a countess rostóva but
bergs chief characteristic was such a naïve and good natured egotism
that the rostóvs involuntarily came to think it would be a good thing
since he himself was so firmly convinced that it was good indeed
excellent moreover the rostóvs affairs were seriously embarrassed as
the suitor could not but know and above all véra was twentyfour had
been taken out everywhere and though she was certainly goodlooking and
sensible no one up to now had proposed to her so they gave their
consent

you see said berg to his comrade whom he called friend only
because he knew that everyone has friends you see i have considered
it all and should not marry if i had not thought it all out or if it
were in any way unsuitable but on the contrary my papa and mamma are
now provided fori have arranged that rent for them in the baltic
provincesand i can live in petersburg on my pay and with her fortune
and my good management we can get along nicely i am not marrying for
moneyi consider that dishonorablebut a wife should bring her share and
a husband his i have my position in the service she has connections
and some means in our times that is worth something isnt it but
above all she is a handsome estimable girl and she loves me

berg blushed and smiled

and i love her because her character is sensible and very good now
the other sister though they are the same family is quite differentan
unpleasant character and has not the same intelligence she is so you
know unpleasant but my fiancee well you will be coming he
was going to say to dine but changed his mind and said to take tea
with us and quickly doubling up his tongue he blew a small round ring
of tobacco smoke perfectly embodying his dream of happiness

after the first feeling of perplexity aroused in the parents by bergs
proposal the holiday tone of joyousness usual at such times took
possession of the family but the rejoicing was external and insincere
in the familys feeling toward this wedding a certain awkwardness and
constraint was evident as if they were ashamed of not having loved véra
sufficiently and of being so ready to get her off their hands the old
count felt this most he would probably have been unable to state the
cause of his embarrassment but it resulted from the state of his
affairs he did not know at all how much he had what his debts amounted
to or what dowry he could give véra when his daughters were born he
had assigned to each of them for her dowry an estate with three
hundred serfs but one of these estates had already been sold and the
other was mortgaged and the interest so much in arrears that it would
have to be sold so that it was impossible to give it to véra nor had
he any money

berg had already been engaged a month and only a week remained before
the wedding but the count had not yet decided in his own mind the
question of the dowry nor spoken to his wife about it at one time the
count thought of giving her the ryazan estate or of selling a forest at
another time of borrowing money on a note of hand a few days before the
wedding berg entered the counts study early one morning and with a
pleasant smile respectfully asked his future fatherinlaw to let him
know what véras dowry would be the count was so disconcerted by this
longforeseen inquiry that without consideration he gave the first reply
that came into his head i like your being businesslike about it i
like it you shall be satisfied

and patting berg on the shoulder he got up wishing to end the
conversation but berg smiling pleasantly explained that if he did not
know for certain how much véra would have and did not receive at least
part of the dowry in advance he would have to break matters off

because consider countif i allowed myself to marry now without
having definite means to maintain my wife i should be acting badly

the conversation ended by the count who wished to be generous and to
avoid further importunity saying that he would give a note of hand for
eighty thousand rubles berg smiled meekly kissed the count on the
shoulder and said that he was very grateful but that it was impossible
for him to arrange his new life without receiving thirty thousand in
ready money or at least twenty thousand count he added and then a
note of hand for only sixty thousand

yes yes all right said the count hurriedly only excuse me my
dear fellow ill give you twenty thousand and a note of hand for eighty
thousand as well yes yes kiss me





chapter xii

natásha was sixteen and it was the year  the very year to which she
had counted on her fingers with borís after they had kissed four years
ago since then she had not seen him before sónya and her mother if
borís happened to be mentioned she spoke quite freely of that episode
as of some childish longforgotten matter that was not worth
mentioning but in the secret depths of her soul the question whether
her engagement to borís was a jest or an important binding promise
tormented her

since borís left moscow in  to join the army he had not seen the
rostóvs he had been in moscow several times and had passed near
otradnoe but had never been to see them

sometimes it occurred to natásha that he did not wish to see her and
this conjecture was confirmed by the sad tone in which her elders spoke
of him

nowadays old friends are not remembered the countess would say when
borís was mentioned

anna mikháylovna also had of late visited them less frequently seemed
to hold herself with particular dignity and always spoke rapturously
and gratefully of the merits of her son and the brilliant career on
which he had entered when the rostóvs came to petersburg borís called
on them

he drove to their house in some agitation the memory of natásha was his
most poetic recollection but he went with the firm intention of letting
her and her parents feel that the childish relations between himself and
natásha could not be binding either on her or on him he had a brilliant
position in society thanks to his intimacy with countess bezúkhova a
brilliant position in the service thanks to the patronage of an
important personage whose complete confidence he enjoyed and he was
beginning to make plans for marrying one of the richest heiresses in
petersburg plans which might very easily be realized when he entered
the rostóvs drawing room natásha was in her own room when she heard of
his arrival she almost ran into the drawing room flushed and beaming
with a more than cordial smile

borís remembered natásha in a short dress with dark eyes shining from
under her curls and boisterous childish laughter as he had known her
four years before and so he was taken aback when quite a different
natásha entered and his face expressed rapturous astonishment this
expression on his face pleased natásha

well do you recognize your little madcap playmate asked the
countess

borís kissed natáshas hand and said that he was astonished at the
change in her

how handsome you have grown

i should think so replied natáshas laughing eyes

and is papa older she asked

natásha sat down and without joining in borís conversation with the
countess silently and minutely studied her childhoods suitor he felt
the weight of that resolute and affectionate scrutiny and glanced at her
occasionally

borís uniform spurs tie and the way his hair was brushed were all
comme il faut and in the latest fashion this natásha noticed at once
he sat rather sideways in the armchair next to the countess arranging
with his right hand the cleanest of gloves that fitted his left hand
like a skin and he spoke with a particularly refined compression of his
lips about the amusements of the highest petersburg society recalling
with mild irony old times in moscow and moscow acquaintances it was not
accidentally natásha felt that he alluded when speaking of the
highest aristocracy to an ambassadors ball he had attended and to
invitations he had received from nn and ss

all this time natásha sat silent glancing up at him from under her
brows this gaze disturbed and confused borís more and more he looked
round more frequently toward her and broke off in what he was saying
he did not stay more than ten minutes then rose and took his leave the
same inquisitive challenging and rather mocking eyes still looked at
him after his first visit borís said to himself that natásha attracted
him just as much as ever but that he must not yield to that feeling
because to marry her a girl almost without fortune would mean ruin to
his career while to renew their former relations without intending to
marry her would be dishonorable borís made up his mind to avoid meeting
natásha but despite that resolution he called again a few days later
and began calling often and spending whole days at the rostóvs it
seemed to him that he ought to have an explanation with natásha and tell
her that the old times must be forgotten that in spite of everything
she could not be his wife that he had no means and they would never
let her marry him but he failed to do so and felt awkward about
entering on such an explanation from day to day he became more and more
entangled it seemed to her mother and sónya that natásha was in love
with borís as of old she sang him his favorite songs showed him her
album making him write in it did not allow him to allude to the past
letting it be understood how delightful was the present and every day
he went away in a fog without having said what he meant to and not
knowing what he was doing or why he came or how it would all end he
left off visiting hélène and received reproachful notes from her every
day and yet he continued to spend whole days with the rostóvs





chapter xiii

one night when the old countess in nightcap and dressing jacket
without her false curls and with her poor little knob of hair showing
under her white cotton cap knelt sighing and groaning on a rug and
bowing to the ground in prayer her door creaked and natásha also in a
dressing jacket with slippers on her bare feet and her hair in
curlpapers ran in the countessher prayerful mood dispelledlooked
round and frowned she was finishing her last prayer can it be that
this couch will be my grave natásha flushed and eager seeing her
mother in prayer suddenly checked her rush half sat down and
unconsciously put out her tongue as if chiding herself seeing that her
mother was still praying she ran on tiptoe to the bed and rapidly
slipping one little foot against the other pushed off her slippers and
jumped onto the bed the countess had feared might become her grave this
couch was high with a feather bed and five pillows each smaller than
the one below natásha jumped on it sank into the feather bed rolled
over to the wall and began snuggling up the bedclothes as she settled
down raising her knees to her chin kicking out and laughing almost
inaudibly now covering herself up head and all and now peeping at her
mother the countess finished her prayers and came to the bed with a
stern face but seeing that natáshas head was covered she smiled in
her kind weak way

now then now then said she

mamma can we have a talk yes said natásha now just one on your
throat and another thatll do and seizing her mother round the
neck she kissed her on the throat in her behavior to her mother
natásha seemed rough but she was so sensitive and tactful that however
she clasped her mother she always managed to do it without hurting her
or making her feel uncomfortable or displeased

well what is it tonight said the mother having arranged her pillows
and waited until natásha after turning over a couple of times had
settled down beside her under the quilt spread out her arms and
assumed a serious expression

these visits of natáshas at night before the count returned from his
club were one of the greatest pleasures of both mother and daughter

what is it tonightbut i have to tell you

natásha put her hand on her mothers mouth

about borís i know she said seriously thats what i have come
about dont say iti know no do tell me and she removed her hand
tell me mamma hes nice

natásha you are sixteen at your age i was married you say borís is
nice he is very nice and i love him like a son but what then what
are you thinking about you have quite turned his head i can see
that

as she said this the countess looked round at her daughter natásha was
lying looking steadily straight before her at one of the mahogany
sphinxes carved on the corners of the bedstead so that the countess
only saw her daughters face in profile that face struck her by its
peculiarly serious and concentrated expression

natásha was listening and considering

well what then said she

you have quite turned his head and why what do you want of him you
know you cant marry him

why not said natásha without changing her position

because he is young because he is poor because he is a relation
and because you yourself dont love him

how do you know

i know it is not right darling

but if i want to said natásha

leave off talking nonsense said the countess

but if i want to

natásha i am in earnest

natásha did not let her finish she drew the countess large hand to
her kissed it on the back and then on the palm then again turned it
over and began kissing first one knuckle then the space between the
knuckles then the next knuckle whispering january february march
april may speak mamma why dont you say anything speak said she
turning to her mother who was tenderly gazing at her daughter and in
that contemplation seemed to have forgotten all she had wished to say

it wont do my love not everyone will understand this friendship
dating from your childish days and to see him so intimate with you may
injure you in the eyes of other young men who visit us and above all it
torments him for nothing he may already have found a suitable and
wealthy match and now hes half crazy

crazy repeated natásha

ill tell you some things about myself i had a cousin

i know cyril matveich but he is old

he was not always old but this is what ill do natásha ill have a
talk with borís he need not come so often

why not if he likes to

because i know it will end in nothing

how can you know no mamma dont speak to him what nonsense said
natásha in the tone of one being deprived of her property well i
wont marry but let him come if he enjoys it and i enjoy it natásha
smiled and looked at her mother not to marry but just so she added

how so my pet

just so theres no need for me to marry him but just so

just so just so repeated the countess and shaking all over she
went off into a good humored unexpected elderly laugh

dont laugh stop cried natásha youre shaking the whole bed
youre awfully like me just such another giggler wait and she
seized the countess hands and kissed a knuckle of the little finger
saying june and continued kissing july august on the other
hand but mamma is he very much in love what do you think was
anybody ever so much in love with you and hes very nice very very
nice only not quite my tastehe is so narrow like the diningroom
clock dont you understand narrow you knowgray light gray

natásha continued dont you really understand nicholas would
understand bezúkhov now is blue darkblue and red and he is
square

no he is a freemason i have found out he is fine darkblue and
red how can i explain it to you

little countess the counts voice called from behind the door
youre not asleep natásha jumped up snatched up her slippers and
ran barefoot to her own room

it was a long time before she could sleep she kept thinking that no one
could understand all that she understood and all there was in her

sónya she thought glancing at that curledup sleeping little kitten
with her enormous plait of hair no how could she shes virtuous she
fell in love with nicholas and does not wish to know anything more even
mamma does not understand it is wonderful how clever i am and how
charming she is she went on speaking of herself in the third person
and imagining it was some very wise manthe wisest and best of menwho
was saying it of her there is everything everything in her
continued this man she is unusually intelligent charming and then
she is pretty uncommonly pretty and agileshe swims and rides
splendidly and her voice one can really say its a wonderful voice

she hummed a scrap from her favorite opera by cherubini threw herself
on her bed laughed at the pleasant thought that she would immediately
fall asleep called dunyasha the maid to put out the candle and before
dunyasha had left the room had already passed into yet another happier
world of dreams where everything was as light and beautiful as in
reality and even more so because it was different

next day the countess called borís aside and had a talk with him after
which he ceased coming to the rostóvs





chapter xiv

on the thirtyfirst of december new years eve    an old
grandee of catherines day was giving a ball and midnight supper the
diplomatic corps and the emperor himself were to be present

the grandees wellknown mansion on the english quay glittered with
innumerable lights police were stationed at the brightly lit entrance
which was carpeted with red baize and not only gendarmes but dozens of
police officers and even the police master himself stood at the porch
carriages kept driving away and fresh ones arriving with redliveried
footmen and footmen in plumed hats from the carriages emerged men
wearing uniforms stars and ribbons while ladies in satin and ermine
cautiously descended the carriage steps which were let down for them
with a clatter and then walked hurriedly and noiselessly over the baize
at the entrance

almost every time a new carriage drove up a whisper ran through the
crowd and caps were doffed

the emperor no a minister prince ambassador dont you see
the plumes was whispered among the crowd

one person better dressed than the rest seemed to know everyone and
mentioned by name the greatest dignitaries of the day

a third of the visitors had already arrived but the rostóvs who were
to be present were still hurrying to get dressed

there had been many discussions and preparations for this ball in the
rostóv family many fears that the invitation would not arrive that the
dresses would not be ready or that something would not be arranged as
it should be

márya ignatevna peronskaya a thin and shallow maid of honor at the
court of the dowager empress who was a friend and relation of the
countess and piloted the provincial rostóvs in petersburg high society
was to accompany them to the ball

they were to call for her at her house in the taurida gardens at ten
oclock but it was already five minutes to ten and the girls were not
yet dressed

natásha was going to her first grand ball she had got up at eight that
morning and had been in a fever of excitement and activity all day all
her powers since morning had been concentrated on ensuring that they
allshe herself mamma and sónyashould be as well dressed as possible
sónya and her mother put themselves entirely in her hands the countess
was to wear a claretcolored velvet dress and the two girls white gauze
over pink silk slips with roses on their bodices and their hair dressed
a la grecque

everything essential had already been done feet hands necks and ears
washed perfumed and powdered as befits a ball the openwork silk
stockings and white satin shoes with ribbons were already on the
hairdressing was almost done sónya was finishing dressing and so was
the countess but natásha who had bustled about helping them all was
behindhand she was still sitting before a lookingglass with a dressing
jacket thrown over her slender shoulders sónya stood ready dressed in
the middle of the room and pressing the head of a pin till it hurt her
dainty finger was fixing on a last ribbon that squeaked as the pin went
through it

thats not the way thats not the way sónya cried natásha turning
her head and clutching with both hands at her hair which the maid who
was dressing it had not time to release that bow is not right come
here

sónya sat down and natásha pinned the ribbon on differently

allow me miss i cant do it like that said the maid who was holding
natáshas hair

oh dear well then wait thats right sónya

arent you ready it is nearly ten came the countess voice

directly directly and you mamma

i have only my cap to pin on

dont do it without me called natásha you wont do it right

but its already ten

they had decided to be at the ball by half past ten and natásha had
still to get dressed and they had to call at the taurida gardens

when her hair was done natásha in her short petticoat from under which
her dancing shoes showed and in her mothers dressing jacket ran up to
sónya scrutinized her and then ran to her mother turning her mothers
head this way and that she fastened on the cap and hurriedly kissing
her gray hair ran back to the maids who were turning up the hem of her
skirt

the cause of the delay was natáshas skirt which was too long two
maids were turning up the hem and hurriedly biting off the ends of
thread a third with pins in her mouth was running about between the
countess and sónya and a fourth held the whole of the gossamer garment
up high on one uplifted hand

mavra quicker darling

give me my thimble miss from there

whenever will you be ready asked the count coming to the door here
is some scent peronskaya must be tired of waiting

its ready miss said the maid holding up the shortened gauze dress
with two fingers and blowing and shaking something off it as if by
this to express a consciousness of the airiness and purity of what she
held

natásha began putting on the dress

in a minute in a minute dont come in papa she cried to her father
as he opened the doorspeaking from under the filmy skirt which still
covered her whole face

sónya slammed the door to a minute later they let the count in he was
wearing a blue swallowtail coat shoes and stockings and was perfumed
and his hair pomaded

oh papa how nice you look charming cried natásha as she stood in
the middle of the room smoothing out the folds of the gauze

if you please miss allow me said the maid who on her knees was
pulling the skirt straight and shifting the pins from one side of her
mouth to the other with her tongue

say what you like exclaimed sónya in a despairing voice as she
looked at natásha say what you like its still too long

natásha stepped back to look at herself in the pier glass the dress was
too long

really madam it is not at all too long said mavra crawling on her
knees after her young lady

well if its too long well tack it up well tack it up in one
minute said the resolute dunyasha taking a needle that was stuck on
the front of her little shawl and still kneeling on the floor set to
work once more

at that moment with soft steps the countess came in shyly in her cap
and velvet gown

oooo my beauty exclaimed the count she looks better than any of
you

he would have embraced her but blushing she stepped aside fearing to
be rumpled

mamma your cap more to this side said natásha ill arrange it
and she rushed forward so that the maids who were tacking up her skirt
could not move fast enough and a piece of gauze was torn off

oh goodness what has happened really it was not my fault

never mind ill run it up it wont show said dunyasha

what a beautya very queen said the nurse as she came to the door
and sónya they are lovely

at a quarter past ten they at last got into their carriages and started
but they had still to call at the taurida gardens

peronskaya was quite ready in spite of her age and plainness she had
gone through the same process as the rostóvs but with less flurryfor
to her it was a matter of routine her ugly old body was washed
perfumed and powdered in just the same way she had washed behind her
ears just as carefully and when she entered her drawing room in her
yellow dress wearing her badge as maid of honor her old ladys maid
was as full of rapturous admiration as the rostóvs servants had been

she praised the rostóvs toilets they praised her taste and toilet and
at eleven oclock careful of their coiffures and dresses they settled
themselves in their carriages and drove off





chapter xv

natásha had not had a moment free since early morning and had not once
had time to think of what lay before her

in the damp chill air and crowded closeness of the swaying carriage she
for the first time vividly imagined what was in store for her there at
the ball in those brightly lighted roomswith music flowers dances
the emperor and all the brilliant young people of petersburg the
prospect was so splendid that she hardly believed it would come true so
out of keeping was it with the chill darkness and closeness of the
carriage she understood all that awaited her only when after stepping
over the red baize at the entrance she entered the hall took off her
fur cloak and beside sónya and in front of her mother mounted the
brightly illuminated stairs between the flowers only then did she
remember how she must behave at a ball and tried to assume the majestic
air she considered indispensable for a girl on such an occasion but
fortunately for her she felt her eyes growing misty she saw nothing
clearly her pulse beat a hundred to the minute and the blood throbbed
at her heart she could not assume that pose which would have made her
ridiculous and she moved on almost fainting from excitement and trying
with all her might to conceal it and this was the very attitude that
became her best before and behind them other visitors were entering
also talking in low tones and wearing ball dresses the mirrors on the
landing reflected ladies in white paleblue and pink dresses with
diamonds and pearls on their bare necks and arms

natásha looked in the mirrors and could not distinguish her reflection
from the others all was blended into one brilliant procession on
entering the ballroom the regular hum of voices footsteps and
greetings deafened natásha and the light and glitter dazzled her still
more the host and hostess who had already been standing at the door
for half an hour repeating the same words to the various arrivals
charme de vous voir  greeted the rostóvs and peronskaya in the same
manner

 delighted to see you

the two girls in their white dresses each with a rose in her black
hair both curtsied in the same way but the hostess eye involuntarily
rested longer on the slim natásha she looked at her and gave her alone
a special smile in addition to her usual smile as hostess looking at
her she may have recalled the golden irrecoverable days of her own
girlhood and her own first ball the host also followed natásha with his
eyes and asked the count which was his daughter

charming said he kissing the tips of his fingers

in the ballroom guests stood crowding at the entrance doors awaiting the
emperor the countess took up a position in one of the front rows of
that crowd natásha heard and felt that several people were asking about
her and looking at her she realized that those noticing her liked her
and this observation helped to calm her

there are some like ourselves and some worse she thought

peronskaya was pointing out to the countess the most important people at
the ball

that is the dutch ambassador do you see that grayhaired man she
said indicating an old man with a profusion of silvergray curly hair
who was surrounded by ladies laughing at something he said

ah here she is the queen of petersburg countess bezúkhova said
peronskaya indicating hélène who had just entered how lovely she is
quite equal to márya antonovna see how the men young and old pay
court to her beautiful and clever they say princeis quite mad about
her but see those two though not goodlooking are even more run
after

she pointed to a lady who was crossing the room followed by a very plain
daughter

she is a splendid match a millionairess said peronskaya and look
here come her suitors

that is bezúkhovas brother anatole kurágin she said indicating a
handsome officer of the horse guards who passed by them with head erect
looking at something over the heads of the ladies hes handsome isnt
he i hear they will marry him to that rich girl but your cousin
drubetskóy is also very attentive to her they say she has millions oh
yes thats the french ambassador himself she replied to the countess
inquiry about caulaincourt looks as if he were a king all the same
the french are charming very charming no one more charming in society
ah here she is yes she is still the most beautiful of them all our
márya antonovna and how simply she is dressed lovely and that stout
one in spectacles is the universal freemason she went on indicating
pierre put him beside his wife and he looks a regular buffoon

pierre swaying his stout body advanced making way through the crowd
and nodding to right and left as casually and goodnaturedly as if he
were passing through a crowd at a fair he pushed through evidently
looking for someone

natásha looked joyfully at the familiar face of pierre the buffoon
as peronskaya had called him and knew he was looking for them and for
her in particular he had promised to be at the ball and introduce
partners to her

but before he reached them pierre stopped beside a very handsome dark
man of middle height and in a white uniform who stood by a window
talking to a tall man wearing stars and a ribbon natásha at once
recognized the shorter and younger man in the white uniform it was
bolkónski who seemed to her to have grown much younger happier and
betterlooking

theres someone else we knowbolkónski do you see mamma said
natásha pointing out prince andrew you remember he stayed a night
with us at otradnoe

oh you know him said peronskaya i cant bear him il fait a
present la pluie et le beau temps  hes too proud for anything takes
after his father and hes hand in glove with speranski writing some
project or other just look how he treats the ladies theres one
talking to him and he has turned away she said pointing at him id
give it to him if he treated me as he does those ladies

 he is all the rage just now





chapter xvi

suddenly everybody stirred began talking and pressed forward and then
back and between the two rows which separated the emperor entered to
the sounds of music that had immediately struck up behind him walked
his host and hostess he walked in rapidly bowing to right and left as
if anxious to get the first moments of the reception over the band
played the polonaise in vogue at that time on account of the words that
had been set to it beginning alexander elisaveta all our hearts you
ravish quite the emperor passed on to the drawing room the crowd
made a rush for the doors and several persons with excited faces
hurried there and back again then the crowd hastily retired from the
drawing room door at which the emperor reappeared talking to the
hostess a young man looking distraught pounced down on the ladies
asking them to move aside some ladies with faces betraying complete
forgetfulness of all the rules of decorum pushed forward to the
detriment of their toilets the men began to choose partners and take
their places for the polonaise

everyone moved back and the emperor came smiling out of the drawing
room leading his hostess by the hand but not keeping time to the music
the host followed with márya antonovna naryshkina then came
ambassadors ministers and various generals whom peronskaya diligently
named more than half the ladies already had partners and were taking
up or preparing to take up their positions for the polonaise natásha
felt that she would be left with her mother and sónya among a minority
of women who crowded near the wall not having been invited to dance
she stood with her slender arms hanging down her scarcely defined bosom
rising and falling regularly and with bated breath and glittering
frightened eyes gazed straight before her evidently prepared for the
height of joy or misery she was not concerned about the emperor or any
of those great people whom peronskaya was pointing outshe had but one
thought is it possible no one will ask me that i shall not be among
the first to dance is it possible that not one of all these men will
notice me they do not even seem to see me or if they do they look as
if they were saying ah shes not the one im after so its not worth
looking at her no its impossible she thought they must know how
i long to dance how splendidly i dance and how they would enjoy
dancing with me

the strains of the polonaise which had continued for a considerable
time had begun to sound like a sad reminiscence to natáshas ears she
wanted to cry peronskaya had left them the count was at the other end
of the room she and the countess and sónya were standing by themselves
as in the depths of a forest amid that crowd of strangers with no one
interested in them and not wanted by anyone prince andrew with a lady
passed by evidently not recognizing them the handsome anatole was
smilingly talking to a partner on his arm and looked at natásha as one
looks at a wall borís passed them twice and each time turned away berg
and his wife who were not dancing came up to them

this family gathering seemed humiliating to natáshaas if there were
nowhere else for the family to talk but here at the ball she did not
listen to or look at véra who was telling her something about her own
green dress

at last the emperor stopped beside his last partner he had danced with
three and the music ceased a worried aidedecamp ran up to the
rostóvs requesting them to stand farther back though as it was they
were already close to the wall and from the gallery resounded the
distinct precise enticingly rhythmical strains of a waltz the emperor
looked smilingly down the room a minute passed but no one had yet begun
dancing an aidedecamp the master of ceremonies went up to countess
bezúkhova and asked her to dance she smilingly raised her hand and laid
it on his shoulder without looking at him the aidedecamp an adept in
his art grasping his partner firmly round her waist with confident
deliberation started smoothly gliding first round the edge of the
circle then at the corner of the room he caught hélènes left hand and
turned her the only sound audible apart from the everquickening
music being the rhythmic click of the spurs on his rapid agile feet
while at every third beat his partners velvet dress spread out and
seemed to flash as she whirled round natásha gazed at them and was
ready to cry because it was not she who was dancing that first turn of
the waltz

prince andrew in the white uniform of a cavalry colonel wearing
stockings and dancing shoes stood looking animated and bright in the
front row of the circle not far from the rostóvs baron firhoff was
talking to him about the first sitting of the council of state to be
held next day prince andrew as one closely connected with speranski
and participating in the work of the legislative commission could give
reliable information about that sitting concerning which various rumors
were current but not listening to what firhoff was saying he was
gazing now at the sovereign and now at the men intending to dance who
had not yet gathered courage to enter the circle

prince andrew was watching these men abashed by the emperors presence
and the women who were breathlessly longing to be asked to dance

pierre came up to him and caught him by the arm

you always dance i have a protegee the young rostóva here ask her
he said

where is she asked bolkónski excuse me he added turning to the
baron we will finish this conversation elsewhereat a ball one must
dance he stepped forward in the direction pierre indicated the
despairing dejected expression of natáshas face caught his eye he
recognized her guessed her feelings saw that it was her debut
remembered her conversation at the window and with an expression of
pleasure on his face approached countess rostóva

allow me to introduce you to my daughter said the countess with
heightened color

i have the pleasure of being already acquainted if the countess
remembers me said prince andrew with a low and courteous bow quite
belying peronskayas remarks about his rudeness and approaching natásha
he held out his arm to grasp her waist before he had completed his
invitation he asked her to waltz that tremulous expression on
natáshas face prepared either for despair or rapture suddenly
brightened into a happy grateful childlike smile

i have long been waiting for you that frightened happy little girl
seemed to say by the smile that replaced the threatened tears as she
raised her hand to prince andrews shoulder they were the second couple
to enter the circle prince andrew was one of the best dancers of his
day and natásha danced exquisitely her little feet in their white satin
dancing shoes did their work swiftly lightly and independently of
herself while her face beamed with ecstatic happiness her slender bare
arms and neck were not beautifulcompared to hélènes her shoulders
looked thin and her bosom undeveloped but hélène seemed as it were
hardened by a varnish left by the thousands of looks that had scanned
her person while natásha was like a girl exposed for the first time
who would have felt very much ashamed had she not been assured that this
was absolutely necessary

prince andrew liked dancing and wishing to escape as quickly as
possible from the political and clever talk which everyone addressed to
him wishing also to break up the circle of restraint he disliked
caused by the emperors presence he danced and had chosen natásha
because pierre pointed her out to him and because she was the first
pretty girl who caught his eye but scarcely had he embraced that
slender supple figure and felt her stirring so close to him and smiling
so near him than the wine of her charm rose to his head and he felt
himself revived and rejuvenated when after leaving her he stood
breathing deeply and watching the other dancers





chapter xvii

after prince andrew borís came up to ask natásha for a dance and then
the aidedecamp who had opened the ball and several other young men
so that flushed and happy and passing on her superfluous partners to
sónya she did not cease dancing all the evening she noticed and saw
nothing of what occupied everyone else not only did she fail to notice
that the emperor talked a long time with the french ambassador and how
particularly gracious he was to a certain lady or that prince soandso
and soandso did and said this and that and that hélène had great
success and was honored by the special attention of soandso but she
did not even see the emperor and only noticed that he had gone because
the ball became livelier after his departure for one of the merry
cotillions before supper prince andrew was again her partner he
reminded her of their first encounter in the otradnoe avenue and how
she had been unable to sleep that moonlight night and told her how he
had involuntarily overheard her natásha blushed at that recollection
and tried to excuse herself as if there had been something to be
ashamed of in what prince andrew had overheard

like all men who have grown up in society prince andrew liked meeting
someone there not of the conventional society stamp and such was
natásha with her surprise her delight her shyness and even her
mistakes in speaking french with her he behaved with special care and
tenderness sitting beside her and talking of the simplest and most
unimportant matters he admired her shy grace in the middle of the
cotillion having completed one of the figures natásha still out of
breath was returning to her seat when another dancer chose her she was
tired and panting and evidently thought of declining but immediately
put her hand gaily on the mans shoulder smiling at prince andrew

id be glad to sit beside you and rest im tired but you see how they
keep asking me and im glad of it im happy and i love everybody and
you and i understand it all and much much more was said in her smile
when her partner left her natásha ran across the room to choose two
ladies for the figure

if she goes to her cousin first and then to another lady she will be
my wife said prince andrew to himself quite to his own surprise as he
watched her she did go first to her cousin

what rubbish sometimes enters ones head thought prince andrew but
what is certain is that that girl is so charming so original that she
wont be dancing here a month before she will be married such as she
are rare here he thought as natásha readjusting a rose that was
slipping on her bodice settled herself beside him

when the cotillion was over the old count in his blue coat came up to
the dancers he invited prince andrew to come and see them and asked
his daughter whether she was enjoying herself natásha did not answer at
once but only looked up with a smile that said reproachfully how can
you ask such a question

i have never enjoyed myself so much before she said and prince
andrew noticed how her thin arms rose quickly as if to embrace her
father and instantly dropped again natásha was happier than she had
ever been in her life she was at that height of bliss when one becomes
completely kind and good and does not believe in the possibility of
evil unhappiness or sorrow

at that ball pierre for the first time felt humiliated by the position
his wife occupied in court circles he was gloomy and absentminded a
deep furrow ran across his forehead and standing by a window he stared
over his spectacles seeing no one

on her way to supper natásha passed him

pierres gloomy unhappy look struck her she stopped in front of him
she wished to help him to bestow on him the superabundance of her own
happiness

how delightful it is count said she isnt it

pierre smiled absentmindedly evidently not grasping what she said

yes i am very glad he said

how can people be dissatisfied with anything thought natásha
especially such a capital fellow as bezúkhov in natáshas eyes all
the people at the ball alike were good kind and splendid people
loving one another none of them capable of injuring anotherand so they
ought all to be happy





chapter xviii

next day prince andrew thought of the ball but his mind did not dwell
on it long yes it was a very brilliant ball and then yes that
little rostóva is very charming theres something fresh original un
petersburglike about her that distinguishes her that was all he
thought about yesterdays ball and after his morning tea he set to
work

but either from fatigue or want of sleep he was illdisposed for work
and could get nothing done he kept criticizing his own work as he
often did and was glad when he heard someone coming

the visitor was bitski who served on various committees frequented all
the societies in petersburg and a passionate devotee of the new ideas
and of speranski and a diligent petersburg newsmongerone of those men
who choose their opinions like their clothes according to the fashion
but who for that very reason appear to be the warmest partisans hardly
had he got rid of his hat before he ran into prince andrews room with a
preoccupied air and at once began talking he had just heard particulars
of that mornings sitting of the council of state opened by the emperor
and he spoke of it enthusiastically the emperors speech had been
extraordinary it had been a speech such as only constitutional monarchs
deliver the sovereign plainly said that the council and senate are
estates of the realm he said that the government must rest not on
authority but on secure bases the emperor said that the fiscal system
must be reorganized and the accounts published recounted bitski
emphasizing certain words and opening his eyes significantly

ah yes todays events mark an epoch the greatest epoch in our
history he concluded

prince andrew listened to the account of the opening of the council of
state which he had so impatiently awaited and to which he had attached
such importance and was surprised that this event now that it had
taken place did not affect him and even seemed quite insignificant he
listened with quiet irony to bitskis enthusiastic account of it a very
simple thought occurred to him what does it matter to me or to bitski
what the emperor was pleased to say at the council can all that make me
any happier or better

and this simple reflection suddenly destroyed all the interest prince
andrew had felt in the impending reforms he was going to dine that
evening at speranskis with only a few friends as the host had said
when inviting him the prospect of that dinner in the intimate home
circle of the man he so admired had greatly interested prince andrew
especially as he had not yet seen speranski in his domestic
surroundings but now he felt disinclined to go to it

at the appointed hour however he entered the modest house speranski
owned in the taurida gardens in the parqueted dining room this small
house remarkable for its extreme cleanliness suggesting that of a
monastery prince andrew who was rather late found the friendly
gathering of speranskis intimate acquaintances already assembled at
five oclock there were no ladies present except speranskis little
daughter longfaced like her father and her governess the other
guests were gervais magnitski and stolypin while still in the
anteroom prince andrew heard loud voices and a ringing staccato laugha
laugh such as one hears on the stage someoneit sounded like
speranskiwas distinctly ejaculating hahaha prince andrew had never
before heard speranskis famous laugh and this ringing highpitched
laughter from a statesman made a strange impression on him

he entered the dining room the whole company were standing between two
windows at a small table laid with horsdoeuvres speranski wearing a
gray swallowtail coat with a star on the breast and evidently still
the same waistcoat and high white stock he had worn at the meeting of
the council of state stood at the table with a beaming countenance his
guests surrounded him magnitski addressing himself to speranski was
relating an anecdote and speranski was laughing in advance at what
magnitski was going to say when prince andrew entered the room
magnitskis words were again crowned by laughter stolypin gave a deep
bass guffaw as he munched a piece of bread and cheese gervais laughed
softly with a hissing chuckle and speranski in a highpitched staccato
manner

still laughing speranski held out his soft white hand to prince andrew

very pleased to see you prince he said one moment he went on
turning to magnitski and interrupting his story we have agreed that
this is a dinner for recreation with not a word about business and
turning again to the narrator he began to laugh afresh

prince andrew looked at the laughing speranski with astonishment
regret and disillusionment it seemed to him that this was not
speranski but someone else everything that had formerly appeared
mysterious and fascinating in speranski suddenly became plain and
unattractive

at dinner the conversation did not cease for a moment and seemed to
consist of the contents of a book of funny anecdotes before magnitski
had finished his story someone else was anxious to relate something
still funnier most of the anecdotes if not relating to the state
service related to people in the service it seemed that in this
company the insignificance of those people was so definitely accepted
that the only possible attitude toward them was one of good humored
ridicule speranski related how at the council that morning a deaf
dignitary when asked his opinion replied that he thought so too
gervais gave a long account of an official revision remarkable for the
stupidity of everybody concerned stolypin stuttering broke into the
conversation and began excitedly talking of the abuses that existed
under the former order of thingsthreatening to give a serious turn to
the conversation magnitski starting quizzing stolypin about his
vehemence gervais intervened with a joke and the talk reverted to its
former lively tone

evidently speranski liked to rest after his labors and find amusement in
a circle of friends and his guests understanding his wish tried to
enliven him and amuse themselves but their gaiety seemed to prince
andrew mirthless and tiresome speranskis highpitched voice struck him
unpleasantly and the incessant laughter grated on him like a false
note prince andrew did not laugh and feared that he would be a damper
on the spirits of the company but no one took any notice of his being
out of harmony with the general mood they all seemed very gay

he tried several times to join in the conversation but his remarks were
tossed aside each time like a cork thrown out of the water and he could
not jest with them

there was nothing wrong or unseemly in what they said it was witty and
might have been funny but it lacked just that something which is the
salt of mirth and they were not even aware that such a thing existed

after dinner speranskis daughter and her governess rose he patted the
little girl with his white hand and kissed her and that gesture too
seemed unnatural to prince andrew

the men remained at table over their portenglish fashion in the midst
of a conversation that was started about napoleons spanish affairs
which they all agreed in approving prince andrew began to express a
contrary opinion speranski smiled and with an evident wish to prevent
the conversation from taking an unpleasant course told a story that had
no connection with the previous conversation for a few moments all were
silent

having sat some time at table speranski corked a bottle of wine and
remarking nowadays good wine rides in a carriage and pair passed it
to the servant and got up all rose and continuing to talk loudly went
into the drawing room two letters brought by a courier were handed to
speranski and he took them to his study as soon as he had left the room
the general merriment stopped and the guests began to converse sensibly
and quietly with one another

now for the recitation said speranski on returning from his study a
wonderful talent he said to prince andrew and magnitski immediately
assumed a pose and began reciting some humorous verses in french which
he had composed about various wellknown petersburg people he was
interrupted several times by applause when the verses were finished
prince andrew went up to speranski and took his leave

where are you off to so early asked speranski

i promised to go to a reception

they said no more prince andrew looked closely into those mirrorlike
impenetrable eyes and felt that it had been ridiculous of him to have
expected anything from speranski and from any of his own activities
connected with him or ever to have attributed importance to what
speranski was doing that precise mirthless laughter rang in prince
andrews ears long after he had left the house

when he reached home prince andrew began thinking of his life in
petersburg during those last four months as if it were something new he
recalled his exertions and solicitations and the history of his project
of army reform which had been accepted for consideration and which they
were trying to pass over in silence simply because another a very poor
one had already been prepared and submitted to the emperor he thought
of the meetings of a committee of which berg was a member he remembered
how carefully and at what length everything relating to form and
procedure was discussed at those meetings and how sedulously and
promptly all that related to the gist of the business was evaded he
recalled his labors on the legal code and how painstakingly he had
translated the articles of the roman and french codes into russian and
he felt ashamed of himself then he vividly pictured to himself
bogucharovo his occupations in the country his journey to ryazan he
remembered the peasants and dron the village elder and mentally
applying to them the personal rights he had divided into paragraphs he
felt astonished that he could have spent so much time on such useless
work





chapter xix

next day prince andrew called at a few houses he had not visited before
and among them at the rostóvs with whom he had renewed acquaintance at
the ball apart from considerations of politeness which demanded the
call he wanted to see that original eager girl who had left such a
pleasant impression on his mind in her own home

natásha was one of the first to meet him she was wearing a darkblue
house dress in which prince andrew thought her even prettier than in her
ball dress she and all the rostóv family welcomed him as an old friend
simply and cordially the whole family whom he had formerly judged
severely now seemed to him to consist of excellent simple and kindly
people the old counts hospitality and good nature which struck one
especially in petersburg as a pleasant surprise were such that prince
andrew could not refuse to stay to dinner yes he thought they are
capital people who of course have not the slightest idea what a
treasure they possess in natásha but they are kindly folk and form the
best possible setting for this strikingly poetic charming girl
overflowing with life

in natásha prince andrew was conscious of a strange world completely
alien to him and brimful of joys unknown to him a different world that
in the otradnoe avenue and at the window that moonlight night had
already begun to disconcert him now this world disconcerted him no
longer and was no longer alien to him but he himself having entered it
found in it a new enjoyment

after dinner natásha at prince andrews request went to the clavichord
and began singing prince andrew stood by a window talking to the ladies
and listened to her in the midst of a phrase he ceased speaking and
suddenly felt tears choking him a thing he had thought impossible for
him he looked at natásha as she sang and something new and joyful
stirred in his soul he felt happy and at the same time sad he had
absolutely nothing to weep about yet he was ready to weep what about
his former love the little princess his disillusionments his hopes
for the future yes and no the chief reason was a sudden vivid
sense of the terrible contrast between something infinitely great and
illimitable within him and that limited and material something that he
and even she was this contrast weighed on and yet cheered him while
she sang

as soon as natásha had finished she went up to him and asked how he
liked her voice she asked this and then became confused feeling that
she ought not to have asked it he smiled looking at her and said he
liked her singing as he liked everything she did

prince andrew left the rostóvs late in the evening he went to bed from
habit but soon realized that he could not sleep having lit his candle
he sat up in bed then got up then lay down again not at all troubled
by his sleeplessness his soul was as fresh and joyful as if he had
stepped out of a stuffy room into gods own fresh air it did not enter
his head that he was in love with natásha he was not thinking about
her but only picturing her to himself and in consequence all life
appeared in a new light why do i strive why do i toil in this narrow
confined frame when life all life with all its joys is open to me
said he to himself and for the first time for a very long while he
began making happy plans for the future he decided that he must attend
to his sons education by finding a tutor and putting the boy in his
charge then he ought to retire from the service and go abroad and see
england switzerland and italy i must use my freedom while i feel so
much strength and youth in me he said to himself pierre was right
when he said one must believe in the possibility of happiness in order
to be happy and now i do believe in it let the dead bury their dead
but while one has life one must live and be happy thought he





chapter xx

one morning colonel berg whom pierre knew as he knew everybody in
moscow and petersburg came to see him berg arrived in an immaculate
brandnew uniform with his hair pomaded and brushed forward over his
temples as the emperor alexander wore his hair

i have just been to see the countess your wife unfortunately she
could not grant my request but i hope count i shall be more fortunate
with you he said with a smile

what is it you wish colonel i am at your service

i have now quite settled in my new rooms count berg said this with
perfect conviction that this information could not but be agreeable
and so i wish to arrange just a small party for my own and my wifes
friends he smiled still more pleasantly i wished to ask the
countess and you to do me the honor of coming to tea and to supper

only countess hélène considering the society of such people as the
bergs beneath her could be cruel enough to refuse such an invitation
berg explained so clearly why he wanted to collect at his house a small
but select company and why this would give him pleasure and why though
he grudged spending money on cards or anything harmful he was prepared
to run into some expense for the sake of good societythat pierre could
not refuse and promised to come

but dont be late count if i may venture to ask about ten minutes to
eight please we shall make up a rubber our general is coming he is
very good to me we shall have supper count so you will do me the
favor

contrary to his habit of being late pierre on that day arrived at the
bergs house not at ten but at fifteen minutes to eight

having prepared everything necessary for the party the bergs were ready
for their guests arrival

in their new clean and light study with its small busts and pictures
and new furniture sat berg and his wife berg closely buttoned up in
his new uniform sat beside his wife explaining to her that one always
could and should be acquainted with people above one because only then
does one get satisfaction from acquaintances

you can get to know something you can ask for something see how i
managed from my first promotion berg measured his life not by years
but by promotions my comrades are still nobodies while i am only
waiting for a vacancy to command a regiment and have the happiness to
be your husband he rose and kissed véras hand and on the way to her
straightened out a turnedup corner of the carpet and how have i
obtained all this chiefly by knowing how to choose my aquaintances it
goes without saying that one must be conscientious and methodical

berg smiled with a sense of his superiority over a weak woman and
paused reflecting that this dear wife of his was after all but a weak
woman who could not understand all that constitutes a mans dignity
what it was ein mann zu sein  véra at the same time smiling with a
sense of superiority over her good conscientious husband who all the
same understood life wrongly as according to véra all men did berg
judging by his wife thought all women weak and foolish véra judging
only by her husband and generalizing from that observation supposed
that all men though they understand nothing and are conceited and
selfish ascribe common sense to themselves alone

 to be a man

berg rose and embraced his wife carefully so as not to crush her lace
fichu for which he had paid a good price kissing her straight on the
lips

the only thing is we mustnt have children too soon he continued
following an unconscious sequence of ideas

yes answered véra i dont at all want that we must live for
society

princess yusupova wore one exactly like this said berg pointing to
the fichu with a happy and kindly smile

just then count bezúkhov was announced husband and wife glanced at one
another both smiling with selfsatisfaction and each mentally claiming
the honor of this visit

this is what comes of knowing how to make acquaintances thought berg
this is what comes of knowing how to conduct oneself

but please dont interrupt me when i am entertaining the guests said
véra because i know what interests each of them and what to say to
different people

berg smiled again

it cant be helped men must sometimes have masculine conversation
said he

they received pierre in their small new drawing room where it was
impossible to sit down anywhere without disturbing its symmetry
neatness and order so it was quite comprehensible and not strange that
berg having generously offered to disturb the symmetry of an armchair
or of the sofa for his dear guest but being apparently painfully
undecided on the matter himself eventually left the visitor to settle
the question of selection pierre disturbed the symmetry by moving a
chair for himself and berg and véra immediately began their evening
party interrupting each other in their efforts to entertain their
guest

véra having decided in her own mind that pierre ought to be entertained
with conversation about the french embassy at once began accordingly
berg having decided that masculine conversation was required
interrupted his wifes remarks and touched on the question of the war
with austria and unconsciously jumped from the general subject to
personal considerations as to the proposals made him to take part in the
austrian campaign and the reasons why he had declined them though the
conversation was very incoherent and véra was angry at the intrusion of
the masculine element both husband and wife felt with satisfaction
that even if only one guest was present their evening had begun very
well and was as like as two peas to every other evening party with its
talk tea and lighted candles

before long borís bergs old comrade arrived there was a shade of
condescension and patronage in his treatment of berg and véra after
borís came a lady with the colonel then the general himself then the
rostóvs and the party became unquestionably exactly like all other
evening parties berg and véra could not repress their smiles of
satisfaction at the sight of all this movement in their drawing room at
the sound of the disconnected talk the rustling of dresses and the
bowing and scraping everything was just as everybody always has it
especially so the general who admired the apartment patted berg on the
shoulder and with parental authority superintended the setting out of
the table for boston the general sat down by count ilyá rostóv who was
next to himself the most important guest the old people sat with the
old the young with the young and the hostess at the tea table on
which stood exactly the same kind of cakes in a silver cake basket as
the panins had at their party everything was just as it was everywhere
else





chapter xxi

pierre as one of the principal guests had to sit down to boston with
count rostóv the general and the colonel at the card table he
happened to be directly facing natásha and was struck by a curious
change that had come over her since the ball she was silent and not
only less pretty than at the ball but only redeemed from plainness by
her look of gentle indifference to everything around

whats the matter with her thought pierre glancing at her she was
sitting by her sister at the tea table and reluctantly without looking
at him made some reply to borís who sat down beside her after playing
out a whole suit and to his partners delight taking five tricks
pierre hearing greetings and the steps of someone who had entered the
room while he was picking up his tricks glanced again at natásha

what has happened to her he asked himself with still greater
surprise

prince andrew was standing before her saying something to her with a
look of tender solicitude she having raised her head was looking up
at him flushed and evidently trying to master her rapid breathing and
the bright glow of some inner fire that had been suppressed was again
alight in her she was completely transformed and from a plain girl had
again become what she had been at the ball

prince andrew went up to pierre and the latter noticed a new and
youthful expression in his friends face

pierre changed places several times during the game sitting now with
his back to natásha and now facing her but during the whole of the six
rubbers he watched her and his friend

something very important is happening between them thought pierre
and a feeling that was both joyful and painful agitated him and made him
neglect the game

after six rubbers the general got up saying that it was no use playing
like that and pierre was released natásha on one side was talking with
sónya and borís and véra with a subtle smile was saying something to
prince andrew pierre went up to his friend and asking whether they
were talking secrets sat down beside them véra having noticed prince
andrews attentions to natásha decided that at a party a real evening
party subtle allusions to the tender passion were absolutely necessary
and seizing a moment when prince andrew was alone began a conversation
with him about feelings in general and about her sister with so
intellectual a guest as she considered prince andrew to be she felt
that she had to employ her diplomatic tact

when pierre went up to them he noticed that véra was being carried away
by her selfsatisfied talk but that prince andrew seemed embarrassed a
thing that rarely happened with him

what do you think véra was saying with an arch smile you are so
discerning prince and understand peoples characters so well at a
glance what do you think of natalie could she be constant in her
attachments could she like other women véra meant herself love a
man once for all and remain true to him forever that is what i consider
true love what do you think prince

i know your sister too little replied prince andrew with a sarcastic
smile under which he wished to hide his embarrassment to be able to
solve so delicate a question and then i have noticed that the less
attractive a woman is the more constant she is likely to be he added
and looked up at pierre who was just approaching them

yes that is true prince in our days continued véramentioning our
days as people of limited intelligence are fond of doing imagining
that they have discovered and appraised the peculiarities of our days
and that human characteristics change with the timesin our days a girl
has so much freedom that the pleasure of being courted often stifles
real feeling in her and it must be confessed that natalie is very
susceptible this return to the subject of natalie caused prince andrew
to knit his brows with discomfort he was about to rise but véra
continued with a still more subtle smile

i think no one has been more courted than she she went on but till
quite lately she never cared seriously for anyone now you know count
she said to pierre even our dear cousin borís who between ourselves
was very far gone in the land of tenderness alluding to a map of
love much in vogue at that time

prince andrew frowned and remained silent

you are friendly with borís arent you asked véra

yes i know him

i expect he has told you of his childish love for natásha

oh there was childish love suddenly asked prince andrew blushing
unexpectedly

yes you know between cousins intimacy often leads to love le
cousinage est un dangereux voisinage  dont you think so

 cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood

oh undoubtedly said prince andrew and with sudden and unnatural
liveliness he began chaffing pierre about the need to be very careful
with his fiftyyearold moscow cousins and in the midst of these
jesting remarks he rose taking pierre by the arm and drew him aside

well asked pierre seeing his friends strange animation with
surprise and noticing the glance he turned on natásha as he rose

i must i must have a talk with you said prince andrew you know
that pair of womens gloves he referred to the masonic gloves given
to a newly initiated brother to present to the woman he loved i
but no i will talk to you later on and with a strange light in his
eyes and restlessness in his movements prince andrew approached natásha
and sat down beside her pierre saw how prince andrew asked her
something and how she flushed as she replied

but at that moment berg came to pierre and began insisting that he
should take part in an argument between the general and the colonel on
the affairs in spain

berg was satisfied and happy the smile of pleasure never left his face
the party was very successful and quite like other parties he had seen
everything was similar the ladies subtle talk the cards the general
raising his voice at the card table and the samovar and the tea cakes
only one thing was lacking that he had always seen at the evening
parties he wished to imitate they had not yet had a loud conversation
among the men and a dispute about something important and clever now
the general had begun such a discussion and so berg drew pierre to it





chapter xxii

next day having been invited by the count prince andrew dined with the
rostóvs and spent the rest of the day there

everyone in the house realized for whose sake prince andrew came and
without concealing it he tried to be with natásha all day not only in
the soul of the frightened yet happy and enraptured natásha but in the
whole house there was a feeling of awe at something important that was
bound to happen the countess looked with sad and sternly serious eyes
at prince andrew when he talked to natásha and timidly started some
artificial conversation about trifles as soon as he looked her way
sónya was afraid to leave natásha and afraid of being in the way when
she was with them natásha grew pale in a panic of expectation when
she remained alone with him for a moment prince andrew surprised her by
his timidity she felt that he wanted to say something to her but could
not bring himself to do so

in the evening when prince andrew had left the countess went up to
natásha and whispered well what

mamma for heavens sake dont ask me anything now one cant talk
about that said natásha

but all the same that night natásha now agitated and now frightened
lay a long time in her mothers bed gazing straight before her she told
her how he had complimented her how he told her he was going abroad
asked her where they were going to spend the summer and then how he had
asked her about borís

but such a such a never happened to me before she said only i
feel afraid in his presence i am always afraid when im with him what
does that mean does it mean that its the real thing yes mamma are
you asleep

no my love i am frightened myself answered her mother now go

all the same i shant sleep what silliness to sleep mummy mummy
such a thing never happened to me before she said surprised and
alarmed at the feeling she was aware of in herself and could we ever
have thought

it seemed to natásha that even at the time she first saw prince andrew
at otradnoe she had fallen in love with him it was as if she feared
this strange unexpected happiness of meeting again the very man she had
then chosen she was firmly convinced she had done so and of finding
him as it seemed not indifferent to her

and it had to happen that he should come specially to petersburg while
we are here and it had to happen that we should meet at that ball it
is fate clearly it is fate that everything led up to this already
then directly i saw him i felt something peculiar

what else did he say to you what are those verses read them said
her mother thoughtfully referring to some verses prince andrew had
written in natáshas album

mamma one need not be ashamed of his being a widower

dont natásha pray to god marriages are made in heaven said her
mother

darling mummy how i love you how happy i am cried natásha shedding
tears of joy and excitement and embracing her mother

at that very time prince andrew was sitting with pierre and telling him
of his love for natásha and his firm resolve to make her his wife

that day countess hélène had a reception at her house the french
ambassador was there and a foreign prince of the blood who had of late
become a frequent visitor of hers and many brilliant ladies and
gentlemen pierre who had come downstairs walked through the rooms and
struck everyone by his preoccupied absentminded and morose air

since the ball he had felt the approach of a fit of nervous depression
and had made desperate efforts to combat it since the intimacy of his
wife with the royal prince pierre had unexpectedly been made a
gentleman of the bedchamber and from that time he had begun to feel
oppressed and ashamed in court society and dark thoughts of the vanity
of all things human came to him oftener than before at the same time
the feeling he had noticed between his protegee natásha and prince
andrew accentuated his gloom by the contrast between his own position
and his friends he tried equally to avoid thinking about his wife and
about natásha and prince andrew and again everything seemed to him
insignificant in comparison with eternity again the question for what
presented itself and he forced himself to work day and night at masonic
labors hoping to drive away the evil spirit that threatened him toward
midnight after he had left the countess apartments he was sitting
upstairs in a shabby dressing gown copying out the original transaction
of the scottish lodge of freemasons at a table in his low room cloudy
with tobacco smoke when someone came in it was prince andrew

ah its you said pierre with a preoccupied dissatisfied air and
i you see am hard at it he pointed to his manuscript book with that
air of escaping from the ills of life with which unhappy people look at
their work

prince andrew with a beaming ecstatic expression of renewed life on
his face paused in front of pierre and not noticing his sad look
smiled at him with the egotism of joy

well dear heart said he i wanted to tell you about it yesterday
and i have come to do so today i never experienced anything like it
before i am in love my friend

suddenly pierre heaved a deep sigh and dumped his heavy person down on
the sofa beside prince andrew

with natásha rostóva yes said he

yes yes who else should it be i should never have believed it but
the feeling is stronger than i yesterday i tormented myself and
suffered but i would not exchange even that torment for anything in the
world i have not lived till now at last i live but i cant live
without her but can she love me i am too old for her why dont
you speak

i i what did i tell you said pierre suddenly rising and beginning
to pace up and down the room i always thought it that girl is such
a treasure she is a rare girl my dear friend i entreat you
dont philosophize dont doubt marry marry marry and i am sure
there will not be a happier man than you

but what of her

she loves you

dont talk rubbish said prince andrew smiling and looking into
pierres eyes

she does i know pierre cried fiercely

but do listen returned prince andrew holding him by the arm do you
know the condition i am in i must talk about it to someone

well go on go on i am very glad said pierre and his face really
changed his brow became smooth and he listened gladly to prince
andrew prince andrew seemed and really was quite a different quite a
new man where was his spleen his contempt for life his
disillusionment pierre was the only person to whom he made up his mind
to speak openly and to him he told all that was in his soul now he
boldly and lightly made plans for an extended future said he could not
sacrifice his own happiness to his fathers caprice and spoke of how he
would either make his father consent to this marriage and love her or
would do without his consent then he marveled at the feeling that had
mastered him as at something strange apart from and independent of
himself

i should not have believed anyone who told me that i was capable of
such love said prince andrew it is not at all the same feeling that
i knew in the past the whole world is now for me divided into two
halves one half is she and there all is joy hope light the other
half is everything where she is not and there is all gloom and
darkness

darkness and gloom reiterated pierre yes yes i understand that

i cannot help loving the light it is not my fault and i am very
happy you understand me i know you are glad for my sake

yes yes pierre assented looking at his friend with a touched and
sad expression in his eyes the brighter prince andrews lot appeared to
him the gloomier seemed his own





chapter xxiii

prince andrew needed his fathers consent to his marriage and to obtain
this he started for the country next day

his father received his sons communication with external composure but
inward wrath he could not comprehend how anyone could wish to alter his
life or introduce anything new into it when his own life was already
ending if only they would let me end my days as i want to thought
the old man then they might do as they please with his son however
he employed the diplomacy he reserved for important occasions and
adopting a quiet tone discussed the whole matter

in the first place the marriage was not a brilliant one as regards
birth wealth or rank secondly prince andrew was no longer as young
as he had been and his health was poor the old man laid special stress
on this while she was very young thirdly he had a son whom it would
be a pity to entrust to a chit of a girl fourthly and finally the
father said looking ironically at his son i beg you to put it off for
a year go abroad take a cure look out as you wanted to for a german
tutor for prince nicholas then if your love or passion or obstinacyas
you pleaseis still as great marry and thats my last word on it
mind the last concluded the prince in a tone which showed that
nothing would make him alter his decision

prince andrew saw clearly that the old man hoped that his feelings or
his fiancees would not stand a years test or that he the old prince
himself would die before then and he decided to conform to his
fathers wishto propose and postpone the wedding for a year

three weeks after the last evening he had spent with the rostóvs prince
andrew returned to petersburg

next day after her talk with her mother natásha expected bolkónski all
day but he did not come on the second and third day it was the same
pierre did not come either and natásha not knowing that prince andrew
had gone to see his father could not explain his absence to herself

three weeks passed in this way natásha had no desire to go out anywhere
and wandered from room to room like a shadow idle and listless she
wept secretly at night and did not go to her mother in the evenings she
blushed continually and was irritable it seemed to her that everybody
knew about her disappointment and was laughing at her and pitying her
strong as was her inward grief this wound to her vanity intensified her
misery

once she came to her mother tried to say something and suddenly began
to cry her tears were those of an offended child who does not know why
it is being punished

the countess began to soothe natásha who after first listening to her
mothers words suddenly interrupted her

leave off mamma i dont think and dont want to think about it he
just came and then left off left off

her voice trembled and she again nearly cried but recovered and went
on quietly

and i dont at all want to get married and i am afraid of him i have
now become quite calm quite calm

the day after this conversation natásha put on the old dress which she
knew had the peculiar property of conducing to cheerfulness in the
mornings and that day she returned to the old way of life which she had
abandoned since the ball having finished her morning tea she went to
the ballroom which she particularly liked for its loud resonance and
began singing her solfeggio when she had finished her first exercise
she stood still in the middle of the room and sang a musical phrase that
particularly pleased her she listened joyfully as though she had not
expected it to the charm of the notes reverberating filling the whole
empty ballroom and slowly dying away and all at once she felt
cheerful whats the good of making so much of it things are nice as
it is she said to herself and she began walking up and down the room
not stepping simply on the resounding parquet but treading with each
step from the heel to the toe she had on a new and favorite pair of
shoes and listening to the regular tap of the heel and creak of the toe
as gladly as she had to the sounds of her own voice passing a mirror
she glanced into it there thats me the expression of her face
seemed to say as she caught sight of herself well and very nice too
i need nobody

a footman wanted to come in to clear away something in the room but she
would not let him and having closed the door behind him continued her
walk that morning she had returned to her favorite moodlove of and
delight in herself how charming that natásha is she said again
speaking as some third collective male person pretty a good voice
young and in nobodys way if only they leave her in peace but however
much they left her in peace she could not now be at peace and
immediately felt this

in the hall the porch door opened and someone asked at home and
then footsteps were heard natásha was looking at the mirror but did
not see herself she listened to the sounds in the hall when she saw
herself her face was pale it was he she knew this for certain though
she hardly heard his voice through the closed doors

pale and agitated natásha ran into the drawing room

mamma bolkónski has come she said mamma it is awful it is
unbearable i dont want to be tormented what am i to do

before the countess could answer prince andrew entered the room with an
agitated and serious face as soon as he saw natásha his face
brightened he kissed the countess hand and natáshas and sat down
beside the sofa

it is long since we had the pleasure began the countess but prince
andrew interrupted her by answering her intended question obviously in
haste to say what he had to

i have not been to see you all this time because i have been at my
fathers i had to talk over a very important matter with him i only
got back last night he said glancing at natásha i want to have a
talk with you countess he added after a moments pause

the countess lowered her eyes sighing deeply

i am at your disposal she murmured

natásha knew that she ought to go away but was unable to do so
something gripped her throat and regardless of manners she stared
straight at prince andrew with wideopen eyes

at once this instant no it cant be she thought

again he glanced at her and that glance convinced her that she was not
mistaken yes at once that very instant her fate would be decided

go natásha i will call you said the countess in a whisper

natásha glanced with frightened imploring eyes at prince andrew and at
her mother and went out

i have come countess to ask for your daughters hand said prince
andrew

the countess face flushed hotly but she said nothing

your offer she began at last sedately he remained silent looking
into her eyes your offer she grew confused is agreeable to us
and i accept your offer i am glad and my husband i hope but it
will depend on her

i will speak to her when i have your consent do you give it to me
said prince andrew

yes replied the countess she held out her hand to him and with a
mixed feeling of estrangement and tenderness pressed her lips to his
forehead as he stooped to kiss her hand she wished to love him as a
son but felt that to her he was a stranger and a terrifying man i am
sure my husband will consent said the countess but your father

my father to whom i have told my plans has made it an express
condition of his consent that the wedding is not to take place for a
year and i wished to tell you of that said prince andrew

it is true that natásha is still young butso long as that

it is unavoidable said prince andrew with a sigh

i will send her to you said the countess and left the room

lord have mercy upon us she repeated while seeking her daughter

sónya said that natásha was in her bedroom natásha was sitting on the
bed pale and dry eyed and was gazing at the icons and whispering
something as she rapidly crossed herself seeing her mother she jumped
up and flew to her

well mamma well

go go to him he is asking for your hand said the countess coldly
it seemed to natásha go go said the mother sadly and
reproachfully with a deep sigh as her daughter ran away

natásha never remembered how she entered the drawing room when she came
in and saw him she paused is it possible that this stranger has now
become everything to me she asked herself and immediately answered
yes everything he alone is now dearer to me than everything in the
world prince andrew came up to her with downcast eyes

i have loved you from the very first moment i saw you may i hope

he looked at her and was struck by the serious impassioned expression of
her face her face said why ask why doubt what you cannot but know
why speak when words cannot express what one feels

she drew near to him and stopped he took her hand and kissed it

do you love me

yes yes natásha murmured as if in vexation then she sighed loudly
and catching her breath more and more quickly began to sob

what is it whats the matter

oh i am so happy she replied smiled through her tears bent over
closer to him paused for an instant as if asking herself whether she
might and then kissed him

prince andrew held her hands looked into her eyes and did not find in
his heart his former love for her something in him had suddenly
changed there was no longer the former poetic and mystic charm of
desire but there was pity for her feminine and childish weakness fear
at her devotion and trustfulness and an oppressive yet joyful sense of
the duty that now bound him to her forever the present feeling though
not so bright and poetic as the former was stronger and more serious

did your mother tell you that it cannot be for a year asked prince
andrew still looking into her eyes

is it possible that ithe chit of a girl as everybody called me
thought natáshais it possible that i am now to be the wife and the
equal of this strange dear clever man whom even my father looks up to
can it be true can it be true that there can be no more playing with
life that now i am grown up that on me now lies a responsibility for
my every word and deed yes but what did he ask me

no she replied but she had not understood his question

forgive me he said but you are so young and i have already been
through so much in life i am afraid for you you do not yet know
yourself

natásha listened with concentrated attention trying but failing to take
in the meaning of his words

hard as this year which delays my happiness will be continued prince
andrew it will give you time to be sure of yourself i ask you to make
me happy in a year but you are free our engagement shall remain a
secret and should you find that you do not love me or should you come
to love said prince andrew with an unnatural smile

why do you say that natásha interrupted him you know that from the
very day you first came to otradnoe i have loved you she cried quite
convinced that she spoke the truth

in a year you will learn to know yourself

a whole year natásha repeated suddenly only now realizing that the
marriage was to be postponed for a year but why a year why a
year

prince andrew began to explain to her the reasons for this delay
natásha did not hear him

and cant it be helped she asked prince andrew did not reply but
his face expressed the impossibility of altering that decision

its awful oh its awful awful natásha suddenly cried and again
burst into sobs i shall die waiting a year its impossible its
awful she looked into her lovers face and saw in it a look of
commiseration and perplexity

no no ill do anything she said suddenly checking her tears i am
so happy

the father and mother came into the room and gave the betrothed couple
their blessing

from that day prince andrew began to frequent the rostóvs as natáshas
affianced lover





chapter xxiv

no betrothal ceremony took place and natáshas engagement to bolkónski
was not announced prince andrew insisted on that he said that as he
was responsible for the delay he ought to bear the whole burden of it
that he had given his word and bound himself forever but that he did
not wish to bind natásha and gave her perfect freedom if after six
months she felt that she did not love him she would have full right to
reject him naturally neither natásha nor her parents wished to hear of
this but prince andrew was firm he came every day to the rostóvs but
did not behave to natásha as an affianced lover he did not use the
familiar thou but said you to her and kissed only her hand after
their engagement quite different intimate and natural relations
sprang up between them it was as if they had not known each other till
now both liked to recall how they had regarded each other when as yet
they were nothing to one another they felt themselves now quite
different beings then they were artificial now natural and sincere at
first the family felt some constraint in intercourse with prince andrew
he seemed a man from another world and for a long time natásha trained
the family to get used to him proudly assuring them all that he only
appeared to be different but was really just like all of them and that
she was not afraid of him and no one else ought to be after a few days
they grew accustomed to him and without restraint in his presence
pursued their usual way of life in which he took his part he could
talk about rural economy with the count fashions with the countess and
natásha and about albums and fancywork with sónya sometimes the
household both among themselves and in his presence expressed their
wonder at how it had all happened and at the evident omens there had
been of it prince andrews coming to otradnoe and their coming to
petersburg and the likeness between natásha and prince andrew which her
nurse had noticed on his first visit and andrews encounter with
nicholas in  and many other incidents betokening that it had to be

in the house that poetic dullness and quiet reigned which always
accompanies the presence of a betrothed couple often when all sitting
together everyone kept silent sometimes the others would get up and go
away and the couple left alone still remained silent they rarely
spoke of their future life prince andrew was afraid and ashamed to
speak of it natásha shared this as she did all his feelings which she
constantly divined once she began questioning him about his son prince
andrew blushed as he often did nownatásha particularly liked it in
himand said that his son would not live with them

why not asked natásha in a frightened tone

i cannot take him away from his grandfather and besides

how i should have loved him said natásha immediately guessing his
thought but i know you wish to avoid any pretext for finding fault
with us

sometimes the old count would come up kiss prince andrew and ask his
advice about pétyas education or nicholas service the old countess
sighed as she looked at them sónya was always getting frightened lest
she should be in the way and tried to find excuses for leaving them
alone even when they did not wish it when prince andrew spoke he
could tell a story very well natásha listened to him with pride when
she spoke she noticed with fear and joy that he gazed attentively and
scrutinizingly at her she asked herself in perplexity what does he
look for in me he is trying to discover something by looking at me
what if what he seeks in me is not there sometimes she fell into one
of the mad merry moods characteristic of her and then she particularly
loved to hear and see how prince andrew laughed he seldom laughed but
when he did he abandoned himself entirely to his laughter and after
such a laugh she always felt nearer to him natásha would have been
completely happy if the thought of the separation awaiting her and
drawing near had not terrified her just as the mere thought of it made
him turn pale and cold

on the eve of his departure from petersburg prince andrew brought with
him pierre who had not been to the rostóvs once since the ball pierre
seemed disconcerted and embarrassed he was talking to the countess and
natásha sat down beside a little chess table with sónya thereby
inviting prince andrew to come too he did so

you have known bezúkhov a long time he asked do you like him

yes hes a dear but very absurd

and as usual when speaking of pierre she began to tell anecdotes of his
absentmindedness some of which had even been invented about him

do you know i have entrusted him with our secret i have known him from
childhood he has a heart of gold i beg you natalie prince andrew
said with sudden seriousnessi am going away and heaven knows what may
happen you may cease to all right i know i am not to say that only
this then whatever may happen to you when i am not here

what can happen

whatever trouble may come prince andrew continued i beg you
mademoiselle sophie whatever may happen to turn to him alone for
advice and help he is a most absentminded and absurd fellow but he
has a heart of gold

neither her father nor her mother nor sónya nor prince andrew himself
could have foreseen how the separation from her lover would act on
natásha flushed and agitated she went about the house all that day
dryeyed occupied with most trivial matters as if not understanding
what awaited her she did not even cry when on taking leave he kissed
her hand for the last time dont go she said in a tone that made him
wonder whether he really ought not to stay and which he remembered long
afterwards nor did she cry when he was gone but for several days she
sat in her room dryeyed taking no interest in anything and only saying
now and then oh why did he go away

but a fortnight after his departure to the surprise of those around
her she recovered from her mental sickness just as suddenly and became
her old self again but with a change in her moral physiognomy as a
child gets up after a long illness with a changed expression of face





chapter xxv

during that year after his sons departure prince nicholas bolkónskis
health and temper became much worse he grew still more irritable and
it was princess mary who generally bore the brunt of his frequent fits
of unprovoked anger he seemed carefully to seek out her tender spots so
as to torture her mentally as harshly as possible princess mary had two
passions and consequently two joysher nephew little nicholas and
religionand these were the favorite subjects of the princes attacks
and ridicule whatever was spoken of he would bring round to the
superstitiousness of old maids or the petting and spoiling of children
you want to make himlittle nicholasinto an old maid like yourself
a pity prince andrew wants a son and not an old maid he would say
or turning to mademoiselle bourienne he would ask her in princess
marys presence how she liked our village priests and icons and would
joke about them

he continually hurt princess marys feelings and tormented her but it
cost her no effort to forgive him could he be to blame toward her or
could her father whom she knew loved her in spite of it all be unjust
and what is justice the princess never thought of that proud word
justice all the complex laws of man centered for her in one clear and
simple lawthe law of love and selfsacrifice taught us by him who
lovingly suffered for mankind though he himself was god what had she to
do with the justice or injustice of other people she had to endure and
love and that she did

during the winter prince andrew had come to bald hills and had been gay
gentle and more affectionate than princess mary had known him for a
long time past she felt that something had happened to him but he said
nothing to her about his love before he left he had a long talk with
his father about something and princess mary noticed that before his
departure they were dissatisfied with one another

soon after prince andrew had gone princess mary wrote to her friend
julie karágina in petersburg whom she had dreamed as all girls dream
of marrying to her brother and who was at that time in mourning for her
own brother killed in turkey

sorrow it seems is our common lot my dear tender friend julie

your loss is so terrible that i can only explain it to myself as a
special providence of god who loving you wishes to try you and your
excellent mother oh my friend religion and religion alone cani
will not say comfort usbut save us from despair religion alone can
explain to us what without its help man cannot comprehend why for what
cause kind and noble beings able to find happiness in lifenot merely
harming no one but necessary to the happiness of othersare called away
to god while cruel useless harmful persons or such as are a burden
to themselves and to others are left living the first death i saw and
one i shall never forgetthat of my dear sisterinlawleft that
impression on me just as you ask destiny why your splendid brother had
to die so i asked why that angel lise who not only never wronged
anyone but in whose soul there were never any unkind thoughts had to
die and what do you think dear friend five years have passed since
then and already i with my petty understanding begin to see clearly
why she had to die and in what way that death was but an expression of
the infinite goodness of the creator whose every action though
generally incomprehensible to us is but a manifestation of his infinite
love for his creatures perhaps i often think she was too angelically
innocent to have the strength to perform all a mothers duties as a
young wife she was irreproachable perhaps she could not have been so as
a mother as it is not only has she left us and particularly prince
andrew with the purest regrets and memories but probably she will
there receive a place i dare not hope for myself but not to speak of
her alone that early and terrible death has had the most beneficent
influence on me and on my brother in spite of all our grief then at
the moment of our loss these thoughts could not occur to me i should
then have dismissed them with horror but now they are very clear and
certain i write all this to you dear friend only to convince you of
the gospel truth which has become for me a principle of life not a
single hair of our heads will fall without his will and his will is
governed only by infinite love for us and so whatever befalls us is for
our good

you ask whether we shall spend next winter in moscow in spite of my
wish to see you i do not think so and do not want to do so you will be
surprised to hear that the reason for this is buonaparte the case is
this my fathers health is growing noticeably worse he cannot stand
any contradiction and is becoming irritable this irritability is as
you know chiefly directed to political questions he cannot endure the
notion that buonaparte is negotiating on equal terms with all the
sovereigns of europe and particularly with our own the grandson of the
great catherine as you know i am quite indifferent to politics but
from my fathers remarks and his talks with michael ivánovich i know all
that goes on in the world and especially about the honors conferred on
buonaparte who only at bald hills in the whole world it seems is not
accepted as a great man still less as emperor of france and my father
cannot stand this it seems to me that it is chiefly because of his
political views that my father is reluctant to speak of going to moscow
for he foresees the encounters that would result from his way of
expressing his views regardless of anybody all the benefit he might
derive from a course of treatment he would lose as a result of the
disputes about buonaparte which would be inevitable in any case it will
be decided very shortly

our family life goes on in the old way except for my brother andrews
absence he as i wrote you before has changed very much of late after
his sorrow he only this year quite recovered his spirits he has again
become as i used to know him when a child kind affectionate with that
heart of gold to which i know no equal he has realized it seems to me
that life is not over for him but together with this mental change he
has grown physically much weaker he has become thinner and more
nervous i am anxious about him and glad he is taking this trip abroad
which the doctors recommended long ago i hope it will cure him you
write that in petersburg he is spoken of as one of the most active
cultivated and capable of the young men forgive my vanity as a
relation but i never doubted it the good he has done to everybody
here from his peasants up to the gentry is incalculable on his
arrival in petersburg he received only his due i always wonder at the
way rumors fly from petersburg to moscow especially such false ones as
that you write abouti mean the report of my brothers betrothal to the
little rostóva i do not think my brother will ever marry again and
certainly not her and this is why first i know that though he rarely
speaks about the wife he has lost the grief of that loss has gone too
deep in his heart for him ever to decide to give her a successor and our
little angel a stepmother secondly because as far as i know that girl
is not the kind of girl who could please prince andrew i do not think
he would choose her for a wife and frankly i do not wish it but i am
running on too long and am at the end of my second sheet goodbye my
dear friend may god keep you in his holy and mighty care my dear
friend mademoiselle bourienne sends you kisses

mary




chapter xxvi

in the middle of the summer princess mary received an unexpected letter
from prince andrew in switzerland in which he gave her strange and
surprising news he informed her of his engagement to natásha rostóva
the whole letter breathed loving rapture for his betrothed and tender
and confiding affection for his sister he wrote that he had never loved
as he did now and that only now did he understand and know what life
was he asked his sister to forgive him for not having told her of his
resolve when he had last visited bald hills though he had spoken of it
to his father he had not done so for fear princess mary should ask her
father to give his consent irritating him and having to bear the brunt
of his displeasure without attaining her object besides he wrote
the matter was not then so definitely settled as it is now my father
then insisted on a delay of a year and now already six months half of
that period have passed and my resolution is firmer than ever if the
doctors did not keep me here at the spas i should be back in russia but
as it is i have to postpone my return for three months you know me and
my relations with father i want nothing from him i have been and
always shall be independent but to go against his will and arouse his
anger now that he may perhaps remain with us such a short time would
destroy half my happiness i am now writing to him about the same
question and beg you to choose a good moment to hand him the letter and
to let me know how he looks at the whole matter and whether there is
hope that he may consent to reduce the term by four months

after long hesitations doubts and prayers princess mary gave the
letter to her father the next day the old prince said to her quietly

write and tell your brother to wait till i am dead it wont be
longi shall soon set him free

the princess was about to reply but her father would not let her speak
and raising his voice more and more cried

marry marry my boy a good family clever people eh rich eh
yes a nice stepmother little nicholas will have write and tell him
that he may marry tomorrow if he likes she will be little nicholas
stepmother and ill marry bourienne ha ha ha he mustnt be
without a stepmother either only one thing no more women are wanted in
my houselet him marry and live by himself perhaps you will go and live
with him too he added turning to princess mary go in heavens name
go out into the frost the frost the frost

after this outburst the prince did not speak any more about the matter
but repressed vexation at his sons poorspirited behavior found
expression in his treatment of his daughter to his former pretexts for
irony a fresh one was now addedallusions to stepmothers and
amiabilities to mademoiselle bourienne

why shouldnt i marry her he asked his daughter shell make a
splendid princess

and latterly to her surprise and bewilderment princess mary noticed
that her father was really associating more and more with the
frenchwoman she wrote to prince andrew about the reception of his
letter but comforted him with hopes of reconciling their father to the
idea

little nicholas and his education her brother andrew and religion were
princess marys joys and consolations but besides that since everyone
must have personal hopes princess mary in the profoundest depths of her
heart had a hidden dream and hope that supplied the chief consolation of
her life this comforting dream and hope were given her by gods
folkthe halfwitted and other pilgrims who visited her without the
princes knowledge the longer she lived the more experience and
observation she had of life the greater was her wonder at the short
sightedness of men who seek enjoyment and happiness here on earth
toiling suffering struggling and harming one another to obtain that
impossible visionary sinful happiness prince andrew had loved his
wife she died but that was not enough he wanted to bind his happiness
to another woman her father objected to this because he wanted a more
distinguished and wealthier match for andrew and they all struggled and
suffered and tormented one another and injured their souls their
eternal souls for the attainment of benefits which endure but for an
instant not only do we know this ourselves but christ the son of god
came down to earth and told us that this life is but for a moment and is
a probation yet we cling to it and think to find happiness in it how
is it that no one realizes this thought princess mary no one except
these despised gods folk who wallet on back come to me by the back
door afraid of being seen by the prince not for fear of illusage by
him but for fear of causing him to sin to leave family home and all
the cares of worldly welfare in order without clinging to anything to
wander in hempen rags from place to place under an assumed name doing
no one any harm but praying for allfor those who drive one away as well
as for those who protect one higher than that life and truth there is
no life or truth

there was one pilgrim a quiet pockmarked little woman of fifty called
theodosia who for over thirty years had gone about barefoot and worn
heavy chains princess mary was particularly fond of her once when in
a room with a lamp dimly lit before the icon theodosia was talking of
her life the thought that theodosia alone had found the true path of
life suddenly came to princess mary with such force that she resolved to
become a pilgrim herself when theodosia had gone to sleep princess mary
thought about this for a long time and at last made up her mind that
strange as it might seem she must go on a pilgrimage she disclosed
this thought to no one but to her confessor father akinfi the monk
and he approved of her intention under guise of a present for the
pilgrims princess mary prepared a pilgrims complete costume for
herself a coarse smock bast shoes a rough coat and a black kerchief
often approaching the chest of drawers containing this secret treasure
princess mary paused uncertain whether the time had not already come to
put her project into execution

often listening to the pilgrims tales she was so stimulated by their
simple speech mechanical to them but to her so full of deep meaning
that several times she was on the point of abandoning everything and
running away from home in imagination she already pictured herself by
theodosias side dressed in coarse rags walking with a staff a wallet
on her back along the dusty road directing her wanderings from one
saints shrine to another free from envy earthly love or desire and
reaching at last the place where there is no more sorrow or sighing but
eternal joy and bliss

i shall come to a place and pray there and before having time to get
used to it or getting to love it i shall go farther i will go on till
my legs fail and ill lie down and die somewhere and shall at last
reach that eternal quiet haven where there is neither sorrow nor
sighing thought princess mary

but afterwards when she saw her father and especially little koko
nicholas her resolve weakened she wept quietly and felt that she
was a sinner who loved her father and little nephew more than god





book seven





chapter i

the bible legend tells us that the absence of laboridlenesswas a
condition of the first mans blessedness before the fall fallen man has
retained a love of idleness but the curse weighs on the race not only
because we have to seek our bread in the sweat of our brows but because
our moral nature is such that we cannot be both idle and at ease an
inner voice tells us we are in the wrong if we are idle if man could
find a state in which he felt that though idle he was fulfilling his
duty he would have found one of the conditions of mans primitive
blessedness and such a state of obligatory and irreproachable idleness
is the lot of a whole classthe military the chief attraction of
military service has consisted and will consist in this compulsory and
irreproachable idleness

nicholas rostóv experienced this blissful condition to the full when
after  he continued to serve in the pávlograd regiment in which he
already commanded the squadron he had taken over from denisov

rostóv had become a bluff goodnatured fellow whom his moscow
acquaintances would have considered rather bad form but who was liked
and respected by his comrades subordinates and superiors and was well
contented with his life of late in  he found in letters from home
more frequent complaints from his mother that their affairs were falling
into greater and greater disorder and that it was time for him to come
back to gladden and comfort his old parents

reading these letters nicholas felt a dread of their wanting to take
him away from surroundings in which protected from all the
entanglements of life he was living so calmly and quietly he felt that
sooner or later he would have to reenter that whirlpool of life with
its embarrassments and affairs to be straightened out its accounts with
stewards quarrels and intrigues its ties society and with sónyas
love and his promise to her it was all dreadfully difficult and
complicated and he replied to his mother in cold formal letters in
french beginning my dear mamma and ending your obedient son
which said nothing of when he would return in  he received letters
from his parents in which they told him of natáshas engagement to
bolkónski and that the wedding would be in a years time because the
old prince made difficulties this letter grieved and mortified
nicholas in the first place he was sorry that natásha for whom he
cared more than for anyone else in the family should be lost to the
home and secondly from his hussar point of view he regretted not to
have been there to show that fellow bolkónski that connection with him
was no such great honor after all and that if he loved natásha he might
dispense with permission from his dotard father for a moment he
hesitated whether he should not apply for leave in order to see natásha
before she was married but then came the maneuvers and considerations
about sónya and about the confusion of their affairs and nicholas again
put it off but in the spring of that year he received a letter from
his mother written without his fathers knowledge and that letter
persuaded him to return she wrote that if he did not come and take
matters in hand their whole property would be sold by auction and they
would all have to go begging the count was so weak and trusted mitenka
so much and was so goodnatured that everybody took advantage of him
and things were going from bad to worse for gods sake i implore you
come at once if you do not wish to make me and the whole family
wretched wrote the countess

this letter touched nicholas he had that common sense of a matterof
fact man which showed him what he ought to do

the right thing now was if not to retire from the service at any rate
to go home on leave why he had to go he did not know but after his
afterdinner nap he gave orders to saddle mars an extremely vicious
gray stallion that had not been ridden for a long time and when he
returned with the horse all in a lather he informed lavrushka
denisovs servant who had remained with him and his comrades who
turned up in the evening that he was applying for leave and was going
home difficult and strange as it was for him to reflect that he would
go away without having heard from the staffand this interested him
extremelywhether he was promoted to a captaincy or would receive the
order of st anne for the last maneuvers strange as it was to think
that he would go away without having sold his three roans to the polish
count golukhovski who was bargaining for the horses rostóv had betted
he would sell for two thousand rubles incomprehensible as it seemed
that the ball the hussars were giving in honor of the polish
mademoiselle przazdziecka out of rivalry to the uhlans who had given
one in honor of their polish mademoiselle borzozowska would take place
without himhe knew he must go away from this good bright world to
somewhere where everything was stupid and confused a week later he
obtained his leave his hussar comradesnot only those of his own
regiment but the whole brigadegave rostóv a dinner to which the
subscription was fifteen rubles a head and at which there were two
bands and two choirs of singers rostóv danced the trepak with major
basov the tipsy officers tossed embraced and dropped rostóv the
soldiers of the third squadron tossed him too and shouted hurrah and
then they put him in his sleigh and escorted him as far as the first
post station

during the first half of the journeyfrom kremenchug to kievall
rostóvs thoughts as is usual in such cases were behind him with the
squadron but when he had gone more than halfway he began to forget his
three roans and dozhoyveyko his quartermaster and to wonder anxiously
how things would be at otradnoe and what he would find there thoughts
of home grew stronger the nearer he approached itfar stronger as
though this feeling of his was subject to the law by which the force of
attraction is in inverse proportion to the square of the distance at
the last post station before otradnoe he gave the driver a threeruble
tip and on arriving he ran breathlessly like a boy up the steps of
his home

after the rapture of meeting and after that odd feeling of unsatisfied
expectationthe feeling that everything is just the same so why did i
hurrynicholas began to settle down in his old home world his father
and mother were much the same only a little older what was new in them
was a certain uneasiness and occasional discord which there used not to
be and which as nicholas soon found out was due to the bad state of
their affairs sónya was nearly twenty she had stopped growing prettier
and promised nothing more than she was already but that was enough she
exhaled happiness and love from the time nicholas returned and the
faithful unalterable love of this girl had a gladdening effect on him
pétya and natásha surprised nicholas most pétya was a big handsome boy
of thirteen merry witty and mischievous with a voice that was
already breaking as for natásha for a long while nicholas wondered and
laughed whenever he looked at her

youre not the same at all he said

how am i uglier

on the contrary but what dignity a princess he whispered to her

yes yes yes cried natásha joyfully

she told him about her romance with prince andrew and of his visit to
otradnoe and showed him his last letter

well are you glad natásha asked i am so tranquil and happy now

very glad answered nicholas he is an excellent fellow and are
you very much in love

how shall i put it replied natásha i was in love with borís with
my teacher and with denisov but this is quite different i feel at
peace and settled i know that no better man than he exists and i am
calm and contented now not at all as before

nicholas expressed his disapproval of the postponement of the marriage
for a year but natásha attacked her brother with exasperation proving
to him that it could not be otherwise and that it would be a bad thing
to enter a family against the fathers will and that she herself wished
it so

you dont at all understand she said

nicholas was silent and agreed with her

her brother often wondered as he looked at her she did not seem at all
like a girl in love and parted from her affianced husband she was even
tempered and calm and quite as cheerful as of old this amazed nicholas
and even made him regard bolkónskis courtship skeptically he could not
believe that her fate was sealed especially as he had not seen her with
prince andrew it always seemed to him that there was something not
quite right about this intended marriage

why this delay why no betrothal he thought once when he had
touched on this topic with his mother he discovered to his surprise
and somewhat to his satisfaction that in the depth of her soul she too
had doubts about this marriage

you see he writes said she showing her son a letter of prince
andrews with that latent grudge a mother always has in regard to a
daughters future married happiness he writes that he wont come
before december what can be keeping him illness probably his health
is very delicate dont tell natásha and dont attach importance to her
being so bright thats because shes living through the last days of
her girlhood but i know what she is like every time we receive a letter
from him however god grant that everything turns out well she
always ended with these words he is an excellent man





chapter ii

after reaching home nicholas was at first serious and even dull he was
worried by the impending necessity of interfering in the stupid business
matters for which his mother had called him home to throw off this
burden as quickly as possible on the third day after his arrival he
went angry and scowling and without answering questions as to where he
was going to mitenkas lodge and demanded an account of everything but
what an account of everything might be nicholas knew even less than the
frightened and bewildered mitenka the conversation and the examination
of the accounts with mitenka did not last long the village elder a
peasant delegate and the village clerk who were waiting in the
passage heard with fear and delight first the young counts voice
roaring and snapping and rising louder and louder and then words of
abuse dreadful words ejaculated one after the other

robber ungrateful wretch ill hack the dog to pieces im not
my father robbing us and so on

then with no less fear and delight they saw how the young count red in
the face and with bloodshot eyes dragged mitenka out by the scruff of
the neck and applied his foot and knee to his behind with great agility
at convenient moments between the words shouting be off never let me
see your face here again you villain

mitenka flew headlong down the six steps and ran away into the
shrubbery this shrubbery was a wellknown haven of refuge for culprits
at otradnoe mitenka himself returning tipsy from the town used to
hide there and many of the residents at otradnoe hiding from mitenka
knew of its protective qualities

mitenkas wife and sistersinlaw thrust their heads and frightened
faces out of the door of a room where a bright samovar was boiling and
where the stewards high bedstead stood with its patchwork quilt

the young count paid no heed to them but breathing hard passed by
with resolute strides and went into the house

the countess who heard at once from the maids what had happened at the
lodge was calmed by the thought that now their affairs would certainly
improve but on the other hand felt anxious as to the effect this
excitement might have on her son she went several times to his door on
tiptoe and listened as he lighted one pipe after another

next day the old count called his son aside and with an embarrassed
smile said to him

but you know my dear boy its a pity you got excited mitenka has
told me all about it

i knew thought nicholas that i should never understand anything in
this crazy world

you were angry that he had not entered those  rubles but they were
carried forwardand you did not look at the other page

papa he is a blackguard and a thief i know he is and what i have
done i have done but if you like i wont speak to him again

no my dear boy the count too felt embarrassed he knew he had
mismanaged his wifes property and was to blame toward his children but
he did not know how to remedy it no i beg you to attend to the
business i am old i

no papa forgive me if i have caused you unpleasantness i understand
it all less than you do

devil take all these peasants and money matters and carryings forward
from page to page he thought i used to understand what a corner
and the stakes at cards meant but carrying forward to another page i
dont understand at all said he to himself and after that he did not
meddle in business affairs but once the countess called her son and
informed him that she had a promissory note from anna mikháylovna for
two thousand rubles and asked him what he thought of doing with it

this answered nicholas you say it rests with me well i dont like
anna mikháylovna and i dont like borís but they were our friends and
poor well then this and he tore up the note and by so doing caused
the old countess to weep tears of joy after that young rostóv took no
further part in any business affairs but devoted himself with
passionate enthusiasm to what was to him a new pursuitthe chasefor
which his father kept a large establishment





chapter iii

the weather was already growing wintry and morning frosts congealed an
earth saturated by autumn rains the verdure had thickened and its
bright green stood out sharply against the brownish strips of winter rye
trodden down by the cattle and against the paleyellow stubble of the
spring buckwheat the wooded ravines and the copses which at the end of
august had still been green islands amid black fields and stubble had
become golden and brightred islands amid the green winter rye the
hares had already half changed their summer coats the fox cubs were
beginning to scatter and the young wolves were bigger than dogs it was
the best time of the year for the chase the hounds of that ardent young
sportsman rostóv had not merely reached hard winter condition but were
so jaded that at a meeting of the huntsmen it was decided to give them a
three days rest and then on the sixteenth of september to go on a
distant expedition starting from the oak grove where there was an
undisturbed litter of wolf cubs

all that day the hounds remained at home it was frosty and the air was
sharp but toward evening the sky became overcast and it began to thaw
on the fifteenth when young rostóv in his dressing gown looked out of
the window he saw it was an unsurpassable morning for hunting it was
as if the sky were melting and sinking to the earth without any wind
the only motion in the air was that of the dripping microscopic
particles of drizzling mist the bare twigs in the garden were hung with
transparent drops which fell on the freshly fallen leaves the earth in
the kitchen garden looked wet and black and glistened like poppy seed
and at a short distance merged into the dull moist veil of mist
nicholas went out into the wet and muddy porch there was a smell of
decaying leaves and of dog milka a blackspotted broadhaunched bitch
with prominent black eyes got up on seeing her master stretched her
hind legs lay down like a hare and then suddenly jumped up and licked
him right on his nose and mustache another borzoi a dog catching
sight of his master from the garden path arched his back and rushing
headlong toward the porch with lifted tail began rubbing himself
against his legs

ohoy came at that moment that inimitable huntsmans call which
unites the deepest bass with the shrillest tenor and round the corner
came daniel the head huntsman and head kennelman a gray wrinkled old
man with hair cut straight over his forehead ukrainian fashion a long
bent whip in his hand and that look of independence and scorn of
everything that is only seen in huntsmen he doffed his circassian cap
to his master and looked at him scornfully this scorn was not offensive
to his master nicholas knew that this daniel disdainful of everybody
and who considered himself above them was all the same his serf and
huntsman

daniel nicholas said timidly conscious at the sight of the weather
the hounds and the huntsman that he was being carried away by that
irresistible passion for sport which makes a man forget all his previous
resolutions as a lover forgets in the presence of his mistress

what orders your excellency said the huntsman in his deep bass deep
as a protodeacons and hoarse with hallooingand two flashing black
eyes gazed from under his brows at his master who was silent can you
resist it those eyes seemed to be asking

its a good day eh for a hunt and a gallop eh asked nicholas
scratching milka behind the ears

daniel did not answer but winked instead

i sent uvarka at dawn to listen his bass boomed out after a minutes
pause he says shes moved them into the otradnoe enclosure they were
howling there this meant that the shewolf about whom they both
knew had moved with her cubs to the otradnoe copse a small place a
mile and a half from the house

we ought to go dont you think so said nicholas come to me with
uvarka

as you please

then put off feeding them

yes sir

five minutes later daniel and uvarka were standing in nicholas big
study though daniel was not a big man to see him in a room was like
seeing a horse or a bear on the floor among the furniture and
surroundings of human life daniel himself felt this and as usual stood
just inside the door trying to speak softly and not move for fear of
breaking something in the masters apartment and he hastened to say all
that was necessary so as to get from under that ceiling out into the
open under the sky once more

having finished his inquiries and extorted from daniel an opinion that
the hounds were fit daniel himself wished to go hunting nicholas
ordered the horses to be saddled but just as daniel was about to go
natásha came in with rapid steps not having done up her hair or
finished dressing and with her old nurses big shawl wrapped round her
pétya ran in at the same time

you are going asked natásha i knew you would sónya said you
wouldnt go but i knew that today is the sort of day when you couldnt
help going

yes we are going replied nicholas reluctantly for today as he
intended to hunt seriously he did not want to take natásha and pétya
we are going but only wolf hunting it would be dull for you

you know it is my greatest pleasure said natásha its not fair you
are going by yourself are having the horses saddled and said nothing to
us about it

no barrier bars a russians pathwell go shouted pétya

but you cant mamma said you mustnt said nicholas to natásha

yes ill go i shall certainly go said natásha decisively daniel
tell them to saddle for us and michael must come with my dogs she
added to the huntsman

it seemed to daniel irksome and improper to be in a room at all but to
have anything to do with a young lady seemed to him impossible he cast
down his eyes and hurried out as if it were none of his business
careful as he went not to inflict any accidental injury on the young
lady





chapter iv

the old count who had always kept up an enormous hunting establishment
but had now handed it all completely over to his sons care being in
very good spirits on this fifteenth of september prepared to go out
with the others

in an hours time the whole hunting party was at the porch nicholas
with a stern and serious air which showed that now was no time for
attending to trifles went past natásha and pétya who were trying to
tell him something he had a look at all the details of the hunt sent a
pack of hounds and huntsmen on ahead to find the quarry mounted his
chestnut donets and whistling to his own leash of borzois set off
across the threshing ground to a field leading to the otradnoe wood the
old counts horse a sorrel gelding called viflyanka was led by the
groom in attendance on him while the count himself was to drive in a
small trap straight to a spot reserved for him

they were taking fiftyfour hounds with six hunt attendants and
whippersin besides the family there were eight borzoi kennelmen and
more than forty borzois so that with the borzois on the leash
belonging to members of the family there were about a hundred and
thirty dogs and twenty horsemen

each dog knew its master and its call each man in the hunt knew his
business his place what he had to do as soon as they had passed the
fence they all spread out evenly and quietly without noise or talk
along the road and field leading to the otradnoe covert

the horses stepped over the field as over a thick carpet now and then
splashing into puddles as they crossed a road the misty sky still
seemed to descend evenly and imperceptibly toward the earth the air was
still warm and silent occasionally the whistle of a huntsman the
snort of a horse the crack of a whip or the whine of a straggling
hound could be heard

when they had gone a little less than a mile five more riders with dogs
appeared out of the mist approaching the rostóvs in front rode a
freshlooking handsome old man with a large gray mustache

good morning uncle said nicholas when the old man drew near

thats it come on i was sure of it began uncle he was a
distant relative of the rostóvs a man of small means and their
neighbor i knew you wouldnt be able to resist it and its a good
thing youre going thats it come on this was uncles favorite
expression take the covert at once for my girchik says the ilagins
are at korniki with their hounds thats it come on theyll take
the cubs from under your very nose

thats where im going shall we join up our packs asked nicholas

the hounds were joined into one pack and uncle and nicholas rode on
side by side natásha muffled up in shawls which did not hide her eager
face and shining eyes galloped up to them she was followed by pétya
who always kept close to her by michael a huntsman and by a groom
appointed to look after her pétya who was laughing whipped and pulled
at his horse natásha sat easily and confidently on her black arabchik
and reined him in without effort with a firm hand

uncle looked round disapprovingly at pétya and natásha he did not
like to combine frivolity with the serious business of hunting

good morning uncle we are going too shouted pétya

good morning good morning but dont go overriding the hounds said
uncle sternly

nicholas what a fine dog trunila is he knew me said natásha
referring to her favorite hound

in the first place trunila is not a dog but a harrier thought
nicholas and looked sternly at his sister trying to make her feel the
distance that ought to separate them at that moment natásha understood
it

you mustnt think well be in anyones way uncle she said well go
to our places and wont budge

a good thing too little countess said uncle only mind you dont
fall off your horse he added becausethats it come onyouve
nothing to hold on to

the oasis of the otradnoe covert came in sight a few hundred yards off
the huntsmen were already nearing it rostóv having finally settled
with uncle where they should set on the hounds and having shown
natásha where she was to standa spot where nothing could possibly run
outwent round above the ravine

well nephew youre going for a big wolf said uncle mind and
dont let her slip

thats as may happen answered rostóv karay here he shouted
answering uncles remark by this call to his borzoi karay was a
shaggy old dog with a hanging jowl famous for having tackled a big wolf
unaided they all took up their places

the old count knowing his sons ardor in the hunt hurried so as not to
be late and the huntsmen had not yet reached their places when count
ilyá rostóv cheerful flushed and with quivering cheeks drove up with
his black horses over the winter rye to the place reserved for him
where a wolf might come out having straightened his coat and fastened
on his hunting knives and horn he mounted his good sleek wellfed
and comfortable horse viflyanka which was turning gray like himself
his horses and trap were sent home count ilyá rostóv though not at
heart a keen sportsman knew the rules of the hunt well and rode to the
bushy edge of the road where he was to stand arranged his reins
settled himself in the saddle and feeling that he was ready looked
about with a smile

beside him was simon chekmar his personal attendant an old horseman
now somewhat stiff in the saddle chekmar held in leash three formidable
wolfhounds who had however grown fat like their master and his horse
two wise old dogs lay down unleashed some hundred paces farther along
the edge of the wood stood mitka the counts other groom a daring
horseman and keen rider to hounds before the hunt by old custom the
count had drunk a silver cupful of mulled brandy taken a snack and
washed it down with half a bottle of his favorite bordeaux

he was somewhat flushed with the wine and the drive his eyes were
rather moist and glittered more than usual and as he sat in his saddle
wrapped up in his fur coat he looked like a child taken out for an
outing

the thin hollowcheeked chekmar having got everything ready kept
glancing at his master with whom he had lived on the best of terms for
thirty years and understanding the mood he was in expected a pleasant
chat a third person rode up circumspectly through the wood it was
plain that he had had a lesson and stopped behind the count this
person was a graybearded old man in a womans cloak with a tall peaked
cap on his head he was the buffoon who went by a womans name
nastasya ivánovna

well nastasya ivánovna whispered the count winking at him if you
scare away the beast danielll give it you

i know a thing or two myself said nastasya ivánovna

hush whispered the count and turned to simon have you seen the
young countess he asked where is she

with young count peter by the zharov rank grass answered simon
smiling though shes a lady shes very fond of hunting

and youre surprised at the way she rides simon eh said the count
shes as good as many a man

of course its marvelous so bold so easy

and nicholas where is he by the lyadov upland isnt he

yes sir he knows where to stand he understands the matter so well
that daniel and i are often quite astounded said simon well knowing
what would please his master

rides well eh and how well he looks on his horse eh

a perfect picture how he chased a fox out of the rank grass by the
zavarzinsk thicket the other day leaped a fearful place what a sight
when they rushed from the covert the horse worth a thousand rubles
and the rider beyond all price yes one would have to search far to
find another as smart

to search far repeated the count evidently sorry simon had not
said more to search far he said turning back the skirt of his coat
to get at his snuffbox

the other day when he came out from mass in full uniform michael
sidorych simon did not finish for on the still air he had
distinctly caught the music of the hunt with only two or three hounds
giving tongue he bent down his head and listened shaking a warning
finger at his master they are on the scent of the cubs he
whispered straight to the lyadov uplands

the count forgetting to smooth out the smile on his face looked into
the distance straight before him down the narrow open space holding
the snuffbox in his hand but not taking any after the cry of the hounds
came the deep tones of the wolf call from daniels hunting horn the
pack joined the first three hounds and they could be heard in full cry
with that peculiar lift in the note that indicates that they are after a
wolf the whippersin no longer set on the hounds but changed to the
cry of ulyulyu and above the others rose daniels voice now a deep
bass now piercingly shrill his voice seemed to fill the whole wood and
carried far beyond out into the open field

after listening a few moments in silence the count and his attendant
convinced themselves that the hounds had separated into two packs the
sound of the larger pack eagerly giving tongue began to die away in
the distance the other pack rushed by the wood past the count and it
was with this that daniels voice was heard calling ulyulyu the sounds
of both packs mingled and broke apart again but both were becoming more
distant

simon sighed and stooped to straighten the leash a young borzoi had
entangled the count too sighed and noticing the snuffbox in his hand
opened it and took a pinch back cried simon to a borzoi that was
pushing forward out of the wood the count started and dropped the
snuffbox nastasya ivánovna dismounted to pick it up the count and
simon were looking at him

then unexpectedly as often happens the sound of the hunt suddenly
approached as if the hounds in full cry and daniel ulyulyuing were just
in front of them

the count turned and saw on his right mitka staring at him with eyes
starting out of his head raising his cap and pointing before him to the
other side

look out he shouted in a voice plainly showing that he had long
fretted to utter that word and letting the borzois slip he galloped
toward the count

the count and simon galloped out of the wood and saw on their left a
wolf which softly swaying from side to side was coming at a quiet lope
farther to the left to the very place where they were standing the
angry borzois whined and getting free of the leash rushed past the
horses feet at the wolf

the wolf paused turned its heavy forehead toward the dogs awkwardly
like a man suffering from the quinsy and still slightly swaying from
side to side gave a couple of leaps and with a swish of its tail
disappeared into the skirt of the wood at the same instant with a cry
like a wail first one hound then another and then another sprang
helterskelter from the wood opposite and the whole pack rushed across
the field toward the very spot where the wolf had disappeared the hazel
bushes parted behind the hounds and daniels chestnut horse appeared
dark with sweat on its long back sat daniel hunched forward capless
his disheveled gray hair hanging over his flushed perspiring face

ulyulyulyu ulyulyu he cried when he caught sight of the count
his eyes flashed lightning

blast you he shouted holding up his whip threateningly at the count

youve let the wolf go what sportsmen and as if scorning to say
more to the frightened and shamefaced count he lashed the heaving
flanks of his sweating chestnut gelding with all the anger the count had
aroused and flew off after the hounds the count like a punished
schoolboy looked round trying by a smile to win simons sympathy for
his plight but simon was no longer there he was galloping round by the
bushes while the field was coming up on both sides all trying to head
the wolf but it vanished into the wood before they could do so





chapter v

nicholas rostóv meanwhile remained at his post waiting for the wolf by
the way the hunt approached and receded by the cries of the dogs whose
notes were familiar to him by the way the voices of the huntsmen
approached receded and rose he realized what was happening at the
copse he knew that young and old wolves were there that the hounds had
separated into two packs that somewhere a wolf was being chased and
that something had gone wrong he expected the wolf to come his way any
moment he made thousands of different conjectures as to where and from
what side the beast would come and how he would set upon it hope
alternated with despair several times he addressed a prayer to god that
the wolf should come his way he prayed with that passionate and
shamefaced feeling with which men pray at moments of great excitement
arising from trivial causes what would it be to thee to do this for
me he said to god i know thou art great and that it is a sin to ask
this of thee but for gods sake do let the old wolf come my way and let
karay spring at itin sight of uncle who is watching from over
thereand seize it by the throat in a death grip a thousand times
during that halfhour rostóv cast eager and restless glances over the
edge of the wood with the two scraggy oaks rising above the aspen
undergrowth and the gully with its waterworn side and uncles cap
just visible above the bush on his right

no i shant have such luck thought rostóv yet what wouldnt it be
worth it is not to be everywhere at cards and in war i am always
unlucky memories of austerlitz and of dólokhov flashed rapidly and
clearly through his mind only once in my life to get an old wolf i
want only that thought he straining eyes and ears and looking to the
left and then to the right and listening to the slightest variation of
note in the cries of the dogs

again he looked to the right and saw something running toward him across
the deserted field no it cant be thought rostóv taking a deep
breath as a man does at the coming of something long hoped for the
height of happiness was reachedand so simply without warning or
noise or display that rostóv could not believe his eyes and remained
in doubt for over a second the wolf ran forward and jumped heavily over
a gully that lay in her path she was an old animal with a gray back and
big reddish belly she ran without hurry evidently feeling sure that no
one saw her rostóv holding his breath looked round at the borzois
they stood or lay not seeing the wolf or understanding the situation
old karay had turned his head and was angrily searching for fleas
baring his yellow teeth and snapping at his hind legs

ulyulyulyu whispered rostóv pouting his lips the borzois jumped up
jerking the rings of the leashes and pricking their ears karay finished
scratching his hindquarters and cocking his ears got up with quivering
tail from which tufts of matted hair hung down

shall i loose them or not nicholas asked himself as the wolf
approached him coming from the copse suddenly the wolfs whole
physiognomy changed she shuddered seeing what she had probably never
seen beforehuman eyes fixed upon herand turning her head a little
toward rostóv she paused

back or forward eh no matter forward the wolf seemed to say to
herself and she moved forward without again looking round and with a
quiet long easy yet resolute lope

ulyulyu cried nicholas in a voice not his own and of its own accord
his good horse darted headlong downhill leaping over gullies to head
off the wolf and the borzois passed it running faster still nicholas
did not hear his own cry nor feel that he was galloping nor see the
borzois nor the ground over which he went he saw only the wolf who
increasing her speed bounded on in the same direction along the hollow
the first to come into view was milka with her black markings and
powerful quarters gaining upon the wolf nearer and nearer now she
was ahead of it but the wolf turned its head to face her and instead
of putting on speed as she usually did milka suddenly raised her tail
and stiffened her forelegs

ulyulyulyulyu shouted nicholas

the reddish lyubim rushed forward from behind milka sprang impetuously
at the wolf and seized it by its hindquarters but immediately jumped
aside in terror the wolf crouched gnashed her teeth and again rose
and bounded forward followed at the distance of a couple of feet by all
the borzois who did not get any closer to her

shell get away no its impossible thought nicholas still shouting
with a hoarse voice

karay ulyulyu he shouted looking round for the old borzoi who
was now his only hope karay with all the strength age had left him
stretched himself to the utmost and watching the wolf galloped heavily
aside to intercept it but the quickness of the wolfs lope and the
borzois slower pace made it plain that karay had miscalculated
nicholas could already see not far in front of him the wood where the
wolf would certainly escape should she reach it but coming toward him
he saw hounds and a huntsman galloping almost straight at the wolf
there was still hope a long yellowish young borzoi one nicholas did
not know from another leash rushed impetuously at the wolf from in
front and almost knocked her over but the wolf jumped up more quickly
than anyone could have expected and gnashing her teeth flew at the
yellowish borzoi which with a piercing yelp fell with its head on the
ground bleeding from a gash in its side

karay old fellow wailed nicholas

thanks to the delay caused by this crossing of the wolfs path the old
dog with its felted hair hanging from its thigh was within five paces of
it as if aware of her danger the wolf turned her eyes on karay tucked
her tail yet further between her legs and increased her speed but here
nicholas only saw that something happened to karaythe borzoi was
suddenly on the wolf and they rolled together down into a gully just in
front of them

that instant when nicholas saw the wolf struggling in the gully with
the dogs while from under them could be seen her gray hair and
outstretched hind leg and her frightened choking head with her ears
laid back karay was pinning her by the throat was the happiest moment
of his life with his hand on his saddlebow he was ready to dismount
and stab the wolf when she suddenly thrust her head up from among that
mass of dogs and then her forepaws were on the edge of the gully she
clicked her teeth karay no longer had her by the throat leaped with a
movement of her hind legs out of the gully and having disengaged
herself from the dogs with tail tucked in again went forward karay
his hair bristling and probably bruised or wounded climbed with
difficulty out of the gully

oh my god why nicholas cried in despair

uncles huntsman was galloping from the other side across the wolfs
path and his borzois once more stopped the animals advance she was
again hemmed in

nicholas and his attendant with uncle and his huntsman were all
riding round the wolf crying ulyulyu shouting and preparing to
dismount each moment that the wolf crouched back and starting forward
again every time she shook herself and moved toward the wood where she
would be safe

already at the beginning of this chase daniel hearing the ulyulyuing
had rushed out from the wood he saw karay seize the wolf and checked
his horse supposing the affair to be over but when he saw that the
horsemen did not dismount and that the wolf shook herself and ran for
safety daniel set his chestnut galloping not at the wolf but straight
toward the wood just as karay had run to cut the animal off as a
result of this he galloped up to the wolf just when she had been
stopped a second time by uncles borzois

daniel galloped up silently holding a naked dagger in his left hand and
thrashing the laboring sides of his chestnut horse with his whip as if
it were a flail

nicholas neither saw nor heard daniel until the chestnut breathing
heavily panted past him and he heard the fall of a body and saw daniel
lying on the wolfs back among the dogs trying to seize her by the
ears it was evident to the dogs the hunters and to the wolf herself
that all was now over the terrified wolf pressed back her ears and
tried to rise but the borzois stuck to her daniel rose a little took
a step and with his whole weight as if lying down to rest fell on the
wolf seizing her by the ears nicholas was about to stab her but
daniel whispered dont well gag her and changing his position
set his foot on the wolfs neck a stick was thrust between her jaws and
she was fastened with a leash as if bridled her legs were bound
together and daniel rolled her over once or twice from side to side

with happy exhausted faces they laid the old wolf alive on a shying
and snorting horse and accompanied by the dogs yelping at her took her
to the place where they were all to meet the hounds had killed two of
the cubs and the borzois three the huntsmen assembled with their booty
and their stories and all came to look at the wolf which with her
broadbrowed head hanging down and the bitten stick between her jaws
gazed with great glassy eyes at this crowd of dogs and men surrounding
her when she was touched she jerked her bound legs and looked wildly
yet simply at everybody old count rostóv also rode up and touched the
wolf

oh what a formidable one said he a formidable one eh he asked
daniel who was standing near

yes your excellency answered daniel quickly doffing his cap

the count remembered the wolf he had let slip and his encounter with
daniel

ah but you are a crusty fellow friend said the count

for sole reply daniel gave him a shy childlike meek and amiable
smile





chapter vi

the old count went home and natásha and pétya promised to return very
soon but as it was still early the hunt went farther at midday they
put the hounds into a ravine thickly overgrown with young trees
nicholas standing in a fallow field could see all his whips

facing him lay a field of winter rye there his own huntsman stood alone
in a hollow behind a hazel bush the hounds had scarcely been loosed
before nicholas heard one he knew voltorn giving tongue at intervals
other hounds joined in now pausing and now again giving tongue a
moment later he heard a cry from the wooded ravine that a fox had been
found and the whole pack joining together rushed along the ravine
toward the ryefield and away from nicholas

he saw the whips in their red caps galloping along the edge of the
ravine he even saw the hounds and was expecting a fox to show itself
at any moment on the ryefield opposite

the huntsman standing in the hollow moved and loosed his borzois and
nicholas saw a queer shortlegged red fox with a fine brush going hard
across the field the borzois bore down on it now they drew close to
the fox which began to dodge between the field in sharper and sharper
curves trailing its brush when suddenly a strange white borzoi dashed
in followed by a black one and everything was in confusion the borzois
formed a starshaped figure scarcely swaying their bodies and with
tails turned away from the center of the group two huntsmen galloped up
to the dogs one in a red cap the other a stranger in a green coat

whats this thought nicholas wheres that huntsman from he is not
uncles man

the huntsmen got the fox but stayed there a long time without strapping
it to the saddle their horses bridled and with high saddles stood
near them and there too the dogs were lying the huntsmen waved their
arms and did something to the fox then from that spot came the sound of
a horn with the signal agreed on in case of a fight

thats ilagins huntsman having a row with our ivan said nicholas
groom

nicholas sent the man to call natásha and pétya to him and rode at a
footpace to the place where the whips were getting the hounds together
several of the field galloped to the spot where the fight was going on

nicholas dismounted and with natásha and pétya who had ridden up
stopped near the hounds waiting to see how the matter would end out of
the bushes came the huntsman who had been fighting and rode toward his
young master with the fox tied to his crupper while still at a
distance he took off his cap and tried to speak respectfully but he was
pale and breathless and his face was angry one of his eyes was black
but he probably was not even aware of it

what has happened asked nicholas

a likely thing killing a fox our dogs had hunted and it was my gray
bitch that caught it go to law indeed he snatches at the fox i
gave him one with the fox here it is on my saddle do you want a taste
of this said the huntsman pointing to his dagger and probably
imagining himself still speaking to his foe

nicholas not stopping to talk to the man asked his sister and pétya to
wait for him and rode to the spot where the enemys ilagins hunting
party was

the victorious huntsman rode off to join the field and there
surrounded by inquiring sympathizers recounted his exploits

the facts were that ilagin with whom the rostóvs had a quarrel and were
at law hunted over places that belonged by custom to the rostóvs and
had now as if purposely sent his men to the very woods the rostóvs
were hunting and let his man snatch a fox their dogs had chased

nicholas though he had never seen ilagin with his usual absence of
moderation in judgment hated him cordially from reports of his
arbitrariness and violence and regarded him as his bitterest foe he
rode in angry agitation toward him firmly grasping his whip and fully
prepared to take the most resolute and desperate steps to punish his
enemy

hardly had he passed an angle of the wood before a stout gentleman in a
beaver cap came riding toward him on a handsome ravenblack horse
accompanied by two hunt servants

instead of an enemy nicholas found in ilagin a stately and courteous
gentleman who was particularly anxious to make the young counts
acquaintance having ridden up to nicholas ilagin raised his beaver cap
and said he much regretted what had occurred and would have the man
punished who had allowed himself to seize a fox hunted by someone elses
borzois he hoped to become better acquainted with the count and invited
him to draw his covert

natásha afraid that her brother would do something dreadful had
followed him in some excitement seeing the enemies exchanging friendly
greetings she rode up to them ilagin lifted his beaver cap still
higher to natásha and said with a pleasant smile that the young
countess resembled diana in her passion for the chase as well as in her
beauty of which he had heard much

to expiate his huntsmans offense ilagin pressed the rostóvs to come to
an upland of his about a mile away which he usually kept for himself and
which he said swarmed with hares nicholas agreed and the hunt now
doubled moved on

the way to iligins upland was across the fields the hunt servants fell
into line the masters rode together uncle rostóv and ilagin kept
stealthily glancing at one anothers dogs trying not to be observed by
their companions and searching uneasily for rivals to their own borzois

rostóv was particularly struck by the beauty of a small purebred red
spotted bitch on ilagins leash slender but with muscles like steel a
delicate muzzle and prominent black eyes he had heard of the swiftness
of ilagins borzois and in that beautiful bitch saw a rival to his own
milka

in the middle of a sober conversation begun by ilagin about the years
harvest nicholas pointed to the redspotted bitch

a fine little bitch that said he in a careless tone is she swift

that one yes shes a good dog gets what shes after answered
ilagin indifferently of the redspotted bitch erza for which a year
before he had given a neighbor three families of house serfs so in
your parts too the harvest is nothing to boast of count he went on
continuing the conversation they had begun and considering it polite to
return the young counts compliment ilagin looked at his borzois and
picked out milka who attracted his attention by her breadth that
blackspotted one of yours is finewell shaped said he

yes shes fast enough replied nicholas and thought if only a
fullgrown hare would cross the field now id show you what sort of
borzoi she is and turning to his groom he said he would give a ruble
to anyone who found a hare

i dont understand continued ilagin how some sportsmen can be so
jealous about game and dogs for myself i can tell you count i enjoy
riding in company such as this what could be better he again
raised his cap to natásha but as for counting skins and what one
takes i dont care about that

of course not

or being upset because someone elses borzoi and not mine catches
something all i care about is to enjoy seeing the chase is it not so
count for i consider that

atu came the longdrawn cry of one of the borzoi whippersin who
had halted he stood on a knoll in the stubble holding his whip aloft
and again repeated his longdrawn cry atu this call and the
uplifted whip meant that he saw a sitting hare

ah he has found one i think said ilagin carelessly yes we must
ride up shall we both course it answered nicholas seeing in erza
and uncles red rugay two rivals he had never yet had a chance of
pitting against his own borzois and suppose they outdo my milka at
once he thought as he rode with uncle and ilagin toward the hare

a fullgrown one asked ilagin as he approached the whip who had
sighted the hareand not without agitation he looked round and whistled
to erza

and you michael nikanorovich he said addressing uncle

the latter was riding with a sullen expression on his face

how can i join in why youve given a village for each of your
borzois thats it come on yours are worth thousands try yours
against one another you two and ill look on

rugay hey hey he shouted rugayushka he added involuntarily by
this diminutive expressing his affection and the hopes he placed on this
red borzoi natásha saw and felt the agitation the two elderly men and
her brother were trying to conceal and was herself excited by it

the huntsman stood halfway up the knoll holding up his whip and the
gentlefolk rode up to him at a footpace the hounds that were far off on
the horizon turned away from the hare and the whips but not the
gentlefolk also moved away all were moving slowly and sedately

how is it pointing asked nicholas riding a hundred paces toward the
whip who had sighted the hare

but before the whip could reply the hare scenting the frost coming
next morning was unable to rest and leaped up the pack on leash rushed
downhill in full cry after the hare and from all sides the borzois that
were not on leash darted after the hounds and the hare all the hunt
who had been moving slowly shouted stop calling in the hounds
while the borzoi whips with a cry of atu galloped across the field
setting the borzois on the hare the tranquil ilagin nicholas natásha
and uncle flew reckless of where and how they went seeing only the
borzois and the hare and fearing only to lose sight even for an instant
of the chase the hare they had started was a strong and swift one when
he jumped up he did not run at once but pricked his ears listening to
the shouting and trampling that resounded from all sides at once he
took a dozen bounds not very quickly letting the borzois gain on him
and finally having chosen his direction and realized his danger laid
back his ears and rushed off headlong he had been lying in the stubble
but in front of him was the autumn sowing where the ground was soft the
two borzois of the huntsman who had sighted him having been the
nearest were the first to see and pursue him but they had not gone far
before ilagins redspotted erza passed them got within a length flew
at the hare with terrible swiftness aiming at his scut and thinking
she had seized him rolled over like a ball the hare arched his back
and bounded off yet more swiftly from behind erza rushed the broad
haunched blackspotted milka and began rapidly gaining on the hare

milashka dear rose nicholas triumphant cry it looked as if milka
would immediately pounce on the hare but she overtook him and flew
past the hare had squatted again the beautiful erza reached him but
when close to the hares scut paused as if measuring the distance so as
not to make a mistake this time but seize his hind leg

erza darling ilagin wailed in a voice unlike his own erza did not
hearken to his appeal at the very moment when she would have seized her
prey the hare moved and darted along the balk between the winter rye
and the stubble again erza and milka were abreast running like a pair
of carriage horses and began to overtake the hare but it was easier
for the hare to run on the balk and the borzois did not overtake him so
quickly

rugay rugayushka thats it come on came a third voice just then
and uncles red borzoi straining and curving its back caught up with
the two foremost borzois pushed ahead of them regardless of the
terrible strain put on speed close to the hare knocked it off the balk
onto the ryefield again put on speed still more viciously sinking to
his knees in the muddy field and all one could see was how muddying
his back he rolled over with the hare a ring of borzois surrounded
him a moment later everyone had drawn up round the crowd of dogs only
the delighted uncle dismounted and cut off a pad shaking the hare
for the blood to drip off and anxiously glancing round with restless
eyes while his arms and legs twitched he spoke without himself knowing
whom to or what about thats it come on thats a dog there it
has beaten them all the thousandruble as well as the oneruble
borzois thats it come on said he panting and looking wrathfully
around as if he were abusing someone as if they were all his enemies
and had insulted him and only now had he at last succeeded in
justifying himself there are your thousandruble ones thats it
come on

rugay heres a pad for you he said throwing down the hares muddy
pad youve deserved it thats it come on

shed tired herself out shed run it down three times by herself
said nicholas also not listening to anyone and regardless of whether he
were heard or not

but what is there in running across it like that said ilagins groom

once she had missed it and turned it away any mongrel could take it
ilagin was saying at the same time breathless from his gallop and his
excitement at the same moment natásha without drawing breath screamed
joyously ecstatically and so piercingly that it set everyones ear
tingling by that shriek she expressed what the others expressed by all
talking at once and it was so strange that she must herself have been
ashamed of so wild a cry and everyone else would have been amazed at it
at any other time uncle himself twisted up the hare threw it neatly
and smartly across his horses back as if by that gesture he meant to
rebuke everybody and with an air of not wishing to speak to anyone
mounted his bay and rode off the others all followed dispirited and
shamefaced and only much later were they able to regain their former
affectation of indifference for a long time they continued to look at
red rugay who his arched back spattered with mud and clanking the ring
of his leash walked along just behind uncles horse with the serene
air of a conqueror

well i am like any other dog as long as its not a question of
coursing but when it is then look out his appearance seemed to
nicholas to be saying

when much later uncle rode up to nicholas and began talking to him
he felt flattered that after what had happened uncle deigned to
speak to him





chapter vii

toward evening ilagin took leave of nicholas who found that they were
so far from home that he accepted uncles offer that the hunting party
should spend the night in his little village of mikháylovna

and if you put up at my house that will be better still thats it
come on said uncle you see its damp weather and you could rest
and the little countess could be driven home in a trap

uncles offer was accepted a huntsman was sent to otradnoe for a
trap while nicholas rode with natásha and pétya to uncles house

some five male domestic serfs big and little rushed out to the front
porch to meet their master a score of women serfs old and young as
well as children popped out from the back entrance to have a look at
the hunters who were arriving the presence of natáshaa woman a lady
and on horsebackraised the curiosity of the serfs to such a degree that
many of them came up to her stared her in the face and unabashed by
her presence made remarks about her as though she were some prodigy on
show and not a human being able to hear or understand what was said
about her

arinka look she sits sideways there she sits and her skirt
dangles see shes got a little hunting horn

goodness gracious see her knife

isnt she a tartar

how is it you didnt go head over heels asked the boldest of all
addressing natásha directly

uncle dismounted at the porch of his little wooden house which stood
in the midst of an overgrown garden and after a glance at his
retainers shouted authoritatively that the superfluous ones should take
themselves off and that all necessary preparations should be made to
receive the guests and the visitors

the serfs all dispersed uncle lifted natásha off her horse and taking
her hand led her up the rickety wooden steps of the porch the house
with its bare unplastered log walls was not overcleanit did not seem
that those living in it aimed at keeping it spotlessbut neither was it
noticeably neglected in the entry there was a smell of fresh apples
and wolf and fox skins hung about

uncle led the visitors through the anteroom into a small hall with a
folding table and red chairs then into the drawing room with a round
birchwood table and a sofa and finally into his private room where
there was a tattered sofa a worn carpet and portraits of suvórov of
the hosts father and mother and of himself in military uniform the
study smelt strongly of tobacco and dogs uncle asked his visitors to
sit down and make themselves at home and then went out of the room
rugay his back still muddy came into the room and lay down on the
sofa cleaning himself with his tongue and teeth leading from the study
was a passage in which a partition with ragged curtains could be seen
from behind this came womens laughter and whispers natásha nicholas
and pétya took off their wraps and sat down on the sofa pétya leaning
on his elbow fell asleep at once natásha and nicholas were silent
their faces glowed they were hungry and very cheerful they looked at
one another now that the hunt was over and they were in the house
nicholas no longer considered it necessary to show his manly superiority
over his sister natásha gave him a wink and neither refrained long
from bursting into a peal of ringing laughter even before they had a
pretext ready to account for it

after a while uncle came in in a cossack coat blue trousers and
small top boots and natásha felt that this costume the very one she
had regarded with surprise and amusement at otradnoe was just the right
thing and not at all worse than a swallowtail or frock coat uncle
too was in high spirits and far from being offended by the brothers and
sisters laughter it could never enter his head that they might be
laughing at his way of life he himself joined in the merriment

thats right young countess thats it come on i never saw anyone
like her said he offering nicholas a pipe with a long stem and with
a practiced motion of three fingers taking down another that had been
cut short shes ridden all day like a man and is as fresh as ever

soon after uncles reappearance the door was opened evidently from
the sound by a barefooted girl and a stout rosy goodlooking woman of
about forty with a double chin and full red lips entered carrying a
large loaded tray with hospitable dignity and cordiality in her glance
and in every motion she looked at the visitors and with a pleasant
smile bowed respectfully in spite of her exceptional stoutness which
caused her to protrude her chest and stomach and throw back her head
this woman who was uncles housekeeper trod very lightly she went
to the table set down the tray and with her plump white hands deftly
took from it the bottles and various hors doeuvres and dishes and
arranged them on the table when she had finished she stepped aside and
stopped at the door with a smile on her face here i am i am she now
do you understand uncle her expression said to rostóv how could one
help understanding not only nicholas but even natásha understood the
meaning of his puckered brow and the happy complacent smile that
slightly puckered his lips when anisya fëdorovna entered on the tray
was a bottle of herb wine different kinds of vodka pickled mushrooms
rye cakes made with buttermilk honey in the comb still mead and
sparkling mead apples nuts raw and roasted and nutandhoney
sweets afterwards she brought a freshly roasted chicken ham preserves
made with honey and preserves made with sugar

all this was the fruit of anisya fëdorovnas housekeeping gathered and
prepared by her the smell and taste of it all had a smack of anisya
fëdorovna herself a savor of juiciness cleanliness whiteness and
pleasant smiles

take this little ladycountess she kept saying as she offered
natásha first one thing and then another

natásha ate of everything and thought she had never seen or eaten such
buttermilk cakes such aromatic jam such honeyandnut sweets or such
a chicken anywhere anisya fëdorovna left the room

after supper over their cherry brandy rostóv and uncle talked of
past and future hunts of rugay and ilagins dogs while natásha sat
upright on the sofa and listened with sparkling eyes she tried several
times to wake pétya that he might eat something but he only muttered
incoherent words without waking up natásha felt so lighthearted and
happy in these novel surroundings that she only feared the trap would
come for her too soon after a casual pause such as often occurs when
receiving friends for the first time in ones own house uncle
answering a thought that was in his visitors minds said

this you see is how i am finishing my days death will come thats
it come on nothing will remain then why harm anyone

uncles face was very significant and even handsome as he said this
involuntarily rostóv recalled all the good he had heard about him from
his father and the neighbors throughout the whole province uncle had
the reputation of being the most honorable and disinterested of cranks
they called him in to decide family disputes chose him as executor
confided secrets to him elected him to be a justice and to other posts
but he always persistently refused public appointments passing the
autumn and spring in the fields on his bay gelding sitting at home in
winter and lying in his overgrown garden in summer

why dont you enter the service uncle

i did once but gave it up i am not fit for it thats it come on i
cant make head or tail of it thats for youi havent brains enough
now hunting is another matterthats it come on open the door
there he shouted why have you shut it

the door at the end of the passage led to the huntsmens room as they
called the room for the hunt servants

there was a rapid patter of bare feet and an unseen hand opened the
door into the huntsmens room from which came the clear sounds of a
balalayka on which someone who was evidently a master of the art was
playing natásha had been listening to those strains for some time and
now went out into the passage to hear better

thats mitka my coachman i have got him a good balalayka im fond
of it said uncle

it was the custom for mitka to play the balalayka in the huntsmens room
when uncle returned from the chase uncle was fond of such music

how good really very good said nicholas with some unintentional
superciliousness as if ashamed to confess that the sounds pleased him
very much

very good said natásha reproachfully noticing her brothers tone
not very good its simply delicious

just as uncles pickled mushrooms honey and cherry brandy had seemed
to her the best in the world so also that song at that moment seemed
to her the acme of musical delight

more please more cried natásha at the door as soon as the balalayka
ceased mitka tuned up afresh and recommenced thrumming the balalayka
to the air of my lady with trills and variations uncle sat
listening slightly smiling with his head on one side the air was
repeated a hundred times the balalayka was retuned several times and
the same notes were thrummed again but the listeners did not grow weary
of it and wished to hear it again and again anisya fëdorovna came in
and leaned her portly person against the doorpost

you like listening she said to natásha with a smile extremely like
uncles thats a good player of ours she added

he doesnt play that part right said uncle suddenly with an
energetic gesture here he ought to burst outthats it come onought
to burst out

do you play then asked natásha

uncle did not answer but smiled

anisya go and see if the strings of my guitar are all right i havent
touched it for a long time thats itcome on ive given it up

anisya fëdorovna with her light step willingly went to fulfill her
errand and brought back the guitar

without looking at anyone uncle blew the dust off it and tapping the
case with his bony fingers tuned the guitar and settled himself in his
armchair he took the guitar a little above the fingerboard arching his
left elbow with a somewhat theatrical gesture and with a wink at
anisya fëdorovna struck a single chord pure and sonorous and then
quietly smoothly and confidently began playing in very slow time not
my lady but the wellknown song came a maiden down the street the
tune played with precision and in exact time began to thrill in the
hearts of nicholas and natásha arousing in them the same kind of sober
mirth as radiated from anisya fëdorovnas whole being anisya fëdorovna
flushed and drawing her kerchief over her face went laughing out of the
room uncle continued to play correctly carefully with energetic
firmness looking with a changed and inspired expression at the spot
where anisya fëdorovna had just stood something seemed to be laughing a
little on one side of his face under his gray mustaches especially as
the song grew brisker and the time quicker and when here and there as
he ran his fingers over the strings something seemed to snap

lovely lovely go on uncle go on shouted natásha as soon as he had
finished she jumped up and hugged and kissed him nicholas nicholas
she said turning to her brother as if asking him what is it moves me
so

nicholas too was greatly pleased by uncles playing and uncle
played the piece over again anisya fëdorovnas smiling face reappeared
in the doorway and behind hers other faces

fetching water clear and sweet stop dear maiden i entreat

played uncle once more running his fingers skillfully over the
strings and then he stopped short and jerked his shoulders

go on uncle dear natásha wailed in an imploring tone as if her life
depended on it

uncle rose and it was as if there were two men in him one of them
smiled seriously at the merry fellow while the merry fellow struck a
naïve and precise attitude preparatory to a folk dance

now then niece he exclaimed waving to natásha the hand that had
just struck a chord

natásha threw off the shawl from her shoulders ran forward to face
uncle and setting her arms akimbo also made a motion with her
shoulders and struck an attitude

where how and when had this young countess educated by an emigree
french governess imbibed from the russian air she breathed that spirit
and obtained that manner which the pas de chale  would one would have
supposed long ago have effaced but the spirit and the movements were
those inimitable and unteachable russian ones that uncle had expected
of her as soon as she had struck her pose and smiled triumphantly
proudly and with sly merriment the fear that had at first seized
nicholas and the others that she might not do the right thing was at an
end and they were already admiring her

 the french shawl dance

she did the right thing with such precision such complete precision
that anisya fëdorovna who had at once handed her the handkerchief she
needed for the dance had tears in her eyes though she laughed as she
watched this slim graceful countess reared in silks and velvets and so
different from herself who yet was able to understand all that was in
anisya and in anisyas father and mother and aunt and in every russian
man and woman

well little countess thats itcome on cried uncle with a joyous
laugh having finished the dance well done niece now a fine young
fellow must be found as husband for you thats itcome on

hes chosen already said nicholas smiling

oh said uncle in surprise looking inquiringly at natásha who
nodded her head with a happy smile

and such a one she said but as soon as she had said it a new train
of thoughts and feelings arose in her what did nicholas smile mean
when he said chosen already is he glad of it or not it is as if he
thought my bolkónski would not approve of or understand our gaiety but
he would understand it all where is he now she thought and her face
suddenly became serious but this lasted only a second dont dare to
think about it she said to herself and sat down again smilingly
beside uncle begging him to play something more

uncle played another song and a valse then after a pause he cleared
his throat and sang his favorite hunting song

as twas growing dark last night fell the snow so soft and light

uncle sang as peasants sing with full and naïve conviction that the
whole meaning of a song lies in the words and that the tune comes of
itself and that apart from the words there is no tune which exists
only to give measure to the words as a result of this the unconsidered
tune like the song of a bird was extraordinarily good natásha was in
ecstasies over uncles singing she resolved to give up learning the
harp and to play only the guitar she asked uncle for his guitar and
at once found the chords of the song

after nine oclock two traps and three mounted men who had been sent to
look for them arrived to fetch natásha and pétya the count and
countess did not know where they were and were very anxious said one of
the men

pétya was carried out like a log and laid in the larger of the two
traps natásha and nicholas got into the other uncle wrapped natásha
up warmly and took leave of her with quite a new tenderness he
accompanied them on foot as far as the bridge that could not be crossed
so that they had to go round by the ford and he sent huntsmen to ride
in front with lanterns

goodbye dear niece his voice called out of the darknessnot the
voice natásha had known previously but the one that had sung as twas
growing dark last night

in the village through which they passed there were red lights and a
cheerful smell of smoke

what a darling uncle is said natásha when they had come out onto the
highroad

yes returned nicholas youre not cold

no im quite quite all right i feel so comfortable answered
natásha almost perplexed by her feelings they remained silent a long
while the night was dark and damp they could not see the horses but
only heard them splashing through the unseen mud

what was passing in that receptive childlike soul that so eagerly caught
and assimilated all the diverse impressions of life how did they all
find place in her but she was very happy as they were nearing home she
suddenly struck up the air of as twas growing dark last nightthe tune
of which she had all the way been trying to get and had at last caught

got it said nicholas

what were you thinking about just now nicholas inquired natásha

they were fond of asking one another that question

i said nicholas trying to remember well you see first i thought
that rugay the red hound was like uncle and that if he were a man he
would always keep uncle near him if not for his riding then for his
manner what a good fellow uncle is dont you think so well and
you

i wait a bit wait yes first i thought that we are driving along
and imagining that we are going home but that heaven knows where we are
really going in the darkness and that we shall arrive and suddenly find
that we are not in otradnoe but in fairyland and then i thought no
nothing else

i know i expect you thought of him said nicholas smiling as natásha
knew by the sound of his voice

no said natásha though she had in reality been thinking about prince
andrew at the same time as of the rest and of how he would have liked
uncle and then i was saying to myself all the way how well anisya
carried herself how well and nicholas heard her spontaneous happy
ringing laughter and do you know she suddenly said i know that i
shall never again be as happy and tranquil as i am now

rubbish nonsense humbug exclaimed nicholas and he thought how
charming this natásha of mine is i have no other friend like her and
never shall have why should she marry we might always drive about
together

what a darling this nicholas of mine is thought natásha

ah there are still lights in the drawing room she said pointing to
the windows of the house that gleamed invitingly in the moist velvety
darkness of the night





chapter viii

count ilyá rostóv had resigned the position of marshal of the nobility
because it involved him in too much expense but still his affairs did
not improve natásha and nicholas often noticed their parents conferring
together anxiously and privately and heard suggestions of selling the
fine ancestral rostóv house and estate near moscow it was not necessary
to entertain so freely as when the count had been marshal and life at
otradnoe was quieter than in former years but still the enormous house
and its lodges were full of people and more than twenty sat down to
table every day these were all their own people who had settled down in
the house almost as members of the family or persons who were it
seemed obliged to live in the counts house such were dimmler the
musician and his wife vogel the dancing master and his family belova
an old maiden lady an inmate of the house and many others such as
pétyas tutors the girls former governess and other people who simply
found it preferable and more advantageous to live in the counts house
than at home they had not as many visitors as before but the old
habits of life without which the count and countess could not conceive
of existence remained unchanged there was still the hunting
establishment which nicholas had even enlarged the same fifty horses
and fifteen grooms in the stables the same expensive presents and
dinner parties to the whole district on name days there were still the
counts games of whist and boston at whichspreading out his cards so
that everybody could see themhe let himself be plundered of hundreds of
rubles every day by his neighbors who looked upon an opportunity to
play a rubber with count rostóv as a most profitable source of income

the count moved in his affairs as in a huge net trying not to believe
that he was entangled but becoming more and more so at every step and
feeling too feeble to break the meshes or to set to work carefully and
patiently to disentangle them the countess with her loving heart felt
that her children were being ruined that it was not the counts fault
for he could not help being what he wasthat though he tried to hide
it he himself suffered from the consciousness of his own and his
childrens ruin and she tried to find means of remedying the position
from her feminine point of view she could see only one solution namely
for nicholas to marry a rich heiress she felt this to be their last
hope and that if nicholas refused the match she had found for him she
would have to abandon the hope of ever getting matters right this match
was with julie karágina the daughter of excellent and virtuous parents
a girl the rostóvs had known from childhood and who had now become a
wealthy heiress through the death of the last of her brothers

the countess had written direct to julies mother in moscow suggesting a
marriage between their children and had received a favorable answer from
her karágina had replied that for her part she was agreeable and
everything depend on her daughters inclination she invited nicholas to
come to moscow

several times the countess with tears in her eyes told her son that
now both her daughters were settled her only wish was to see him
married she said she could lie down in her grave peacefully if that
were accomplished then she told him that she knew of a splendid girl
and tried to discover what he thought about marriage

at other times she praised julie to him and advised him to go to moscow
during the holidays to amuse himself nicholas guessed what his mothers
remarks were leading to and during one of these conversations induced
her to speak quite frankly she told him that her only hope of getting
their affairs disentangled now lay in his marrying julie karágina

but mamma suppose i loved a girl who has no fortune would you expect
me to sacrifice my feelings and my honor for the sake of money he
asked his mother not realizing the cruelty of his question and only
wishing to show his noblemindedness

no you have not understood me said his mother not knowing how to
justify herself you have not understood me nikolenka it is your
happiness i wish for she added feeling that she was telling an
untruth and was becoming entangled she began to cry

mamma dont cry only tell me that you wish it and you know i will
give my life anything to put you at ease said nicholas i would
sacrifice anything for youeven my feelings

but the countess did not want the question put like that she did not
want a sacrifice from her son she herself wished to make a sacrifice
for him

no you have not understood me dont let us talk about it she
replied wiping away her tears

maybe i do love a poor girl said nicholas to himself am i to
sacrifice my feelings and my honor for money i wonder how mamma could
speak so to me because sónya is poor i must not love her he thought
must not respond to her faithful devoted love yet i should certainly
be happier with her than with some dolllike julie i can always
sacrifice my feelings for my familys welfare he said to himself but
i cant coerce my feelings if i love sónya that feeling is for me
stronger and higher than all else

nicholas did not go to moscow and the countess did not renew the
conversation with him about marriage she saw with sorrow and sometimes
with exasperation symptoms of a growing attachment between her son and
the portionless sónya though she blamed herself for it she could not
refrain from grumbling at and worrying sónya often pulling her up
without reason addressing her stiffly as my dear and using the
formal you instead of the intimate thou in speaking to her the
kindhearted countess was the more vexed with sónya because that poor
darkeyed niece of hers was so meek so kind so devotedly grateful to
her benefactors and so faithfully unchangingly and unselfishly in
love with nicholas that there were no grounds for finding fault with
her

nicholas was spending the last of his leave at home a fourth letter had
come from prince andrew from rome in which he wrote that he would have
been on his way back to russia long ago had not his wound unexpectedly
reopened in the warm climate which obliged him to defer his return till
the beginning of the new year natásha was still as much in love with
her betrothed found the same comfort in that love and was still as
ready to throw herself into all the pleasures of life as before but at
the end of the fourth month of their separation she began to have fits
of depression which she could not master she felt sorry for herself
sorry that she was being wasted all this time and of no use to
anyonewhile she felt herself so capable of loving and being loved

things were not cheerful in the rostóvs home





chapter ix

christmas came and except for the ceremonial mass the solemn and
wearisome christmas congratulations from neighbors and servants and the
new dresses everyone put on there were no special festivities though
the calm frost of twenty degrees reaumur the dazzling sunshine by day
and the starlight of the winter nights seemed to call for some special
celebration of the season

on the third day of christmas week after the midday dinner all the
inmates of the house dispersed to various rooms it was the dullest time
of the day nicholas who had been visiting some neighbors that morning
was asleep on the sittingroom sofa the old count was resting in his
study sónya sat in the drawing room at the round table copying a
design for embroidery the countess was playing patience nastasya
ivánovna the buffoon sat with a sad face at the window with two old
ladies natásha came into the room went up to sónya glanced at what
she was doing and then went up to her mother and stood without
speaking

why are you wandering about like an outcast asked her mother what
do you want

him i want him now this minute i want him said natásha with
glittering eyes and no sign of a smile

the countess lifted her head and looked attentively at her daughter

dont look at me mamma dont look i shall cry directly

sit down with me a little said the countess

mamma i want him why should i be wasted like this mamma

her voice broke tears gushed from her eyes and she turned quickly to
hide them and left the room

she passed into the sitting room stood there thinking awhile and then
went into the maids room there an old maidservant was grumbling at a
young girl who stood panting having just run in through the cold from
the serfs quarters

stop playingtheres a time for everything said the old woman

let her alone kondratevna said natásha go mavrushka go

having released mavrushka natásha crossed the dancing hall and went to
the vestibule there an old footman and two young ones were playing
cards they broke off and rose as she entered

what can i do with them thought natásha

oh nikita please go where can i send him yes go to the yard
and fetch a fowl please a cock and you misha bring me some oats

just a few oats said misha cheerfully and readily

go go quickly the old man urged him

and you theodore get me a piece of chalk

on her way past the butlers pantry she told them to set a samovar
though it was not at all the time for tea

foka the butler was the most illtempered person in the house natásha
liked to test her power over him he distrusted the order and asked
whether the samovar was really wanted

oh dear what a young lady said foka pretending to frown at natásha

no one in the house sent people about or gave them as much trouble as
natásha did she could not see people unconcernedly but had to send
them on some errand she seemed to be trying whether any of them would
get angry or sulky with her but the serfs fulfilled no ones orders so
readily as they did hers what can i do where can i go thought she
as she went slowly along the passage

nastasya ivánovna what sort of children shall i have she asked the
buffoon who was coming toward her in a womans jacket

why fleas crickets grasshoppers answered the buffoon

o lord o lord its always the same oh where am i to go what am i
to do with myself and tapping with her heels she ran quickly upstairs
to see vogel and his wife who lived on the upper story

two governesses were sitting with the vogels at a table on which were
plates of raisins walnuts and almonds the governesses were discussing
whether it was cheaper to live in moscow or odessa natásha sat down
listened to their talk with a serious and thoughtful air and then got
up again

the island of madagascar she said madagascar she repeated
articulating each syllable distinctly and not replying to madame
schoss who asked her what she was saying she went out of the room

her brother pétya was upstairs too with the man in attendance on him he
was preparing fireworks to let off that night

pétya pétya she called to him carry me downstairs

pétya ran up and offered her his back she jumped on it putting her
arms round his neck and he pranced along with her

no dont the island of madagascar she said and jumping off his
back she went downstairs

having as it were reviewed her kingdom tested her power and made sure
that everyone was submissive but that all the same it was dull natásha
betook herself to the ballroom picked up her guitar sat down in a dark
corner behind a bookcase and began to run her fingers over the strings
in the bass picking out a passage she recalled from an opera she had
heard in petersburg with prince andrew what she drew from the guitar
would have had no meaning for other listeners but in her imagination a
whole series of reminiscences arose from those sounds she sat behind
the bookcase with her eyes fixed on a streak of light escaping from the
pantry door and listened to herself and pondered she was in a mood for
brooding on the past

sónya passed to the pantry with a glass in her hand natásha glanced at
her and at the crack in the pantry door and it seemed to her that she
remembered the light falling through that crack once before and sónya
passing with a glass in her hand yes it was exactly the same thought
natásha

sónya what is this she cried twanging a thick string

oh you are there said sónya with a start and came near and
listened i dont know a storm she ventured timidly afraid of being
wrong

there thats just how she started and just how she came up smiling
timidly when all this happened before thought natásha and in just
the same way i thought there was something lacking in her

no its the chorus from the watercarrier listen and natásha sang
the air of the chorus so that sónya should catch it where were you
going she asked

to change the water in this glass i am just finishing the design

you always find something to do but i cant said natásha and
wheres nicholas

asleep i think

sónya go and wake him said natásha tell him i want him to come and
sing

she sat awhile wondering what the meaning of it all having happened
before could be and without solving this problem or at all regretting
not having done so she again passed in fancy to the time when she was
with him and he was looking at her with a lovers eyes

oh if only he would come quicker i am so afraid it will never be
and worst of all i am growing oldthats the thing there wont then
be in me what there is now but perhaps hell come today will come
immediately perhaps he has come and is sitting in the drawing room
perhaps he came yesterday and i have forgotten it she rose put down
the guitar and went to the drawing room

all the domestic circle tutors governesses and guests were already
at the tea table the servants stood round the tablebut prince andrew
was not there and life was going on as before

ah here she is said the old count when he saw natásha enter well
sit down by me but natásha stayed by her mother and glanced round as
if looking for something

mamma she muttered give him to me give him mamma quickly
quickly and she again had difficulty in repressing her sobs

she sat down at the table and listened to the conversation between the
elders and nicholas who had also come to the table my god my god
the same faces the same talk papa holding his cup and blowing in the
same way thought natásha feeling with horror a sense of repulsion
rising up in her for the whole household because they were always the
same

after tea nicholas sónya and natásha went to the sitting room to
their favorite corner where their most intimate talks always began





chapter x

does it ever happen to you said natásha to her brother when they
settled down in the sitting room does it ever happen to you to feel as
if there were nothing more to comenothing that everything good is
past and to feel not exactly dull but sad

i should think so he replied i have felt like that when everything
was all right and everyone was cheerful the thought has come into my
mind that i was already tired of it all and that we must all die once
in the regiment i had not gone to some merrymaking where there was
music and suddenly i felt so depressed

oh yes i know i know i know natásha interrupted him when i was
quite little that used to be so with me do you remember when i was
punished once about some plums you were all dancing and i sat sobbing
in the schoolroom i shall never forget it i felt sad and sorry for
everyone for myself and for everyone and i was innocentthat was the
chief thing said natásha do you remember

i remember answered nicholas i remember that i came to you
afterwards and wanted to comfort you but do you know i felt ashamed
to we were terribly absurd i had a funny doll then and wanted to give
it to you do you remember

and do you remember natásha asked with a pensive smile how once
long long ago when we were quite little uncle called us into the
studythat was in the old houseand it was darkwe went in and suddenly
there stood

a negro chimed in nicholas with a smile of delight of course i
remember even now i dont know whether there really was a negro or if
we only dreamed it or were told about him

he was gray you remember and had white teeth and stood and looked at
us

sónya do you remember asked nicholas

yes yes i do remember something too sónya answered timidly

you know i have asked papa and mamma about that negro said natásha
and they say there was no negro at all but you see you remember

of course i do i remember his teeth as if i had just seen them

how strange it is its as if it were a dream i like that

and do you remember how we rolled hardboiled eggs in the ballroom and
suddenly two old women began spinning round on the carpet was that real
or not do you remember what fun it was

yes and you remember how papa in his blue overcoat fired a gun in the
porch

so they went through their memories smiling with pleasure not the sad
memories of old age but poetic youthful onesthose impressions of
ones most distant past in which dreams and realities blendand they
laughed with quiet enjoyment

sónya as always did not quite keep pace with them though they shared
the same reminiscences

much that they remembered had slipped from her mind and what she
recalled did not arouse the same poetic feeling as they experienced she
simply enjoyed their pleasure and tried to fit in with it

she only really took part when they recalled sónyas first arrival she
told them how afraid she had been of nicholas because he had on a corded
jacket and her nurse had told her that she too would be sewn up with
cords

and i remember their telling me that you had been born under a
cabbage said natásha and i remember that i dared not disbelieve it
then but knew that it was not true and i felt so uncomfortable

while they were talking a maid thrust her head in at the other door of
the sitting room

they have brought the cock miss she said in a whisper

it isnt wanted pétya tell them to take it away replied natásha

in the middle of their talk in the sitting room dimmler came in and
went up to the harp that stood there in a corner he took off its cloth
covering and the harp gave out a jarring sound

mr dimmler please play my favorite nocturne by field came the old
countess voice from the drawing room

dimmler struck a chord and turning to natásha nicholas and sónya
remarked how quiet you young people are

yes were philosophizing said natásha glancing round for a moment
and then continuing the conversation they were now discussing dreams

dimmler began to play natásha went on tiptoe noiselessly to the table
took up a candle carried it out and returned seating herself quietly
in her former place it was dark in the room especially where they were
sitting on the sofa but through the big windows the silvery light of
the full moon fell on the floor dimmler had finished the piece but
still sat softly running his fingers over the strings evidently
uncertain whether to stop or to play something else

do you know said natásha in a whisper moving closer to nicholas and
sónya that when one goes on and on recalling memories one at last
begins to remember what happened before one was in the world

that is metempsychosis said sónya who had always learned well and
remembered everything the egyptians believed that our souls have lived
in animals and will go back into animals again

no i dont believe we ever were in animals said natásha still in a
whisper though the music had ceased but i am certain that we were
angels somewhere there and have been here and that is why we
remember

may i join you said dimmler who had come up quietly and he sat down
by them

if we have been angels why have we fallen lower said nicholas no
that cant be

not lower who said we were lower how do i know what i was before
natásha rejoined with conviction the soul is immortalwell then if i
shall always live i must have lived before lived for a whole eternity

yes but it is hard for us to imagine eternity remarked dimmler who
had joined the young folk with a mildly condescending smile but now
spoke as quietly and seriously as they

why is it hard to imagine eternity said natásha it is now today
and it will be tomorrow and always and there was yesterday and the
day before

natásha now its your turn sing me something they heard the
countess say why are you sitting there like conspirators

mamma i dont at all want to replied natásha but all the same she
rose

none of them not even the middleaged dimmler wanted to break off
their conversation and quit that corner in the sitting room but natásha
got up and nicholas sat down at the clavichord standing as usual in the
middle of the hall and choosing the place where the resonance was best
natásha began to sing her mothers favorite song

she had said she did not want to sing but it was long since she had
sung and long before she again sang as she did that evening the
count from his study where he was talking to mitenka heard her and
like a schoolboy in a hurry to run out to play blundered in his talk
while giving orders to the steward and at last stopped while mitenka
stood in front of him also listening and smiling nicholas did not take
his eyes off his sister and drew breath in time with her sónya as she
listened thought of the immense difference there was between herself
and her friend and how impossible it was for her to be anything like as
bewitching as her cousin the old countess sat with a blissful yet sad
smile and with tears in her eyes occasionally shaking her head she
thought of natásha and of her own youth and of how there was something
unnatural and dreadful in this impending marriage of natásha and prince
andrew

dimmler who had seated himself beside the countess listened with
closed eyes

ah countess he said at last thats a european talent she has
nothing to learnwhat softness tenderness and strength

ah how afraid i am for her how afraid i am said the countess not
realizing to whom she was speaking her maternal instinct told her that
natásha had too much of something and that because of this she would
not be happy before natásha had finished singing fourteenyearold
pétya rushed in delightedly to say that some mummers had arrived

natásha stopped abruptly

idiot she screamed at her brother and running to a chair threw
herself on it sobbing so violently that she could not stop for a long
time

its nothing mamma really its nothing only pétya startled me she
said trying to smile but her tears still flowed and sobs still choked
her

the mummers some of the house serfs dressed up as bears turks
innkeepers and ladiesfrightening and funnybringing in with them the
cold from outside and a feeling of gaiety crowded at first timidly
into the anteroom then hiding behind one another they pushed into the
ballroom where shyly at first and then more and more merrily and
heartily they started singing dancing and playing christmas games
the countess when she had identified them and laughed at their
costumes went into the drawing room the count sat in the ballroom
smiling radiantly and applauding the players the young people had
disappeared

half an hour later there appeared among the other mummers in the
ballroom an old lady in a hooped skirtthis was nicholas a turkish girl
was pétya a clown was dimmler an hussar was natásha and a circassian
was sónya with burntcork mustache and eyebrows

after the condescending surprise nonrecognition and praise from those
who were not themselves dressed up the young people decided that their
costumes were so good that they ought to be shown elsewhere

nicholas who as the roads were in splendid condition wanted to take
them all for a drive in his troyka proposed to take with them about a
dozen of the serf mummers and drive to uncles

no why disturb the old fellow said the countess besides you
wouldnt have room to turn round there if you must go go to the
melyukovs

melyukova was a widow who with her family and their tutors and
governesses lived three miles from the rostóvs

thats right my dear chimed in the old count thoroughly aroused
ill dress up at once and go with them ill make pashette open her
eyes

but the countess would not agree to his going he had had a bad leg all
these last days it was decided that the count must not go but that if
louisa ivánovna madame schoss would go with them the young ladies
might go to the melyukovs sónya generally so timid and shy more
urgently than anyone begging louisa ivánovna not to refuse

sónyas costume was the best of all her mustache and eyebrows were
extraordinarily becoming everyone told her she looked very handsome
and she was in a spirited and energetic mood unusual with her some
inner voice told her that now or never her fate would be decided and in
her male attire she seemed quite a different person louisa ivánovna
consented to go and in half an hour four troyka sleighs with large and
small bells their runners squeaking and whistling over the frozen snow
drove up to the porch

natásha was foremost in setting a merry holiday tone which passing
from one to another grew stronger and reached its climax when they all
came out into the frost and got into the sleighs talking calling to
one another laughing and shouting

two of the troykas were the usual household sleighs the third was the
old counts with a trotter from the orlóv stud as shaft horse the
fourth was nicholas own with a short shaggy black shaft horse
nicholas in his old ladys dress over which he had belted his hussar
overcoat stood in the middle of the sleigh reins in hand

it was so light that he could see the moonlight reflected from the metal
harness disks and from the eyes of the horses who looked round in alarm
at the noisy party under the shadow of the porch roof

natásha sónya madame schoss and two maids got into nicholas sleigh
dimmler his wife and pétya into the old counts and the rest of the
mummers seated themselves in the other two sleighs

you go ahead zakhar shouted nicholas to his fathers coachman
wishing for a chance to race past him

the old counts troyka with dimmler and his party started forward
squeaking on its runners as though freezing to the snow its deeptoned
bell clanging the side horses pressing against the shafts of the
middle horse sank in the snow which was dry and glittered like sugar
and threw it up

nicholas set off following the first sleigh behind him the others
moved noisily their runners squeaking at first they drove at a steady
trot along the narrow road while they drove past the garden the shadows
of the bare trees often fell across the road and hid the brilliant
moonlight but as soon as they were past the fence the snowy plain
bathed in moonlight and motionless spread out before them glittering
like diamonds and dappled with bluish shadows bang bang went the
first sleigh over a cradle hole in the snow of the road and each of the
other sleighs jolted in the same way and rudely breaking the frost
bound stillness the troykas began to speed along the road one after
the other

a hares track a lot of tracks rang out natáshas voice through the
frostbound air

how light it is nicholas came sónyas voice

nicholas glanced round at sónya and bent down to see her face closer
quite a new sweet face with black eyebrows and mustaches peeped up at
him from her sable fursso close and yet so distantin the moonlight

that used to be sónya thought he and looked at her closer and
smiled

what is it nicholas

nothing said he and turned again to the horses

when they came out onto the beaten highroadpolished by sleigh runners
and cut up by roughshod hoofs the marks of which were visible in the
moonlightthe horses began to tug at the reins of their own accord and
increased their pace the near side horse arching his head and breaking
into a short canter tugged at his traces the shaft horse swayed from
side to side moving his ears as if asking isnt it time to begin
now in front already far ahead the deep bell of the sleigh ringing
farther and farther off the black horses driven by zakhar could be
clearly seen against the white snow from that sleigh one could hear the
shouts laughter and voices of the mummers

gee up my darlings shouted nicholas pulling the reins to one side
and flourishing the whip

it was only by the keener wind that met them and the jerks given by the
side horses who pulled harderever increasing their gallopthat one
noticed how fast the troyka was flying nicholas looked back with
screams squeals and waving of whips that caused even the shaft horses
to gallopthe other sleighs followed the shaft horse swung steadily
beneath the bow over its head with no thought of slackening pace and
ready to put on speed when required

nicholas overtook the first sleigh they were driving downhill and
coming out upon a broad trodden track across a meadow near a river

where are we thought he its the kosoy meadow i suppose but
nothis is something new ive never seen before this isnt the kosoy
meadow nor the demkin hill and heaven only knows what it is it is
something new and enchanted well whatever it may be and shouting
to his horses he began to pass the first sleigh

zakhar held back his horses and turned his face which was already
covered with hoarfrost to his eyebrows

nicholas gave the horses the rein and zakhar stretching out his arms
clucked his tongue and let his horses go

now look out master he cried

faster still the two troykas flew side by side and faster moved the
feet of the galloping side horses nicholas began to draw ahead zakhar
while still keeping his arms extended raised one hand with the reins

no you wont master he shouted

nicholas put all his horses to a gallop and passed zakhar the horses
showered the fine dry snow on the faces of those in the sleighbeside
them sounded quick ringing bells and they caught confused glimpses of
swiftly moving legs and the shadows of the troyka they were passing the
whistling sound of the runners on the snow and the voices of girls
shrieking were heard from different sides

again checking his horses nicholas looked around him they were still
surrounded by the magic plain bathed in moonlight and spangled with
stars

zakhar is shouting that i should turn to the left but why to the
left thought nicholas are we getting to the melyukovs is this
melyukovka heaven only knows where we are going and heaven knows what
is happening to usbut it is very strange and pleasant whatever it is
and he looked round in the sleigh

look his mustache and eyelashes are all white said one of the
strange pretty unfamiliar peoplethe one with fine eyebrows and
mustache

i think this used to be natásha thought nicholas and that was
madame schoss but perhaps its not and this circassian with the
mustache i dont know but i love her

arent you cold he asked

they did not answer but began to laugh dimmler from the sleigh behind
shouted somethingprobably something funnybut they could not make out
what he said

yes yes some voices answered laughing

but here was a fairy forest with black moving shadows and a glitter of
diamonds and a flight of marble steps and the silver roofs of fairy
buildings and the shrill yells of some animals and if this is really
melyukovka it is still stranger that we drove heaven knows where and
have come to melyukovka thought nicholas

it really was melyukovka and maids and footmen with merry faces came
running out to the porch carrying candles

who is it asked someone in the porch

the mummers from the counts i know by the horses replied some
voices





chapter xi

pelageya danilovna melyukova a broadly built energetic woman wearing
spectacles sat in the drawing room in a loose dress surrounded by her
daughters whom she was trying to keep from feeling dull they were
quietly dropping melted wax into snow and looking at the shadows the wax
figures would throw on the wall when they heard the steps and voices of
new arrivals in the vestibule

hussars ladies witches clowns and bears after clearing their
throats and wiping the hoarfrost from their faces in the vestibule came
into the ballroom where candles were hurriedly lighted the
clowndimmlerand the ladynicholasstarted a dance surrounded by the
screaming children the mummers covering their faces and disguising
their voices bowed to their hostess and arranged themselves about the
room

dear me theres no recognizing them and natásha see whom she looks
like she really reminds me of somebody but herr dimmlerisnt he good
i didnt know him and how he dances dear me theres a circassian
really how becoming it is to dear sónya and who is that well you
have cheered us up nikita and vanyaclear away the tables and we were
sitting so quietly ha ha ha the hussar the hussar just like a
boy and the legs i cant look at him different voices were
saying

natásha the young melyukovs favorite disappeared with them into the
back rooms where a cork and various dressing gowns and male garments
were called for and received from the footman by bare girlish arms from
behind the door ten minutes later all the young melyukovs joined the
mummers

pelageya danilovna having given orders to clear the rooms for the
visitors and arranged about refreshments for the gentry and the serfs
went about among the mummers without removing her spectacles peering
into their faces with a suppressed smile and failing to recognize any of
them it was not merely dimmler and the rostóvs she failed to recognize
she did not even recognize her own daughters or her late husbands
dressing gowns and uniforms which they had put on

and who is this she asked her governess peering into the face of her
own daughter dressed up as a kazantartar i suppose it is one of the
rostóvs well mr hussar and what regiment do you serve in she asked
natásha here hand some fruit jelly to the turk she ordered the
butler who was handing things round thats not forbidden by his law

sometimes as she looked at the strange but amusing capers cut by the
dancers whohaving decided once for all that being disguised no one
would recognize themwere not at all shy pelageya danilovna hid her
face in her handkerchief and her whole stout body shook with
irrepressible kindly elderly laughter

my little sasha look at sasha she said

after russian country dances and chorus dances pelageya danilovna made
the serfs and gentry join in one large circle a ring a string and a
silver ruble were fetched and they all played games together

in an hour all the costumes were crumpled and disordered the corked
eyebrows and mustaches were smeared over the perspiring flushed and
merry faces pelageya danilovna began to recognize the mummers admired
their cleverly contrived costumes and particularly how they suited the
young ladies and she thanked them all for having entertained her so
well the visitors were invited to supper in the drawing room and the
serfs had something served to them in the ballroom

now to tell ones fortune in the empty bathhouse is frightening said
an old maid who lived with the melyukovs during supper

why said the eldest melyukov girl

you wouldnt go it takes courage

ill go said sónya

tell what happened to the young lady said the second melyukov girl

well began the old maid a young lady once went out took a cock
laid the table for two all properly and sat down after sitting a
while she suddenly hears someone coming a sleigh drives up with
harness bells she hears him coming he comes in just in the shape of a
man like an officercomes in and sits down to table with her

ah ah screamed natásha rolling her eyes with horror

yes and how did he speak

yes like a man everything quite all right and he began persuading
her and she should have kept him talking till cockcrow but she got
frightened just got frightened and hid her face in her hands then he
caught her up it was lucky the maids ran in just then

now why frighten them said pelageya danilovna

mamma you used to try your fate yourself said her daughter

and how does one do it in a barn inquired sónya

well say you went to the barn now and listened it depends on what
you hear hammering and knockingthats bad but a sound of shifting
grain is good and one sometimes hears that too

mamma tell us what happened to you in the barn

pelageya danilovna smiled

oh ive forgotten she replied but none of you would go

yes i will pelageya danilovna let me ill go said sónya

well why not if youre not afraid

louisa ivánovna may i asked sónya

whether they were playing the ring and string game or the ruble game or
talking as now nicholas did not leave sónyas side and gazed at her
with quite new eyes it seemed to him that it was only today thanks to
that burntcork mustache that he had fully learned to know her and
really that evening sónya was brighter more animated and prettier
than nicholas had ever seen her before

so thats what she is like what a fool i have been he thought gazing
at her sparkling eyes and under the mustache a happy rapturous smile
dimpled her cheeks a smile he had never seen before

im not afraid of anything said sónya may i go at once she got
up

they told her where the barn was and how she should stand and listen
and they handed her a fur cloak she threw this over her head and
shoulders and glanced at nicholas

what a darling that girl is thought he and what have i been
thinking of till now

sónya went out into the passage to go to the barn nicholas went hastily
to the front porch saying he felt too hot the crowd of people really
had made the house stuffy

outside there was the same cold stillness and the same moon but even
brighter than before the light was so strong and the snow sparkled with
so many stars that one did not wish to look up at the sky and the real
stars were unnoticed the sky was black and dreary while the earth was
gay

i am a fool a fool what have i been waiting for thought nicholas
and running out from the porch he went round the corner of the house and
along the path that led to the back porch he knew sónya would pass that
way halfway lay some snowcovered piles of firewood and across and
along them a network of shadows from the bare old lime trees fell on the
snow and on the path this path led to the barn the log walls of the
barn and its snowcovered roof that looked as if hewn out of some
precious stone sparkled in the moonlight a tree in the garden snapped
with the frost and then all was again perfectly silent his bosom
seemed to inhale not air but the strength of eternal youth and gladness

from the back porch came the sound of feet descending the steps the
bottom step upon which snow had fallen gave a ringing creak and he heard
the voice of an old maidservant saying straight straight along the
path miss only dont look back

i am not afraid answered sónyas voice and along the path toward
nicholas came the crunching whistling sound of sónyas feet in her thin
shoes

sónya came along wrapped in her cloak she was only a couple of paces
away when she saw him and to her too he was not the nicholas she had
known and always slightly feared he was in a womans dress with
tousled hair and a happy smile new to sónya she ran rapidly toward him

quite different and yet the same thought nicholas looking at her
face all lit up by the moonlight he slipped his arms under the cloak
that covered her head embraced her pressed her to him and kissed her
on the lips that wore a mustache and had a smell of burnt cork sónya
kissed him full on the lips and disengaging her little hands pressed
them to his cheeks

sónya nicholas was all they said they ran to the barn and
then back again reentering he by the front and she by the back porch





chapter xii

when they all drove back from pelageya danilovnas natásha who always
saw and noticed everything arranged that she and madame schoss should
go back in the sleigh with dimmler and sónya with nicholas and the
maids

on the way back nicholas drove at a steady pace instead of racing and
kept peering by that fantastic alltransforming light into sónyas face
and searching beneath the eyebrows and mustache for his former and his
present sónya from whom he had resolved never to be parted again he
looked and recognizing in her both the old and the new sónya and being
reminded by the smell of burnt cork of the sensation of her kiss
inhaled the frosty air with a full breast and looking at the ground
flying beneath him and at the sparkling sky felt himself again in
fairyland

sónya is it well with thee he asked from time to time

yes she replied and with thee

when halfway home nicholas handed the reins to the coachman and ran for
a moment to natáshas sleigh and stood on its wing

natásha he whispered in french do you know i have made up my mind
about sónya

have you told her asked natásha suddenly beaming all over with joy

oh how strange you are with that mustache and those eyebrows
natáshaare you glad

i am so glad so glad i was beginning to be vexed with you i did not
tell you but you have been treating her badly what a heart she has
nicholas i am horrid sometimes but i was ashamed to be happy while
sónya was not continued natásha now i am so glad well run back to
her

no wait a bit oh how funny you look cried nicholas peering
into her face and finding in his sister too something new unusual and
bewitchingly tender that he had not seen in her before natásha its
magical isnt it

yes she replied you have done splendidly

had i seen her before as she is now thought nicholas i should long
ago have asked her what to do and have done whatever she told me and
all would have been well

so you are glad and i have done right

oh quite right i had a quarrel with mamma some time ago about it
mamma said she was angling for you how could she say such a thing i
nearly stormed at mamma i will never let anyone say anything bad of
sónya for there is nothing but good in her

then its all right said nicholas again scrutinizing the expression
of his sisters face to see if she was in earnest then he jumped down
and his boots scrunching the snow ran back to his sleigh the same
happy smiling circassian with mustache and beaming eyes looking up
from under a sable hood was still sitting there and that circassian
was sónya and that sónya was certainly his future happy and loving
wife

when they reached home and had told their mother how they had spent the
evening at the melyukovs the girls went to their bedroom when they
had undressed but without washing off the cork mustaches they sat a
long time talking of their happiness they talked of how they would live
when they were married how their husbands would be friends and how
happy they would be on natáshas table stood two looking glasses which
dunyasha had prepared beforehand

only when will all that be i am afraid never it would be too
good said natásha rising and going to the looking glasses

sit down natásha perhaps youll see him said sónya

natásha lit the candles one on each side of one of the looking glasses
and sat down

i see someone with a mustache said natásha seeing her own face

you mustnt laugh miss said dunyasha

with sónyas help and the maids natásha got the glass she held into
the right position opposite the other her face assumed a serious
expression and she sat silent she sat a long time looking at the
receding line of candles reflected in the glasses and expecting from
tales she had heard to see a coffin or him prince andrew in that
last dim indistinctly outlined square but ready as she was to take the
smallest speck for the image of a man or of a coffin she saw nothing
she began blinking rapidly and moved away from the looking glasses

why is it others see things and i dont she said you sit down now
sónya you absolutely must tonight do it for me today i feel so
frightened

sónya sat down before the glasses got the right position and began
looking

now miss sónya is sure to see something whispered dunyasha while
you do nothing but laugh

sónya heard this and natáshas whisper

i know she will she saw something last year

for about three minutes all were silent

of course she will whispered natásha but did not finish suddenly
sónya pushed away the glass she was holding and covered her eyes with
her hand

oh natásha she cried

did you see did you what was it exclaimed natásha holding up the
looking glass

sónya had not seen anything she was just wanting to blink and to get up
when she heard natásha say of course she will she did not wish to
disappoint either dunyasha or natásha but it was hard to sit still she
did not herself know how or why the exclamation escaped her when she
covered her eyes

you saw him urged natásha seizing her hand

yes wait a bit i saw him sónya could not help saying not yet
knowing whom natásha meant by him nicholas or prince andrew

but why shouldnt i say i saw something others do see besides who can
tell whether i saw anything or not flashed through sónyas mind

yes i saw him she said

how standing or lying

no i saw at first there was nothing then i saw him lying down

andrew lying is he ill asked natásha her frightened eyes fixed on
her friend

no on the contrary on the contrary his face was cheerful and he
turned to me and when saying this she herself fancied she had really
seen what she described

well and then sónya

after that i could not make out what there was something blue and
red

sónya when will he come back when shall i see him o god how afraid
i am for him and for myself and about everything natásha began and
without replying to sónyas words of comfort she got into bed and long
after her candle was out lay openeyed and motionless gazing at the
moonlight through the frosty windowpanes





chapter xiii

soon after the christmas holidays nicholas told his mother of his love
for sónya and of his firm resolve to marry her the countess who had
long noticed what was going on between them and was expecting this
declaration listened to him in silence and then told her son that he
might marry whom he pleased but that neither she nor his father would
give their blessing to such a marriage nicholas for the first time
felt that his mother was displeased with him and that despite her love
for him she would not give way coldly without looking at her son she
sent for her husband and when he came tried briefly and coldly to
inform him of the facts in her sons presence but unable to restrain
herself she burst into tears of vexation and left the room the old
count began irresolutely to admonish nicholas and beg him to abandon his
purpose nicholas replied that he could not go back on his word and his
father sighing and evidently disconcerted very soon became silent and
went in to the countess in all his encounters with his son the count
was always conscious of his own guilt toward him for having wasted the
family fortune and so he could not be angry with him for refusing to
marry an heiress and choosing the dowerless sónya on this occasion he
was only more vividly conscious of the fact that if his affairs had not
been in disorder no better wife for nicholas than sónya could have been
wished for and that no one but himself with his mitenka and his
uncomfortable habits was to blame for the condition of the family
finances

the father and mother did not speak of the matter to their son again
but a few days later the countess sent for sónya and with a cruelty
neither of them expected reproached her niece for trying to catch
nicholas and for ingratitude sónya listened silently with downcast eyes
to the countess cruel words without understanding what was required of
her she was ready to sacrifice everything for her benefactors self
sacrifice was her most cherished idea but in this case she could not see
what she ought to sacrifice or for whom she could not help loving the
countess and the whole rostóv family but neither could she help loving
nicholas and knowing that his happiness depended on that love she was
silent and sad and did not reply nicholas felt the situation to be
intolerable and went to have an explanation with his mother he first
implored her to forgive him and sónya and consent to their marriage
then he threatened that if she molested sónya he would at once marry her
secretly

the countess with a coldness her son had never seen in her before
replied that he was of age that prince andrew was marrying without his
fathers consent and he could do the same but that she would never
receive that intriguer as her daughter

exploding at the word intriguer nicholas raising his voice told his
mother he had never expected her to try to force him to sell his
feelings but if that were so he would say for the last time but he
had no time to utter the decisive word which the expression of his face
caused his mother to await with terror and which would perhaps have
forever remained a cruel memory to them both he had not time to say it
for natásha with a pale and set face entered the room from the door at
which she had been listening

nicholas you are talking nonsense be quiet be quiet be quiet i
tell you she almost screamed so as to drown his voice

mamma darling its not at all so my poor sweet darling she said
to her mother who conscious that they had been on the brink of a
rupture gazed at her son with terror but in the obstinacy and
excitement of the conflict could not and would not give way

nicholas ill explain to you go away listen mamma darling said
natásha

her words were incoherent but they attained the purpose at which she
was aiming

the countess sobbing heavily hid her face on her daughters breast
while nicholas rose clutching his head and left the room

natásha set to work to effect a reconciliation and so far succeeded
that nicholas received a promise from his mother that sónya should not
be troubled while he on his side promised not to undertake anything
without his parents knowledge

firmly resolved after putting his affairs in order in the regiment to
retire from the army and return and marry sónya nicholas serious
sorrowful and at variance with his parents but as it seemed to him
passionately in love left at the beginning of january to rejoin his
regiment

after nicholas had gone things in the rostóv household were more
depressing than ever and the countess fell ill from mental agitation

sónya was unhappy at the separation from nicholas and still more so on
account of the hostile tone the countess could not help adopting toward
her the count was more perturbed than ever by the condition of his
affairs which called for some decisive action their town house and
estate near moscow had inevitably to be sold and for this they had to
go to moscow but the countess health obliged them to delay their
departure from day to day

natásha who had borne the first period of separation from her betrothed
lightly and even cheerfully now grew more agitated and impatient every
day the thought that her best days which she would have employed in
loving him were being vainly wasted with no advantage to anyone
tormented her incessantly his letters for the most part irritated her
it hurt her to think that while she lived only in the thought of him he
was living a real life seeing new places and new people that interested
him the more interesting his letters were the more vexed she felt her
letters to him far from giving her any comfort seemed to her a
wearisome and artificial obligation she could not write because she
could not conceive the possibility of expressing sincerely in a letter
even a thousandth part of what she expressed by voice smile and
glance she wrote to him formal monotonous and dry letters to which
she attached no importance herself and in the rough copies of which the
countess corrected her mistakes in spelling

there was still no improvement in the countess health but it was
impossible to defer the journey to moscow any longer natáshas
trousseau had to be ordered and the house sold moreover prince andrew
was expected in moscow where old prince bolkónski was spending the
winter and natásha felt sure he had already arrived

so the countess remained in the country and the count taking sónya and
natásha with him went to moscow at the end of january





book eight





chapter i

after prince andrews engagement to natásha pierre without any apparent
cause suddenly felt it impossible to go on living as before firmly
convinced as he was of the truths revealed to him by his benefactor and
happy as he had been in perfecting his inner man to which he had
devoted himself with such ardorall the zest of such a life vanished
after the engagement of andrew and natásha and the death of joseph
alexeevich the news of which reached him almost at the same time only
the skeleton of life remained his house a brilliant wife who now
enjoyed the favors of a very important personage acquaintance with all
petersburg and his court service with its dull formalities and this
life suddenly seemed to pierre unexpectedly loathsome he ceased keeping
a diary avoided the company of the brothers began going to the club
again drank a great deal and came once more in touch with the bachelor
sets leading such a life that the countess hélène thought it necessary
to speak severely to him about it pierre felt that she was right and
to avoid compromising her went away to moscow

in moscow as soon as he entered his huge house in which the faded and
fading princesses still lived with its enormous retinue as soon as
driving through the town he saw the iberian shrine with innumerable
tapers burning before the golden covers of the icons the kremlin square
with its snow undisturbed by vehicles the sleigh drivers and hovels of
the sivtsev vrazhok those old moscovites who desired nothing hurried
nowhere and were ending their days leisurely when he saw those old
moscow ladies the moscow balls and the english club he felt himself
at home in a quiet haven in moscow he felt at peace at home warm and
dirty as in an old dressing gown

moscow society from the old women down to the children received pierre
like a longexpected guest whose place was always ready awaiting him
for moscow society pierre was the nicest kindest most intellectual
merriest and most magnanimous of cranks a heedless genial nobleman of
the old russian type his purse was always empty because it was open to
everyone

benefit performances poor pictures statues benevolent societies
gypsy choirs schools subscription dinners sprees freemasons
churches and booksno one and nothing met with a refusal from him and
had it not been for two friends who had borrowed large sums from him and
taken him under their protection he would have given everything away
there was never a dinner or soiree at the club without him as soon as
he sank into his place on the sofa after two bottles of margaux he was
surrounded and talking disputing and joking began when there were
quarrels his kindly smile and welltimed jests reconciled the
antagonists the masonic dinners were dull and dreary when he was not
there

when after a bachelor supper he rose with his amiable and kindly smile
yielding to the entreaties of the festive company to drive off somewhere
with them shouts of delight and triumph arose among the young men at
balls he danced if a partner was needed young ladies married and
unmarried liked him because without making love to any of them he was
equally amiable to all especially after supper il est charmant il
na pas de sexe  they said of him

 he is charming he has no sex

pierre was one of those retired gentlemeninwaiting of whom there were
hundreds goodhumoredly ending their days in moscow

how horrified he would have been seven years before when he first
arrived from abroad had he been told that there was no need for him to
seek or plan anything that his rut had long been shaped eternally
predetermined and that wriggle as he might he would be what all in his
position were he could not have believed it had he not at one time
longed with all his heart to establish a republic in russia then
himself to be a napoleon then to be a philosopher and then a
strategist and the conqueror of napoleon had he not seen the
possibility of and passionately desired the regeneration of the sinful
human race and his own progress to the highest degree of perfection
had he not established schools and hospitals and liberated his serfs

but instead of all thathere he was the wealthy husband of an
unfaithful wife a retired gentlemaninwaiting fond of eating and
drinking and as he unbuttoned his waistcoat of abusing the government
a bit a member of the moscow english club and a universal favorite in
moscow society for a long time he could not reconcile himself to the
idea that he was one of those same retired moscow gentlemeninwaiting
he had so despised seven years before

sometimes he consoled himself with the thought that he was only living
this life temporarily but then he was shocked by the thought of how
many like himself had entered that life and that club temporarily
with all their teeth and hair and had only left it when not a single
tooth or hair remained

in moments of pride when he thought of his position it seemed to him
that he was quite different and distinct from those other retired
gentlemeninwaiting he had formerly despised they were empty stupid
contented fellows satisfied with their position while i am still
discontented and want to do something for mankind but perhaps all these
comrades of mine struggled just like me and sought something new a path
in life of their own and like me were brought by force of
circumstances society and raceby that elemental force against which
man is powerlessto the condition i am in said he to himself in
moments of humility and after living some time in moscow he no longer
despised but began to grow fond of to respect and to pity his
comrades in destiny as he pitied himself

pierre no longer suffered moments of despair hypochondria and disgust
with life but the malady that had formerly found expression in such
acute attacks was driven inwards and never left him for a moment what
for why what is going on in the world he would ask himself in
perplexity several times a day involuntarily beginning to reflect anew
on the meaning of the phenomena of life but knowing by experience that
there were no answers to these questions he made haste to turn away from
them and took up a book or hurried off to the club or to apollon
nikoláevichs to exchange the gossip of the town

hélène who has never cared for anything but her own body and is one of
the stupidest women in the world thought pierre is regarded by
people as the acme of intelligence and refinement and they pay homage
to her napoleon bonaparte was despised by all as long as he was great
but now that he has become a wretched comedian the emperor francis wants
to offer him his daughter in an illegal marriage the spaniards through
the catholic clergy offer praise to god for their victory over the
french on the fourteenth of june and the french also through the
catholic clergy offer praise because on that same fourteenth of june
they defeated the spaniards my brother masons swear by the blood that
they are ready to sacrifice everything for their neighbor but they do
not give a ruble each to the collections for the poor and they
intrigue the astraea lodge against the manna seekers and fuss about an
authentic scotch carpet and a charter that nobody needs and the meaning
of which the very man who wrote it does not understand we all profess
the christian law of forgiveness of injuries and love of our neighbors
the law in honor of which we have built in moscow forty times forty
churchesbut yesterday a deserter was knouted to death and a minister of
that same law of love and forgiveness a priest gave the soldier a
cross to kiss before his execution so thought pierre and the whole of
this general deception which everyone accepts accustomed as he was to
it astonished him each time as if it were something new i understand
the deception and confusion he thought but how am i to tell them all
that i see i have tried and have always found that they too in the
depths of their souls understand it as i do and only try not to see it
so it appears that it must be so but iwhat is to become of me
thought he he had the unfortunate capacity many men especially
russians have of seeing and believing in the possibility of goodness
and truth but of seeing the evil and falsehood of life too clearly to
be able to take a serious part in it every sphere of work was
connected in his eyes with evil and deception whatever he tried to
be whatever he engaged in the evil and falsehood of it repulsed him
and blocked every path of activity yet he had to live and to find
occupation it was too dreadful to be under the burden of these
insoluble problems so he abandoned himself to any distraction in order
to forget them he frequented every kind of society drank much bought
pictures engaged in building and above allread

he read and read everything that came to hand on coming home while
his valets were still taking off his things he picked up a book and
began to read from reading he passed to sleeping from sleeping to
gossip in drawing rooms of the club from gossip to carousals and women
from carousals back to gossip reading and wine drinking became more
and more a physical and also a moral necessity though the doctors
warned him that with his corpulence wine was dangerous for him he drank
a great deal he was only quite at ease when having poured several
glasses of wine mechanically into his large mouth he felt a pleasant
warmth in his body an amiability toward all his fellows and a
readiness to respond superficially to every idea without probing it
deeply only after emptying a bottle or two did he feel dimly that the
terribly tangled skein of life which previously had terrified him was
not as dreadful as he had thought he was always conscious of some
aspect of that skein as with a buzzing in his head after dinner or
supper he chatted or listened to conversation or read but under the
influence of wine he said to himself it doesnt matter ill get it
unraveled i have a solution ready but have no time nowill think it
all out later on but the later on never came

in the morning on an empty stomach all the old questions appeared as
insoluble and terrible as ever and pierre hastily picked up a book and
if anyone came to see him he was glad

sometimes he remembered how he had heard that soldiers in war when
entrenched under the enemys fire if they have nothing to do try hard
to find some occupation the more easily to bear the danger to pierre
all men seemed like those soldiers seeking refuge from life some in
ambition some in cards some in framing laws some in women some in
toys some in horses some in politics some in sport some in wine and
some in governmental affairs nothing is trivial and nothing is
important its all the sameonly to save oneself from it as best one
can thought pierre only not to see it that dreadful it





chapter ii

at the beginning of winter prince nicholas bolkónski and his daughter
moved to moscow at that time enthusiasm for the emperor alexanders
regime had weakened and a patriotic and antifrench tendency prevailed
there and this together with his past and his intellect and his
originality at once made prince nicholas bolkónski an object of
particular respect to the moscovites and the center of the moscow
opposition to the government

the prince had aged very much that year he showed marked signs of
senility by a tendency to fall asleep forgetfulness of quite recent
events remembrance of remote ones and the childish vanity with which
he accepted the role of head of the moscow opposition in spite of this
the old man inspired in all his visitors alike a feeling of respectful
venerationespecially of an evening when he came in to tea in his old
fashioned coat and powdered wig and aroused by anyone told his abrupt
stories of the past or uttered yet more abrupt and scathing criticisms
of the present for them all that oldfashioned house with its gigantic
mirrors prerevolution furniture powdered footmen and the stern
shrewd old man himself a relic of the past century with his gentle
daughter and the pretty frenchwoman who were reverently devoted to him
presented a majestic and agreeable spectacle but the visitors did not
reflect that besides the couple of hours during which they saw their
host there were also twentytwo hours in the day during which the
private and intimate life of the house continued

latterly that private life had become very trying for princess mary
there in moscow she was deprived of her greatest pleasurestalks with
the pilgrims and the solitude which refreshed her at bald hillsand she
had none of the advantages and pleasures of city life she did not go
out into society everyone knew that her father would not let her go
anywhere without him and his failing health prevented his going out
himself so that she was not invited to dinners and evening parties she
had quite abandoned the hope of getting married she saw the coldness
and malevolence with which the old prince received and dismissed the
young men possible suitors who sometimes appeared at their house she
had no friends during this visit to moscow she had been disappointed in
the two who had been nearest to her mademoiselle bourienne with whom
she had never been able to be quite frank had now become unpleasant to
her and for various reasons princess mary avoided her julie with whom
she had corresponded for the last five years was in moscow but proved
to be quite alien to her when they met just then julie who by the
death of her brothers had become one of the richest heiresses in moscow
was in the full whirl of society pleasures she was surrounded by young
men who she fancied had suddenly learned to appreciate her worth
julie was at that stage in the life of a society woman when she feels
that her last chance of marrying has come and that her fate must be
decided now or never on thursdays princess mary remembered with a
mournful smile that she now had no one to write to since juliewhose
presence gave her no pleasure was here and they met every week like the
old emigre who declined to marry the lady with whom he had spent his
evenings for years she regretted julies presence and having no one to
write to in moscow princess mary had no one to talk to no one to whom
to confide her sorrow and much sorrow fell to her lot just then the
time for prince andrews return and marriage was approaching but his
request to her to prepare his father for it had not been carried out in
fact it seemed as if matters were quite hopeless for at every mention
of the young countess rostóva the old prince who apart from that was
usually in a bad temper lost control of himself another lately added
sorrow arose from the lessons she gave her six yearold nephew to her
consternation she detected in herself in relation to little nicholas
some symptoms of her fathers irritability however often she told
herself that she must not get irritable when teaching her nephew almost
every time that pointer in hand she sat down to show him the french
alphabet she so longed to pour her own knowledge quickly and easily
into the childwho was already afraid that auntie might at any moment
get angrythat at his slightest inattention she trembled became
flustered and heated raised her voice and sometimes pulled him by the
arm and put him in the corner having put him in the corner she would
herself begin to cry over her cruel evil nature and little nicholas
following her example would sob and without permission would leave his
corner come to her pull her wet hands from her face and comfort her
but what distressed the princess most of all was her fathers
irritability which was always directed against her and had of late
amounted to cruelty had he forced her to prostrate herself to the
ground all night had he beaten her or made her fetch wood or water it
would never have entered her mind to think her position hard but this
loving despotthe more cruel because he loved her and for that reason
tormented himself and herknew how not merely to hurt and humiliate her
deliberately but to show her that she was always to blame for
everything of late he had exhibited a new trait that tormented princess
mary more than anything else this was his everincreasing intimacy with
mademoiselle bourienne the idea that at the first moment of receiving
the news of his sons intentions had occurred to him in jestthat if
andrew got married he himself would marry bouriennehad evidently
pleased him and latterly he had persistently and as it seemed to
princess mary merely to offend her shown special endearments to the
companion and expressed his dissatisfaction with his daughter by
demonstrations of love of bourienne

one day in moscow in princess marys presence she thought her father
did it purposely when she was there the old prince kissed mademoiselle
bouriennes hand and drawing her to him embraced her affectionately
princess mary flushed and ran out of the room a few minutes later
mademoiselle bourienne came into princess marys room smiling and making
cheerful remarks in her agreeable voice princess mary hastily wiped
away her tears went resolutely up to mademoiselle bourienne and
evidently unconscious of what she was doing began shouting in angry
haste at the frenchwoman her voice breaking its horrible vile
inhuman to take advantage of the weakness she did not finish
leave my room she exclaimed and burst into sobs

next day the prince did not say a word to his daughter but she noticed
that at dinner he gave orders that mademoiselle bourienne should be
served first after dinner when the footman handed coffee and from
habit began with the princess the prince suddenly grew furious threw
his stick at philip and instantly gave instructions to have him
conscripted for the army

he doesnt obey i said it twice and he doesnt obey she is the
first person in this house shes my best friend cried the prince
and if you allow yourself he screamed in a fury addressing princess
mary for the first time to forget yourself again before her as you
dared to do yesterday i will show you who is master in this house go
dont let me set eyes on you beg her pardon

princess mary asked mademoiselle bouriennes pardon and also her
fathers pardon for herself and for philip the footman who had begged
for her intervention

at such moments something like a pride of sacrifice gathered in her
soul and suddenly that father whom she had judged would look for his
spectacles in her presence fumbling near them and not seeing them or
would forget something that had just occurred or take a false step with
his failing legs and turn to see if anyone had noticed his feebleness
or worst of all at dinner when there were no visitors to excite him
would suddenly fall asleep letting his napkin drop and his shaking head
sink over his plate he is old and feeble and i dare to condemn him
she thought at such moments with a feeling of revulsion against
herself





chapter iii

in  there was living in moscow a french doctormetivierwho had
rapidly become the fashion he was enormously tall handsome amiable as
frenchmen are and was as all moscow said an extraordinarily clever
doctor he was received in the best houses not merely as a doctor but
as an equal

prince nicholas had always ridiculed medicine but latterly on
mademoiselle bouriennes advice had allowed this doctor to visit him and
had grown accustomed to him metivier came to see the prince about twice
a week

on december st nicholas day and the princes name dayall moscow
came to the princes front door but he gave orders to admit no one and
to invite to dinner only a small number a list of whom he gave to
princess mary

metivier who came in the morning with his felicitations considered it
proper in his quality of doctor de forcer la consigne  as he told
princess mary and went in to see the prince it happened that on that
morning of his name day the prince was in one of his worst moods he had
been going about the house all the morning finding fault with everyone
and pretending not to understand what was said to him and not to be
understood himself princess mary well knew this mood of quiet absorbed
querulousness which generally culminated in a burst of rage and she
went about all that morning as though facing a cocked and loaded gun and
awaited the inevitable explosion until the doctors arrival the morning
had passed off safely after admitting the doctor princess mary sat
down with a book in the drawing room near the door through which she
could hear all that passed in the study

 to force the guard

at first she heard only metiviers voice then her fathers then both
voices began speaking at the same time the door was flung open and on
the threshold appeared the handsome figure of the terrified metivier
with his shock of black hair and the prince in his dressing gown and
fez his face distorted with fury and the pupils of his eyes rolled
downwards

you dont understand shouted the prince but i do french spy slave
of buonaparte spy get out of my house be off i tell you

metivier shrugging his shoulders went up to mademoiselle bourienne who
at the sound of shouting had run in from an adjoining room

the prince is not very well bile and rush of blood to the head keep
calm i will call again tomorrow said metivier and putting his
fingers to his lips he hastened away

through the study door came the sound of slippered feet and the cry
spies traitors traitors everywhere not a moments peace in my own
house

after metiviers departure the old prince called his daughter in and
the whole weight of his wrath fell on her she was to blame that a spy
had been admitted had he not told her yes told her to make a list
and not to admit anyone who was not on that list then why was that
scoundrel admitted she was the cause of it all with her he said he
could not have a moments peace and could not die quietly

no maam we must part we must part understand that understand it
i cannot endure any more he said and left the room then as if
afraid she might find some means of consolation he returned and trying
to appear calm added and dont imagine i have said this in a moment of
anger i am calm i have thought it over and it will be carried outwe
must part so find some place for yourself but he could not
restrain himself and with the virulence of which only one who loves is
capable evidently suffering himself he shook his fists at her and
screamed

if only some fool would marry her then he slammed the door sent for
mademoiselle bourienne and subsided into his study

at two oclock the six chosen guests assembled for dinner

these gueststhe famous count rostopchin prince lopukhin with his
nephew general chatrov an old war comrade of the princes and of the
younger generation pierre and borís drubetskóyawaited the prince in the
drawing room

borís who had come to moscow on leave a few days before had been
anxious to be presented to prince nicholas bolkónski and had contrived
to ingratiate himself so well that the old prince in his case made an
exception to the rule of not receiving bachelors in his house

the princes house did not belong to what is known as fashionable
society but his little circlethough not much talked about in townwas
one it was more flattering to be received in than any other borís had
realized this the week before when the commanderinchief in his
presence invited rostopchin to dinner on st nicholas day and
rostopchin had replied that he could not come

on that day i always go to pay my devotions to the relics of prince
nicholas bolkónski

oh yes yes replied the commanderinchief how is he

the small group that assembled before dinner in the lofty oldfashioned
drawing room with its old furniture resembled the solemn gathering of a
court of justice all were silent or talked in low tones prince
nicholas came in serious and taciturn princess mary seemed even quieter
and more diffident than usual the guests were reluctant to address her
feeling that she was in no mood for their conversation count rostopchin
alone kept the conversation going now relating the latest town news
and now the latest political gossip

lopukhin and the old general occasionally took part in the conversation
prince bolkónski listened as a presiding judge receives a report only
now and then silently or by a brief word showing that he took heed of
what was being reported to him the tone of the conversation was such as
indicated that no one approved of what was being done in the political
world incidents were related evidently confirming the opinion that
everything was going from bad to worse but whether telling a story or
giving an opinion the speaker always stopped or was stopped at the
point beyond which his criticism might touch the sovereign himself

at dinner the talk turned on the latest political news napoleons
seizure of the duke of oldenburgs territory and the russian note
hostile to napoleon which had been sent to all the european courts

bonaparte treats europe as a pirate does a captured vessel said count
rostopchin repeating a phrase he had uttered several times before one
only wonders at the longsuffering or blindness of the crowned heads
now the popes turn has come and bonaparte doesnt scruple to depose the
head of the catholic churchyet all keep silent our sovereign alone has
protested against the seizure of the duke of oldenburgs territory and
even count rostopchin paused feeling that he had reached the limit
beyond which censure was impossible

other territories have been offered in exchange for the duchy of
oldenburg said prince bolkónski he shifts the dukes about as i might
move my serfs from bald hills to bogucharovo or my ryazan estates

the duke of oldenburg bears his misfortunes with admirable strength of
character and resignation remarked borís joining in respectfully

he said this because on his journey from petersburg he had had the honor
of being presented to the duke prince bolkónski glanced at the young
man as if about to say something in reply but changed his mind
evidently considering him too young

i have read our protests about the oldenburg affair and was surprised
how badly the note was worded remarked count rostopchin in the casual
tone of a man dealing with a subject quite familiar to him

pierre looked at rostopchin with naïve astonishment not understanding
why he should be disturbed by the bad composition of the note

does it matter count how the note is worded he asked so long as
its substance is forcible

my dear fellow with our five hundred thousand troops it should be easy
to have a good style returned count rostopchin

pierre now understood the counts dissatisfaction with the wording of
the note

one would have thought quill drivers enough had sprung up remarked
the old prince there in petersburg they are always writingnot notes
only but even new laws my andrew there has written a whole volume of
laws for russia nowadays they are always writing and he laughed
unnaturally

there was a momentary pause in the conversation the old general cleared
his throat to draw attention

did you hear of the last event at the review in petersburg the figure
cut by the new french ambassador

eh yes i heard something he said something awkward in his majestys
presence

his majesty drew attention to the grenadier division and to the march
past continued the general and it seems the ambassador took no
notice and allowed himself to reply that we in france pay no attention
to such trifles the emperor did not condescend to reply at the next
review they say the emperor did not once deign to address him

all were silent on this fact relating to the emperor personally it was
impossible to pass any judgment

impudent fellows said the prince you know metivier i turned him
out of my house this morning he was here they admitted him in spite of
my request that they should let no one in he went on glancing angrily
at his daughter

and he narrated his whole conversation with the french doctor and the
reasons that convinced him that metivier was a spy though these reasons
were very insufficient and obscure no one made any rejoinder

after the roast champagne was served the guests rose to congratulate
the old prince princess mary too went round to him

he gave her a cold angry look and offered her his wrinkled clean
shaven cheek to kiss the whole expression of his face told her that he
had not forgotten the mornings talk that his decision remained in
force and only the presence of visitors hindered his speaking of it to
her now

when they went into the drawing room where coffee was served the old
men sat together

prince nicholas grew more animated and expressed his views on the
impending war

he said that our wars with bonaparte would be disastrous so long as we
sought alliances with the germans and thrust ourselves into european
affairs into which we had been drawn by the peace of tilsit we ought
not to fight either for or against austria our political interests are
all in the east and in regard to bonaparte the only thing is to have an
armed frontier and a firm policy and he will never dare to cross the
russian frontier as was the case in

how can we fight the french prince said count rostopchin can we
arm ourselves against our teachers and divinities look at our youths
look at our ladies the french are our gods paris is our kingdom of
heaven

he began speaking louder evidently to be heard by everyone

french dresses french ideas french feelings there now you turned
metivier out by the scruff of his neck because he is a frenchman and a
scoundrel but our ladies crawl after him on their knees i went to a
party last night and there out of five ladies three were roman
catholics and had the popes indulgence for doing woolwork on sundays
and they themselves sit there nearly naked like the signboards at our
public baths if i may say so ah when one looks at our young people
prince one would like to take peter the greats old cudgel out of the
museum and belabor them in the russian way till all the nonsense jumps
out of them

all were silent the old prince looked at rostopchin with a smile and
wagged his head approvingly

well goodby your excellency keep well said rostopchin getting up
with characteristic briskness and holding out his hand to the prince

goodbye my dear fellow his words are music i never tire of
hearing him said the old prince keeping hold of the hand and offering
his cheek to be kissed

following rostopchins example the others also rose





chapter iv

princess mary as she sat listening to the old mens talk and
faultfinding understood nothing of what she heard she only wondered
whether the guests had all observed her fathers hostile attitude toward
her she did not even notice the special attentions and amiabilities
shown her during dinner by borís drubetskóy who was visiting them for
the third time already

princess mary turned with absentminded questioning look to pierre who
hat in hand and with a smile on his face was the last of the guests to
approach her after the old prince had gone out and they were left alone
in the drawing room

may i stay a little longer he said letting his stout body sink into
an armchair beside her

oh yes she answered you noticed nothing her look asked

pierre was in an agreeable afterdinner mood he looked straight before
him and smiled quietly

have you known that young man long princess he asked

who

drubetskóy

no not long

do you like him

yes he is an agreeable young man why do you ask me that said
princess mary still thinking of that mornings conversation with her
father

because i have noticed that when a young man comes on leave from
petersburg to moscow it is usually with the object of marrying an
heiress

you have observed that said princess mary

yes returned pierre with a smile and this young man now manages
matters so that where there is a wealthy heiress there he is too i can
read him like a book at present he is hesitating whom to lay siege
toyou or mademoiselle julie karágina he is very attentive to her

he visits them

yes very often and do you know the new way of courting said pierre
with an amused smile evidently in that cheerful mood of good humored
raillery for which he so often reproached himself in his diary

no replied princess mary

to please moscow girls nowadays one has to be melancholy he is very
melancholy with mademoiselle karágina said pierre

really asked princess mary looking into pierres kindly face and
still thinking of her own sorrow it would be a relief thought she
if i ventured to confide what i am feeling to someone i should like to
tell everything to pierre he is kind and generous it would be a
relief he would give me advice

would you marry him

oh my god count there are moments when i would marry anybody she
cried suddenly to her own surprise and with tears in her voice ah how
bitter it is to love someone near to you and to feel that she went
on in a trembling voice that you can do nothing for him but grieve
him and to know that you cannot alter this then there is only one
thing leftto go away but where could i go

what is wrong what is it princess

but without finishing what she was saying princess mary burst into
tears

i dont know what is the matter with me today dont take any
noticeforget what i have said

pierres gaiety vanished completely he anxiously questioned the
princess asked her to speak out fully and confide her grief to him but
she only repeated that she begged him to forget what she had said that
she did not remember what she had said and that she had no trouble
except the one he knew ofthat prince andrews marriage threatened to
cause a rupture between father and son

have you any news of the rostóvs she asked to change the subject i
was told they are coming soon i am also expecting andrew any day i
should like them to meet here

and how does he now regard the matter asked pierre referring to the
old prince

princess mary shook her head

what is to be done in a few months the year will be up the thing is
impossible i only wish i could spare my brother the first moments i
wish they would come sooner i hope to be friends with her you have
known them a long time said princess mary tell me honestly the whole
truth what sort of girl is she and what do you think of herthe real
truth because you know andrew is risking so much doing this against his
fathers will that i should like to know

an undefined instinct told pierre that these explanations and repeated
requests to be told the whole truth expressed illwill on the princess
part toward her future sisterinlaw and a wish that he should
disapprove of andrews choice but in reply he said what he felt rather
than what he thought

i dont know how to answer your question he said blushing without
knowing why i really dont know what sort of girl she is i cant
analyze her at all she is enchanting but what makes her so i dont
know that is all one can say about her

princess mary sighed and the expression on her face said yes thats
what i expected and feared

is she clever she asked

pierre considered

i think not he said and yetyes she does not deign to be
clever oh no she is simply enchanting and that is all

princess mary again shook her head disapprovingly

ah i so long to like her tell her so if you see her before i do

i hear they are expected very soon said pierre

princess mary told pierre of her plan to become intimate with her future
sisterinlaw as soon as the rostóvs arrived and to try to accustom the
old prince to her





chapter v

borís had not succeeded in making a wealthy match in petersburg so with
the same object in view he came to moscow there he wavered between the
two richest heiresses julie and princess mary though princess mary
despite her plainness seemed to him more attractive than julie he
without knowing why felt awkward about paying court to her when they
had last met on the old princes name day she had answered at random
all his attempts to talk sentimentally evidently not listening to what
he was saying

julie on the contrary accepted his attentions readily though in a
manner peculiar to herself

she was twentyseven after the death of her brothers she had become
very wealthy she was by now decidedly plain but thought herself not
merely as goodlooking as before but even far more attractive she was
confirmed in this delusion by the fact that she had become a very
wealthy heiress and also by the fact that the older she grew the less
dangerous she became to men and the more freely they could associate
with her and avail themselves of her suppers soirees and the animated
company that assembled at her house without incurring any obligation a
man who would have been afraid ten years before of going every day to
the house when there was a girl of seventeen there for fear of
compromising her and committing himself would now go boldly every day
and treat her not as a marriageable girl but as a sexless acquaintance

that winter the karagins house was the most agreeable and hospitable in
moscow in addition to the formal evening and dinner parties a large
company chiefly of men gathered there every day supping at midnight
and staying till three in the morning julie never missed a ball a
promenade or a play her dresses were always of the latest fashion but
in spite of that she seemed to be disillusioned about everything and
told everyone that she did not believe either in friendship or in love
or any of the joys of life and expected peace only yonder she
adopted the tone of one who has suffered a great disappointment like a
girl who has either lost the man she loved or been cruelly deceived by
him though nothing of the kind had happened to her she was regarded in
that light and had even herself come to believe that she had suffered
much in life this melancholy which did not prevent her amusing
herself did not hinder the young people who came to her house from
passing the time pleasantly every visitor who came to the house paid
his tribute to the melancholy mood of the hostess and then amused
himself with society gossip dancing intellectual games and bouts
rimes which were in vogue at the karagins only a few of these young
men among them borís entered more deeply into julies melancholy and
with these she had prolonged conversations in private on the vanity of
all worldly things and to them she showed her albums filled with
mournful sketches maxims and verses

to borís julie was particularly gracious she regretted his early
disillusionment with life offered him such consolation of friendship as
she who had herself suffered so much could render and showed him her
album borís sketched two trees in the album and wrote rustic trees
your dark branches shed gloom and melancholy upon me

on another page he drew a tomb and wrote

la mort est secourable et la mort est tranquille ah contre les
douleurs il ny a pas dautre asile

 death gives relief and death is peaceful

ah from suffering there is no other refuge

julie said this was charming

there is something so enchanting in the smile of melancholy she said
to borís repeating word for word a passage she had copied from a book
it is a ray of light in the darkness a shade between sadness and
despair showing the possibility of consolation

in reply borís wrote these lines

aliment de poison dune ame trop sensible toi sans qui le bonheur me
serait impossible tendre melancholie ah viens me consoler viens
calmer les tourments de ma sombre retraite et mele une douceur secrete
a ces pleurs que je sens couler

poisonous nourishment of a too sensitive soul thou without whom
happiness would for me be impossible tender melancholy ah come to
console me come to calm the torments of my gloomy retreat and mingle a
secret sweetness with these tears that i feel to be flowing

for borís julie played most doleful nocturnes on her harp borís read
poor liza aloud to her and more than once interrupted the reading
because of the emotions that choked him meeting at large gatherings
julie and borís looked on one another as the only souls who understood
one another in a world of indifferent people

anna mikháylovna who often visited the karagins while playing cards
with the mother made careful inquiries as to julies dowry she was to
have two estates in penza and the nizhegorod forests anna mikháylovna
regarded the refined sadness that united her son to the wealthy julie
with emotion and resignation to the divine will

you are always charming and melancholy my dear julie she said to the
daughter borís says his soul finds repose at your house he has
suffered so many disappointments and is so sensitive said she to the
mother ah my dear i cant tell you how fond i have grown of julie
latterly she said to her son but who could help loving her she is
an angelic being ah borís borísshe paused and how i pity her
mother she went on today she showed me her accounts and letters from
penza they have enormous estates there and she poor thing has no
one to help her and they do cheat her so

borís smiled almost imperceptibly while listening to his mother he
laughed blandly at her naïve diplomacy but listened to what she had to
say and sometimes questioned her carefully about the penza and
nizhegorod estates

julie had long been expecting a proposal from her melancholy adorer and
was ready to accept it but some secret feeling of repulsion for her
for her passionate desire to get married for her artificiality and a
feeling of horror at renouncing the possibility of real love still
restrained borís his leave was expiring he spent every day and whole
days at the karagins and every day on thinking the matter over told
himself that he would propose tomorrow but in julies presence looking
at her red face and chin nearly always powdered her moist eyes and
her expression of continual readiness to pass at once from melancholy to
an unnatural rapture of married bliss borís could not utter the
decisive words though in imagination he had long regarded himself as
the possessor of those penza and nizhegorod estates and had apportioned
the use of the income from them julie saw borís indecision and
sometimes the thought occurred to her that she was repulsive to him but
her feminine selfdeception immediately supplied her with consolation
and she told herself that he was only shy from love her melancholy
however began to turn to irritability and not long before borís
departure she formed a definite plan of action just as borís leave of
absence was expiring anatole kurágin made his appearance in moscow and
of course in the karagins drawing room and julie suddenly abandoning
her melancholy became cheerful and very attentive to kurágin

my dear said anna mikháylovna to her son i know from a reliable
source that prince vasíli has sent his son to moscow to get him married
to julie i am so fond of julie that i should be sorry for her what do
you think of it my dear

the idea of being made a fool of and of having thrown away that whole
month of arduous melancholy service to julie and of seeing all the
revenue from the penza estates which he had already mentally apportioned
and put to proper use fall into the hands of another and especially
into the hands of that idiot anatole pained borís he drove to the
karagins with the firm intention of proposing julie met him in a gay
careless manner spoke casually of how she had enjoyed yesterdays ball
and asked when he was leaving though borís had come intentionally to
speak of his love and therefore meant to be tender he began speaking
irritably of feminine inconstancy of how easily women can turn from
sadness to joy and how their moods depend solely on who happens to be
paying court to them julie was offended and replied that it was true
that a woman needs variety and the same thing over and over again would
weary anyone

then i should advise you borís began wishing to sting her but at
that instant the galling thought occurred to him that he might have to
leave moscow without having accomplished his aim and have vainly wasted
his effortswhich was a thing he never allowed to happen

he checked himself in the middle of the sentence lowered his eyes to
avoid seeing her unpleasantly irritated and irresolute face and said

i did not come here at all to quarrel with you on the contrary

he glanced at her to make sure that he might go on her irritability had
suddenly quite vanished and her anxious imploring eyes were fixed on
him with greedy expectation i can always arrange so as not to see her
often thought borís the affair has been begun and must be finished
he blushed hotly raised his eyes to hers and said

you know my feelings for you

there was no need to say more julies face shone with triumph and self
satisfaction but she forced borís to say all that is said on such
occasionsthat he loved her and had never loved any other woman more
than her she knew that for the penza estates and nizhegorod forests she
could demand this and she received what she demanded

the affianced couple no longer alluding to trees that shed gloom and
melancholy upon them planned the arrangements of a splendid house in
petersburg paid calls and prepared everything for a brilliant wedding





chapter vi

at the end of january old count rostóv went to moscow with natásha and
sónya the countess was still unwell and unable to travel but it was
impossible to wait for her recovery prince andrew was expected in
moscow any day the trousseau had to be ordered and the estate near
moscow had to be sold besides which the opportunity of presenting his
future daughterinlaw to old prince bolkónski while he was in moscow
could not be missed the rostóvs moscow house had not been heated that
winter and as they had come only for a short time and the countess was
not with them the count decided to stay with márya dmítrievna
akhrosímova who had long been pressing her hospitality on them

late one evening the rostóvs four sleighs drove into márya dmítrievnas
courtyard in the old konyusheny street márya dmítrievna lived alone
she had already married off her daughter and her sons were all in the
service

she held herself as erect told everyone her opinion as candidly
loudly and bluntly as ever and her whole bearing seemed a reproach to
others for any weakness passion or temptationthe possibility of which
she did not admit from early in the morning wearing a dressing jacket
she attended to her household affairs and then she drove out on holy
days to church and after the service to jails and prisons on affairs of
which she never spoke to anyone on ordinary days after dressing she
received petitioners of various classes of whom there were always some
then she had dinner a substantial and appetizing meal at which there
were always three or four guests after dinner she played a game of
boston and at night she had the newspapers or a new book read to her
while she knitted she rarely made an exception and went out to pay
visits and then only to the most important persons in the town

she had not yet gone to bed when the rostóvs arrived and the pulley of
the hall door squeaked from the cold as it let in the rostóvs and their
servants márya dmítrievna with her spectacles hanging down on her nose
and her head flung back stood in the hall doorway looking with a stern
grim face at the new arrivals one might have thought she was angry with
the travelers and would immediately turn them out had she not at the
same time been giving careful instructions to the servants for the
accommodation of the visitors and their belongings

the counts things bring them here she said pointing to the
portmanteaus and not greeting anyone the young ladies there to the
left now what are you dawdling for she cried to the maids get the
samovar ready youve grown plumper and prettier she remarked
drawing natásha whose cheeks were glowing from the cold to her by the
hood foo you are cold now take off your things quick she shouted
to the count who was going to kiss her hand youre half frozen im
sure bring some rum for tea bonjour sónya dear she added
turning to sónya and indicating by this french greeting her slightly
contemptuous though affectionate attitude toward her

when they came in to tea having taken off their outdoor things and
tidied themselves up after their journey márya dmítrievna kissed them
all in due order

im heartily glad you have come and are staying with me it was high
time she said giving natásha a significant look the old man is here
and his sons expected any day youll have to make his acquaintance
but well speak of that later on she added glancing at sónya with a
look that showed she did not want to speak of it in her presence now
listen she said to the count what do you want tomorrow whom will
you send for shinshín she crooked one of her fingers the sniveling
anna mikháylovna thats two shes here with her son the son is
getting married then bezúkhov eh he is here too with his wife he
ran away from her and she came galloping after him he dined with me on
wednesday as for themand she pointed to the girlstomorrow ill take
them first to the iberian shrine of the mother of god and then well
drive to the superrogues i suppose youll have everything new dont
judge by me sleeves nowadays are this size the other day young
princess irina vasilevna came to see me she was an awful sightlooked
as if she had put two barrels on her arms you know not a day passes now
without some new fashion and what have you to do yourself she
asked the count sternly

one thing has come on top of another her rags to buy and now a
purchaser has turned up for the moscow estate and for the house if you
will be so kind ill fix a time and go down to the estate just for a
day and leave my lassies with you

all right all right theyll be safe with me as safe as in chancery
ill take them where they must go scold them a bit and pet them a
bit said márya dmítrievna touching her goddaughter and favorite
natásha on the cheek with her large hand

next morning márya dmítrievna took the young ladies to the iberian
shrine of the mother of god and to madame suppertroguet who was so
afraid of márya dmítrievna that she always let her have costumes at a
loss merely to get rid of her márya dmítrievna ordered almost the whole
trousseau when they got home she turned everybody out of the room
except natásha and then called her pet to her armchair

well now well talk i congratulate you on your betrothed youve
hooked a fine fellow i am glad for your sake and ive known him since
he was so high she held her hand a couple of feet from the ground
natásha blushed happily i like him and all his family now listen you
know that old prince nicholas much dislikes his sons marrying the old
fellows crotchety of course prince andrew is not a child and can shift
without him but its not nice to enter a family against a fathers
will one wants to do it peacefully and lovingly youre a clever girl
and youll know how to manage be kind and use your wits then all will
be well

natásha remained silent from shyness márya dmítrievna supposed but
really because she disliked anyone interfering in what touched her love
of prince andrew which seemed to her so apart from all human affairs
that no one could understand it she loved and knew prince andrew he
loved her only and was to come one of these days and take her she
wanted nothing more

you see i have known him a long time and am also fond of mary your
future sisterinlaw husbands sisters bring up blisters but this
one wouldnt hurt a fly she has asked me to bring you two together
tomorrow youll go with your father to see her be very nice and
affectionate to her youre younger than she when he comes hell find
you already know his sister and father and are liked by them am i right
or not wont that be best

yes it will natásha answered reluctantly





chapter vii

next day by márya dmítrievnas advice count rostóv took natásha to
call on prince nicholas bolkónski the count did not set out cheerfully
on this visit at heart he felt afraid he well remembered the last
interview he had had with the old prince at the time of the enrollment
when in reply to an invitation to dinner he had had to listen to an
angry reprimand for not having provided his full quota of men natásha
on the other hand having put on her best gown was in the highest
spirits they cant help liking me she thought everybody always has
liked me and i am so willing to do anything they wish so ready to be
fond of himfor being his fatherand of herfor being his sisterthat
there is no reason for them not to like me

they drove up to the gloomy old house on the vozdvizhenka and entered
the vestibule

well the lord have mercy on us said the count half in jest half in
earnest but natásha noticed that her father was flurried on entering
the anteroom and inquired timidly and softly whether the prince and
princess were at home

when they had been announced a perturbation was noticeable among the
servants the footman who had gone to announce them was stopped by
another in the large hall and they whispered to one another then a
maidservant ran into the hall and hurriedly said something mentioning
the princess at last an old cross looking footman came and announced
to the rostóvs that the prince was not receiving but that the princess
begged them to walk up the first person who came to meet the visitors
was mademoiselle bourienne she greeted the father and daughter with
special politeness and showed them to the princess room the princess
looking excited and nervous her face flushed in patches ran in to meet
the visitors treading heavily and vainly trying to appear cordial and
at ease from the first glance princess mary did not like natásha she
thought her too fashionably dressed frivolously gay and vain she did
not at all realize that before having seen her future sisterinlaw she
was prejudiced against her by involuntary envy of her beauty youth and
happiness as well as by jealousy of her brothers love for her apart
from this insuperable antipathy to her princess mary was agitated just
then because on the rostóvs being announced the old prince had shouted
that he did not wish to see them that princess mary might do so if she
chose but they were not to be admitted to him she had decided to
receive them but feared lest the prince might at any moment indulge in
some freak as he seemed much upset by the rostóvs visit

there my dear princess ive brought you my songstress said the
count bowing and looking round uneasily as if afraid the old prince
might appear i am so glad you should get to know one another very
sorry the prince is still ailing and after a few more commonplace
remarks he rose if youll allow me to leave my natásha in your hands
for a quarter of an hour princess ill drive round to see anna
semënovna its quite near in the dogs square and then ill come back
for her

the count had devised this diplomatic ruse as he afterwards told his
daughter to give the future sistersinlaw an opportunity to talk to
one another freely but another motive was to avoid the danger of
encountering the old prince of whom he was afraid he did not mention
this to his daughter but natásha noticed her fathers nervousness and
anxiety and felt mortified by it she blushed for him grew still
angrier at having blushed and looked at the princess with a bold and
defiant expression which said that she was not afraid of anybody the
princess told the count that she would be delighted and only begged him
to stay longer at anna semënovnas and he departed

despite the uneasy glances thrown at her by princess marywho wished to
have a têteàtête with natáshamademoiselle bourienne remained in the
room and persistently talked about moscow amusements and theaters
natásha felt offended by the hesitation she had noticed in the anteroom
by her fathers nervousness and by the unnatural manner of the princess
whoshe thoughtwas making a favor of receiving her and so everything
displeased her she did not like princess mary whom she thought very
plain affected and dry natásha suddenly shrank into herself and
involuntarily assumed an offhand air which alienated princess mary still
more after five minutes of irksome constrained conversation they
heard the sound of slippered feet rapidly approaching princess mary
looked frightened

the door opened and the old prince in a dressing gown and a white
nightcap came in

ah madam he began madam countess countess rostóva if i am not
mistaken i beg you to excuse me to excuse me i did not know
madam god is my witness i did not know you had honored us with a
visit and i came in such a costume only to see my daughter i beg you
to excuse me god is my witness i didnt know he repeated
stressing the word god so unnaturally and so unpleasantly that
princess mary stood with downcast eyes not daring to look either at her
father or at natásha

nor did the latter having risen and curtsied know what to do
mademoiselle bourienne alone smiled agreeably

i beg you to excuse me excuse me god is my witness i did not know
muttered the old man and after looking natásha over from head to foot
he went out

mademoiselle bourienne was the first to recover herself after this
apparition and began speaking about the princes indisposition natásha
and princess mary looked at one another in silence and the longer they
did so without saying what they wanted to say the greater grew their
antipathy to one another

when the count returned natásha was impolitely pleased and hastened to
get away at that moment she hated the stiff elderly princess who
could place her in such an embarrassing position and had spent half an
hour with her without once mentioning prince andrew i couldnt begin
talking about him in the presence of that frenchwoman thought natásha
the same thought was meanwhile tormenting princess mary she knew what
she ought to have said to natásha but she had been unable to say it
because mademoiselle bourienne was in the way and because without
knowing why she felt it very difficult to speak of the marriage when
the count was already leaving the room princess mary went up hurriedly
to natásha took her by the hand and said with a deep sigh

wait i must

natásha glanced at her ironically without knowing why

dear natalie said princess mary i want you to know that i am glad
my brother has found happiness

she paused feeling that she was not telling the truth natásha noticed
this and guessed its reason

i think princess it is not convenient to speak of that now she said
with external dignity and coldness though she felt the tears choking
her

what have i said and what have i done thought she as soon as she was
out of the room

they waited a long time for natásha to come to dinner that day she sat
in her room crying like a child blowing her nose and sobbing sónya
stood beside her kissing her hair

natásha what is it about she asked what do they matter to you it
will all pass natásha

but if you only knew how offensive it was as if i

dont talk about it natásha it wasnt your fault so why should you
mind kiss me said sónya

natásha raised her head and kissing her friend on the lips pressed her
wet face against her

i cant tell you i dont know no ones to blame said natáshaits
my fault but it all hurts terribly oh why doesnt he come

she came in to dinner with red eyes márya dmítrievna who knew how the
prince had received the rostóvs pretended not to notice how upset
natásha was and jested resolutely and loudly at table with the count and
the other guests





chapter viii

that evening the rostóvs went to the opera for which márya dmítrievna
had taken a box

natásha did not want to go but could not refuse márya dmítrievnas kind
offer which was intended expressly for her when she came ready dressed
into the ballroom to await her father and looking in the large mirror
there saw that she was pretty very pretty she felt even more sad but
it was a sweet tender sadness

o god if he were here now i would not behave as i did then but
differently i would not be silly and afraid of things i would simply
embrace him cling to him and make him look at me with those searching
inquiring eyes with which he has so often looked at me and then i would
make him laugh as he used to laugh and his eyeshow i see those eyes
thought natásha and what do his father and sister matter to me i love
him alone him him with that face and those eyes with his smile
manly and yet childlike no i had better not think of him not think
of him but forget him quite forget him for the present i cant bear
this waiting and i shall cry in a minute and she turned away from the
glass making an effort not to cry and how can sónya love nicholas so
calmly and quietly and wait so long and so patiently thought she
looking at sónya who also came in quite ready with a fan in her hand
no shes altogether different i cant

natásha at that moment felt so softened and tender that it was not
enough for her to love and know she was beloved she wanted now at
once to embrace the man she loved to speak and hear from him words of
love such as filled her heart while she sat in the carriage beside her
father pensively watching the lights of the street lamps flickering on
the frozen window she felt still sadder and more in love and forgot
where she was going and with whom having fallen into the line of
carriages the rostóvs carriage drove up to the theater its wheels
squeaking over the snow natásha and sónya holding up their dresses
jumped out quickly the count got out helped by the footmen and
passing among men and women who were entering and the program sellers
they all three went along the corridor to the first row of boxes
through the closed doors the music was already audible

natásha your hair whispered sónya

an attendant deferentially and quickly slipped before the ladies and
opened the door of their box the music sounded louder and through the
door rows of brightly lit boxes in which ladies sat with bare arms and
shoulders and noisy stalls brilliant with uniforms glittered before
their eyes a lady entering the next box shot a glance of feminine envy
at natásha the curtain had not yet risen and the overture was being
played natásha smoothing her gown went in with sónya and sat down
scanning the brilliant tiers of boxes opposite a sensation she had not
experienced for a long timethat of hundreds of eyes looking at her bare
arms and necksuddenly affected her both agreeably and disagreeably and
called up a whole crowd of memories desires and emotions associated
with that feeling

the two remarkably pretty girls natásha and sónya with count rostóv
who had not been seen in moscow for a long time attracted general
attention moreover everybody knew vaguely of natáshas engagement to
prince andrew and knew that the rostóvs had lived in the country ever
since and all looked with curiosity at a fiancee who was making one of
the best matches in russia

natáshas looks as everyone told her had improved in the country and
that evening thanks to her agitation she was particularly pretty she
struck those who saw her by her fullness of life and beauty combined
with her indifference to everything about her her black eyes looked at
the crowd without seeking anyone and her delicate arm bare to above
the elbow lay on the velvet edge of the box while evidently
unconsciously she opened and closed her hand in time to the music
crumpling her program look theres alenina said sónya with her
mother isnt it

dear me michael kirilovich has grown still stouter remarked the
count

look at our anna mikháylovnawhat a headdress she has on

the karagins julieand borís with them one can see at once that
theyre engaged

drubetskóy has proposed

oh yes i heard it today said shinshín coming into the rostóvs box

natásha looked in the direction in which her fathers eyes were turned
and saw julie sitting beside her mother with a happy look on her face
and a string of pearls round her thick red neckwhich natásha knew was
covered with powder behind them wearing a smile and leaning over with
an ear to julies mouth was borís handsome smoothly brushed head he
looked at the rostóvs from under his brows and said something smiling
to his betrothed

they are talking about us about me and him thought natásha and he
no doubt is calming her jealousy of me they neednt trouble themselves
if only they knew how little i am concerned about any of them

behind them sat anna mikháylovna wearing a green headdress and with a
happy look of resignation to the will of god on her face their box was
pervaded by that atmosphere of an affianced couple which natásha knew so
well and liked so much she turned away and suddenly remembered all that
had been so humiliating in her mornings visit

what right has he not to wish to receive me into his family oh better
not think of itnot till he comes back she told herself and began
looking at the faces some strange and some familiar in the stalls in
the front in the very center leaning back against the orchestra rail
stood dólokhov in a persian dress his curly hair brushed up into a huge
shock he stood in full view of the audience well aware that he was
attracting everyones attention yet as much at ease as though he were
in his own room around him thronged moscows most brilliant young men
whom he evidently dominated

the count laughing nudged the blushing sónya and pointed to her former
adorer

do you recognize him said he and where has he sprung from he
asked turning to shinshín didnt he vanish somewhere

he did replied shinshín he was in the caucasus and ran away from
there they say he has been acting as minister to some ruling prince in
persia where he killed the shahs brother now all the moscow ladies
are mad about him its dólokhov the persian that does it we never
hear a word but dólokhov is mentioned they swear by him they offer him
to you as they would a dish of choice sterlet dólokhov and anatole
kurágin have turned all our ladies heads

a tall beautiful woman with a mass of plaited hair and much exposed
plump white shoulders and neck round which she wore a double string of
large pearls entered the adjoining box rustling her heavy silk dress
and took a long time settling into her place

natásha involuntarily gazed at that neck those shoulders and pearls
and coiffure and admired the beauty of the shoulders and the pearls
while natásha was fixing her gaze on her for the second time the lady
looked round and meeting the counts eyes nodded to him and smiled
she was the countess bezúkhova pierres wife and the count who knew
everyone in society leaned over and spoke to her

have you been here long countess he inquired ill call ill call
to kiss your hand im here on business and have brought my girls with
me they say semënova acts marvelously count pierre never used to
forget us is he here

yes he meant to look in answered hélène and glanced attentively at
natásha

count rostóv resumed his seat

handsome isnt she he whispered to natásha

wonderful answered natásha shes a woman one could easily fall in
love with

just then the last chords of the overture were heard and the conductor
tapped with his stick some latecomers took their seats in the stalls
and the curtain rose

as soon as it rose everyone in the boxes and stalls became silent and
all the men old and young in uniform and evening dress and all the
women with gems on their bare flesh turned their whole attention with
eager curiosity to the stage natásha too began to look at it





chapter ix

the floor of the stage consisted of smooth boards at the sides was some
painted cardboard representing trees and at the back was a cloth
stretched over boards in the center of the stage sat some girls in red
bodices and white skirts one very fat girl in a white silk dress sat
apart on a low bench to the back of which a piece of green cardboard
was glued they all sang something when they had finished their song
the girl in white went up to the prompters box and a man with tight
silk trousers over his stout legs and holding a plume and a dagger
went up to her and began singing waving his arms about

first the man in the tight trousers sang alone then she sang then they
both paused while the orchestra played and the man fingered the hand of
the girl in white obviously awaiting the beat to start singing with
her they sang together and everyone in the theater began clapping and
shouting while the man and woman on the stagewho represented
loversbegan smiling spreading out their arms and bowing

after her life in the country and in her present serious mood all this
seemed grotesque and amazing to natásha she could not follow the opera
nor even listen to the music she saw only the painted cardboard and the
queerly dressed men and women who moved spoke and sang so strangely in
that brilliant light she knew what it was all meant to represent but
it was so pretentiously false and unnatural that she first felt ashamed
for the actors and then amused at them she looked at the faces of the
audience seeking in them the same sense of ridicule and perplexity she
herself experienced but they all seemed attentive to what was happening
on the stage and expressed delight which to natásha seemed feigned i
suppose it has to be like this she thought she kept looking round in
turn at the rows of pomaded heads in the stalls and then at the seminude
women in the boxes especially at hélène in the next box whoapparently
quite unclothedsat with a quiet tranquil smile not taking her eyes off
the stage and feeling the bright light that flooded the whole place and
the warm air heated by the crowd natásha little by little began to pass
into a state of intoxication she had not experienced for a long while
she did not realize who and where she was nor what was going on before
her as she looked and thought the strangest fancies unexpectedly and
disconnectedly passed through her mind the idea occurred to her of
jumping onto the edge of the box and singing the air the actress was
singing then she wished to touch with her fan an old gentleman sitting
not far from her then to lean over to hélène and tickle her

at a moment when all was quiet before the commencement of a song a door
leading to the stalls on the side nearest the rostóvs box creaked and
the steps of a belated arrival were heard theres kurágin whispered
shinshín countess bezúkhova turned smiling to the newcomer and
natásha following the direction of that look saw an exceptionally
handsome adjutant approaching their box with a selfassured yet
courteous bearing this was anatole kurágin whom she had seen and
noticed long ago at the ball in petersburg he was now in an adjutants
uniform with one epaulet and a shoulder knot he moved with a restrained
swagger which would have been ridiculous had he not been so goodlooking
and had his handsome face not worn such an expression of goodhumored
complacency and gaiety though the performance was proceeding he walked
deliberately down the carpeted gangway his sword and spurs slightly
jingling and his handsome perfumed head held high having looked at
natásha he approached his sister laid his well gloved hand on the edge
of her box nodded to her and leaning forward asked a question with a
motion toward natásha

mais charmante said he evidently referring to natásha who did not
exactly hear his words but understood them from the movement of his
lips then he took his place in the first row of the stalls and sat down
beside dólokhov nudging with his elbow in a friendly and offhand way
that dólokhov whom others treated so fawningly he winked at him gaily
smiled and rested his foot against the orchestra screen

how like the brother is to the sister remarked the count and how
handsome they both are

shinshín lowering his voice began to tell the count of some intrigue
of kurágins in moscow and natásha tried to overhear it just because he
had said she was charmante

the first act was over in the stalls everyone began moving about going
out and coming in

borís came to the rostóvs box received their congratulations very
simply and raising his eyebrows with an absentminded smile conveyed to
natásha and sónya his fiancees invitation to her wedding and went
away natásha with a gay coquettish smile talked to him and
congratulated on his approaching wedding that same borís with whom she
had formerly been in love in the state of intoxication she was in
everything seemed simple and natural

the scantily clad hélène smiled at everyone in the same way and natásha
gave borís a similar smile

hélènes box was filled and surrounded from the stalls by the most
distinguished and intellectual men who seemed to vie with one another
in their wish to let everyone see that they knew her

during the whole of that entracte kurágin stood with dólokhov in front
of the orchestra partition looking at the rostóvs box natásha knew he
was talking about her and this afforded her pleasure she even turned so
that he should see her profile in what she thought was its most becoming
aspect before the beginning of the second act pierre appeared in the
stalls the rostóvs had not seen him since their arrival his face
looked sad and he had grown still stouter since natásha last saw him
he passed up to the front rows not noticing anyone anatole went up to
him and began speaking to him looking at and indicating the rostóvs
box on seeing natásha pierre grew animated and hastily passing between
the rows came toward their box when he got there he leaned on his
elbows and smiling talked to her for a long time while conversing
with pierre natásha heard a mans voice in countess bezúkhovas box and
something told her it was kurágin she turned and their eyes met almost
smiling he gazed straight into her eyes with such an enraptured
caressing look that it seemed strange to be so near him to look at him
like that to be so sure he admired her and not to be acquainted with
him

in the second act there was scenery representing tombstones there was a
round hole in the canvas to represent the moon shades were raised over
the footlights and from horns and contrabass came deep notes while many
people appeared from right and left wearing black cloaks and holding
things like daggers in their hands they began waving their arms then
some other people ran in and began dragging away the maiden who had been
in white and was now in light blue they did not drag her away at once
but sang with her for a long time and then at last dragged her off and
behind the scenes something metallic was struck three times and everyone
knelt down and sang a prayer all these things were repeatedly
interrupted by the enthusiastic shouts of the audience

during this act every time natásha looked toward the stalls she saw
anatole kurágin with an arm thrown across the back of his chair staring
at her she was pleased to see that he was captivated by her and it did
not occur to her that there was anything wrong in it

when the second act was over countess bezúkhova rose turned to the
rostóvs boxher whole bosom completely exposedbeckoned the old count
with a gloved finger and paying no attention to those who had entered
her box began talking to him with an amiable smile

do make me acquainted with your charming daughters said she the
whole town is singing their praises and i dont even know them

natásha rose and curtsied to the splendid countess she was so pleased
by praise from this brilliant beauty that she blushed with pleasure

i want to become a moscovite too now said hélène how is it youre
not ashamed to bury such pearls in the country

countess bezúkhova quite deserved her reputation of being a fascinating
woman she could say what she did not thinkespecially what was
flatteringquite simply and naturally

dear count you must let me look after your daughters though i am not
staying here long this timenor are youi will try to amuse them i have
already heard much of you in petersburg and wanted to get to know you
said she to natásha with her stereotyped and lovely smile i had heard
about you from my page drubetskóy have you heard he is getting
married and also from my husbands friend bolkónski prince andrew
bolkónski she went on with special emphasis implying that she knew of
his relation to natásha to get better acquainted she asked that one of
the young ladies should come into her box for the rest of the
performance and natásha moved over to it

the scene of the third act represented a palace in which many candles
were burning and pictures of knights with short beards hung on the
walls in the middle stood what were probably a king and a queen the
king waved his right arm and evidently nervous sang something badly
and sat down on a crimson throne the maiden who had been first in white
and then in light blue now wore only a smock and stood beside the
throne with her hair down she sang something mournfully addressing the
queen but the king waved his arm severely and men and women with bare
legs came in from both sides and began dancing all together then the
violins played very shrilly and merrily and one of the women with thick
bare legs and thin arms separating from the others went behind the
wings adjusted her bodice returned to the middle of the stage and
began jumping and striking one foot rapidly against the other in the
stalls everyone clapped and shouted bravo then one of the men went
into a corner of the stage the cymbals and horns in the orchestra
struck up more loudly and this man with bare legs jumped very high and
waved his feet about very rapidly he was duport who received sixty
thousand rubles a year for this art everybody in the stalls boxes
and galleries began clapping and shouting with all their might and the
man stopped and began smiling and bowing to all sides then other men
and women danced with bare legs then the king again shouted to the
sound of music and they all began singing but suddenly a storm came
on chromatic scales and diminished sevenths were heard in the
orchestra everyone ran off again dragging one of their number away
and the curtain dropped once more there was a terrible noise and
clatter among the audience and with rapturous faces everyone began
shouting duport duport duport natásha no longer thought this
strange she looked about with pleasure smiling joyfully

isnt duport delightful hélène asked her

oh yes replied natásha





chapter x

during the entracte a whiff of cold air came into hélènes box the
door opened and anatole entered stooping and trying not to brush
against anyone

let me introduce my brother to you said hélène her eyes shifting
uneasily from natásha to anatole

natásha turned her pretty little head toward the elegant young officer
and smiled at him over her bare shoulder anatole who was as handsome
at close quarters as at a distance sat down beside her and told her he
had long wished to have this happinessever since the naryshkins ball
in fact at which he had had the wellremembered pleasure of seeing her
kurágin was much more sensible and simple with women than among men he
talked boldly and naturally and natásha was strangely and agreeably
struck by the fact that there was nothing formidable in this man about
whom there was so much talk but that on the contrary his smile was most
naïve cheerful and goodnatured

kurágin asked her opinion of the performance and told her how at a
previous performance semënova had fallen down on the stage

and do you know countess he said suddenly addressing her as an old
familiar acquaintance we are getting up a costume tournament you
ought to take part in it it will be great fun we shall all meet at the
karagins please come no really eh said he

while saying this he never removed his smiling eyes from her face her
neck and her bare arms natásha knew for certain that he was enraptured
by her this pleased her yet his presence made her feel constrained and
oppressed when she was not looking at him she felt that he was looking
at her shoulders and she involuntarily caught his eye so that he should
look into hers rather than this but looking into his eyes she was
frightened realizing that there was not that barrier of modesty she had
always felt between herself and other men she did not know how it was
that within five minutes she had come to feel herself terribly near to
this man when she turned away she feared he might seize her from behind
by her bare arm and kiss her on the neck they spoke of most ordinary
things yet she felt that they were closer to one another than she had
ever been to any man natásha kept turning to hélène and to her father
as if asking what it all meant but hélène was engaged in conversation
with a general and did not answer her look and her fathers eyes said
nothing but what they always said having a good time well im glad
of it

during one of these moments of awkward silence when anatoles prominent
eyes were gazing calmly and fixedly at her natásha to break the
silence asked him how he liked moscow she asked the question and
blushed she felt all the time that by talking to him she was doing
something improper anatole smiled as though to encourage her

at first i did not like it much because what makes a town pleasant ce
sont les jolies femmes  isnt that so but now i like it very much
indeed he said looking at her significantly youll come to the
costume tournament countess do come and putting out his hand to her
bouquet and dropping his voice he added you will be the prettiest
there do come dear countess and give me this flower as a pledge

 are the pretty women

natásha did not understand what he was saying any more than he did
himself but she felt that his incomprehensible words had an improper
intention she did not know what to say and turned away as if she had
not heard his remark but as soon as she had turned away she felt that
he was there behind so close behind her

how is he now confused angry ought i to put it right she asked
herself and she could not refrain from turning round she looked
straight into his eyes and his nearness selfassurance and the good
natured tenderness of his smile vanquished her she smiled just as he
was doing gazing straight into his eyes and again she felt with horror
that no barrier lay between him and her

the curtain rose again anatole left the box serene and gay natásha
went back to her father in the other box now quite submissive to the
world she found herself in all that was going on before her now seemed
quite natural but on the other hand all her previous thoughts of her
betrothed of princess mary or of life in the country did not once
recur to her mind and were as if belonging to a remote past

in the fourth act there was some sort of devil who sang waving his arm
about till the boards were withdrawn from under him and he disappeared
down below that was the only part of the fourth act that natásha saw
she felt agitated and tormented and the cause of this was kurágin whom
she could not help watching as they were leaving the theater anatole
came up to them called their carriage and helped them in as he was
putting natásha in he pressed her arm above the elbow agitated and
flushed she turned round he was looking at her with glittering eyes
smiling tenderly

only after she had reached home was natásha able clearly to think over
what had happened to her and suddenly remembering prince andrew she was
horrified and at tea to which all had sat down after the opera she
gave a loud exclamation flushed and ran out of the room

o god i am lost she said to herself how could i let him she sat
for a long time hiding her flushed face in her hands trying to realize
what had happened to her but was unable either to understand what had
happened or what she felt everything seemed dark obscure and
terrible there in that enormous illuminated theater where the bare
legged duport in a tinseldecorated jacket jumped about to the music
on wet boards and young girls and old men and the nearly naked hélène
with her proud calm smile rapturously cried bravothere in the
presence of that hélène it had all seemed clear and simple but now
alone by herself it was incomprehensible what is it what was that
terror i felt of him what is this gnawing of conscience i am feeling
now she thought

only to the old countess at night in bed could natásha have told all she
was feeling she knew that sónya with her severe and simple views would
either not understand it at all or would be horrified at such a
confession so natásha tried to solve what was torturing her by herself

am i spoiled for andrews love or not she asked herself and with
soothing irony replied what a fool i am to ask that what did happen
to me nothing i have done nothing i didnt lead him on at all nobody
will know and i shall never see him again she told herself so it is
plain that nothing has happened and there is nothing to repent of and
andrew can love me still but why still o god why isnt he here
natásha quieted herself for a moment but again some instinct told her
that though all this was true and though nothing had happened yet the
former purity of her love for prince andrew had perished and again in
imagination she went over her whole conversation with kurágin and again
saw the face gestures and tender smile of that bold handsome man when
he pressed her arm





chapter xi

anatole kurágin was staying in moscow because his father had sent him
away from petersburg where he had been spending twenty thousand rubles
a year in cash besides running up debts for as much more which his
creditors demanded from his father

his father announced to him that he would now pay half his debts for the
last time but only on condition that he went to moscow as adjutant to
the commanderinchiefa post his father had procured for himand would
at last try to make a good match there he indicated to him princess
mary and julie karágina

anatole consented and went to moscow where he put up at pierres house
pierre received him unwillingly at first but got used to him after a
while sometimes even accompanied him on his carousals and gave him
money under the guise of loans

as shinshín had remarked from the time of his arrival anatole had
turned the heads of the moscow ladies especially by the fact that he
slighted them and plainly preferred the gypsy girls and french
actresseswith the chief of whom mademoiselle george he was said to be
on intimate relations he had never missed a carousal at danilovs or
other moscow revelers drank whole nights through outvying everyone
else and was at all the balls and parties of the best society there
was talk of his intrigues with some of the ladies and he flirted with a
few of them at the balls but he did not run after the unmarried girls
especially the rich heiresses who were most of them plain there was a
special reason for this as he had got married two years beforea fact
known only to his most intimate friends at that time while with his
regiment in poland a polish landowner of small means had forced him to
marry his daughter anatole had very soon abandoned his wife and for a
payment which he agreed to send to his fatherinlaw had arranged to be
free to pass himself off as a bachelor

anatole was always content with his position with himself and with
others he was instinctively and thoroughly convinced that it was
impossible for him to live otherwise than as he did and that he had
never in his life done anything base he was incapable of considering
how his actions might affect others or what the consequences of this or
that action of his might be he was convinced that as a duck is so made
that it must live in water so god had made him such that he must spend
thirty thousand rubles a year and always occupy a prominent position in
society he believed this so firmly that others looking at him were
persuaded of it too and did not refuse him either a leading place in
society or money which he borrowed from anyone and everyone and
evidently would not repay

he was not a gambler at any rate he did not care about winning he was
not vain he did not mind what people thought of him still less could
he be accused of ambition more than once he had vexed his father by
spoiling his own career and he laughed at distinctions of all kinds he
was not mean and did not refuse anyone who asked of him all he cared
about was gaiety and women and as according to his ideas there was
nothing dishonorable in these tastes and he was incapable of
considering what the gratification of his tastes entailed for others he
honestly considered himself irreproachable sincerely despised rogues
and bad people and with a tranquil conscience carried his head high

rakes those male magdalenes have a secret feeling of innocence similar
to that which female magdalenes have based on the same hope of
forgiveness all will be forgiven her for she loved much and all will
be forgiven him for he enjoyed much

dólokhov who had reappeared that year in moscow after his exile and his
persian adventures and was leading a life of luxury gambling and
dissipation associated with his old petersburg comrade kurágin and made
use of him for his own ends

anatole was sincerely fond of dólokhov for his cleverness and audacity
dólokhov who needed anatole kurágins name position and connections
as a bait to draw rich young men into his gambling set made use of him
and amused himself at his expense without letting the other feel it
apart from the advantage he derived from anatole the very process of
dominating anothers will was in itself a pleasure a habit and a
necessity to dólokhov

natásha had made a strong impression on kurágin at supper after the
opera he described to dólokhov with the air of a connoisseur the
attractions of her arms shoulders feet and hair and expressed his
intention of making love to her anatole had no notion and was incapable
of considering what might come of such lovemaking as he never had any
notion of the outcome of any of his actions

shes firstrate my dear fellow but not for us replied dólokhov

i will tell my sister to ask her to dinner said anatole eh

youd better wait till shes married

you know i adore little girls they lose their heads at once pursued
anatole

you have been caught once already by a little girl said dólokhov
who knew of kurágins marriage take care

well that cant happen twice eh said anatole with a goodhumored
laugh





chapter xii

the day after the opera the rostóvs went nowhere and nobody came to see
them márya dmítrievna talked to the count about something which they
concealed from natásha natásha guessed they were talking about the old
prince and planning something and this disquieted and offended her she
was expecting prince andrew any moment and twice that day sent a
manservant to the vozdvizhenka to ascertain whether he had come he had
not arrived she suffered more now than during her first days in moscow
to her impatience and pining for him were now added the unpleasant
recollection of her interview with princess mary and the old prince and
a fear and anxiety of which she did not understand the cause she
continually fancied that either he would never come or that something
would happen to her before he came she could no longer think of him by
herself calmly and continuously as she had done before as soon as she
began to think of him the recollection of the old prince of princess
mary of the theater and of kurágin mingled with her thoughts the
question again presented itself whether she was not guilty whether she
had not already broken faith with prince andrew and again she found
herself recalling to the minutest detail every word every gesture and
every shade in the play of expression on the face of the man who had
been able to arouse in her such an incomprehensible and terrifying
feeling to the family natásha seemed livelier than usual but she was
far less tranquil and happy than before

on sunday morning márya dmítrievna invited her visitors to mass at her
parish churchthe church of the assumption built over the graves of
victims of the plague

i dont like those fashionable churches she said evidently priding
herself on her independence of thought god is the same everywhere we
have an excellent priest he conducts the service decently and with
dignity and the deacon is the same what holiness is there in giving
concerts in the choir i dont like it its just selfindulgence

márya dmítrievna liked sundays and knew how to keep them her whole
house was scrubbed and cleaned on saturdays neither she nor the
servants worked and they all wore holiday dress and went to church at
her table there were extra dishes at dinner and the servants had vodka
and roast goose or suckling pig but in nothing in the house was the
holiday so noticeable as in márya dmítrievnas broad stern face which
on that day wore an invariable look of solemn festivity

after mass when they had finished their coffee in the dining room where
the loose covers had been removed from the furniture a servant
announced that the carriage was ready and márya dmítrievna rose with a
stern air she wore her holiday shawl in which she paid calls and
announced that she was going to see prince nicholas bolkónski to have an
explanation with him about natásha

after she had gone a dressmaker from madame suppertroguet waited on
the rostóvs and natásha very glad of this diversion having shut
herself into a room adjoining the drawing room occupied herself trying
on the new dresses just as she had put on a bodice without sleeves and
only tacked together and was turning her head to see in the glass how
the back fitted she heard in the drawing room the animated sounds of
her fathers voice and anothersa womansthat made her flush it was
hélène natásha had not time to take off the bodice before the door
opened and countess bezúkhova dressed in a purple velvet gown with a
high collar came into the room beaming with goodhumored amiable
smiles

oh my enchantress she cried to the blushing natásha charming no
this is really beyond anything my dear count said she to count rostóv
who had followed her in how can you live in moscow and go nowhere no
i wont let you off mademoiselle george will recite at my house tonight
and therell be some people and if you dont bring your lovely
girlswho are prettier than mademoiselle georgei wont know you my
husband is away in tver or i would send him to fetch you you must come
you positively must between eight and nine

she nodded to the dressmaker whom she knew and who had curtsied
respectfully to her and seated herself in an armchair beside the
looking glass draping the folds of her velvet dress picturesquely she
did not cease chattering goodnaturedly and gaily continually praising
natáshas beauty she looked at natáshas dresses and praised them as
well as a new dress of her own made of metallic gauze which she had
received from paris and advised natásha to have one like it

but anything suits you my charmer she remarked

a smile of pleasure never left natáshas face she felt happy and as if
she were blossoming under the praise of this dear countess bezúkhova who
had formerly seemed to her so unapproachable and important and was now
so kind to her natásha brightened up and felt almost in love with this
woman who was so beautiful and so kind hélène for her part was
sincerely delighted with natásha and wished to give her a good time
anatole had asked her to bring him and natásha together and she was
calling on the rostóvs for that purpose the idea of throwing her
brother and natásha together amused her

though at one time in petersburg she had been annoyed with natásha for
drawing borís away she did not think of that now and in her own way
heartily wished natásha well as she was leaving the rostóvs she called
her protegee aside

my brother dined with me yesterdaywe nearly died of laughterhe ate
nothing and kept sighing for you my charmer he is madly quite madly
in love with you my dear

natásha blushed scarlet when she heard this

how she blushes how she blushes my pretty said hélène you must
certainly come if you love somebody my charmer that is not a reason
to shut yourself up even if you are engaged i am sure your fiance
would wish you to go into society rather than be bored to death

so she knows i am engaged and she and her husband pierrethat good
pierrehave talked and laughed about this so its all right and
again under hélènes influence what had seemed terrible now seemed
simple and natural and she is such a grande dame so kind and
evidently likes me so much and why not enjoy myself thought natásha
gazing at hélène with wideopen wondering eyes

márya dmítrievna came back to dinner taciturn and serious having
evidently suffered a defeat at the old princes she was still too
agitated by the encounter to be able to talk of the affair calmly in
answer to the counts inquiries she replied that things were all right
and that she would tell about it next day on hearing of countess
bezúkhovas visit and the invitation for that evening márya dmítrievna
remarked

i dont care to have anything to do with bezúkhova and dont advise you
to however if youve promisedgo it will divert your thoughts she
added addressing natásha





chapter xiii

count rostóv took the girls to countess bezúkhovas there were a good
many people there but nearly all strangers to natásha count rostóv was
displeased to see that the company consisted almost entirely of men and
women known for the freedom of their conduct mademoiselle george was
standing in a corner of the drawing room surrounded by young men there
were several frenchmen present among them metivier who from the time
hélène reached moscow had been an intimate in her house the count
decided not to sit down to cards or let his girls out of his sight and
to get away as soon as mademoiselle georges performance was over

anatole was at the door evidently on the lookout for the rostóvs
immediately after greeting the count he went up to natásha and followed
her as soon as she saw him she was seized by the same feeling she had
had at the operagratified vanity at his admiration of her and fear at
the absence of a moral barrier between them

hélène welcomed natásha delightedly and was loud in admiration of her
beauty and her dress soon after their arrival mademoiselle george went
out of the room to change her costume in the drawing room people began
arranging the chairs and taking their seats anatole moved a chair for
natásha and was about to sit down beside her but the count who never
lost sight of her took the seat himself anatole sat down behind her

mademoiselle george with her bare fat dimpled arms and a red shawl
draped over one shoulder came into the space left vacant for her and
assumed an unnatural pose enthusiastic whispering was audible

mademoiselle george looked sternly and gloomily at the audience and
began reciting some french verses describing her guilty love for her
son in some places she raised her voice in others she whispered
lifting her head triumphantly sometimes she paused and uttered hoarse
sounds rolling her eyes

adorable divine delicious was heard from every side

natásha looked at the fat actress but neither saw nor heard nor
understood anything of what went on before her she only felt herself
again completely borne away into this strange senseless worldso remote
from her old worlda world in which it was impossible to know what was
good or bad reasonable or senseless behind her sat anatole and
conscious of his proximity she experienced a frightened sense of
expectancy

after the first monologue the whole company rose and surrounded
mademoiselle george expressing their enthusiasm

how beautiful she is natásha remarked to her father who had also
risen and was moving through the crowd toward the actress

i dont think so when i look at you said anatole following natásha
he said this at a moment when she alone could hear him you are
enchanting from the moment i saw you i have never ceased

come come natásha said the count as he turned back for his
daughter how beautiful she is natásha without saying anything
stepped up to her father and looked at him with surprised inquiring
eyes

after giving several recitations mademoiselle george left and countess
bezúkhova asked her visitors into the ballroom

the count wished to go home but hélène entreated him not to spoil her
improvised ball and the rostóvs stayed on anatole asked natásha for a
valse and as they danced he pressed her waist and hand and told her she
was bewitching and that he loved her during the ecossaise which she
also danced with him anatole said nothing when they happened to be by
themselves but merely gazed at her natásha lifted her frightened eyes
to him but there was such confident tenderness in his affectionate look
and smile that she could not whilst looking at him say what she had to
say she lowered her eyes

dont say such things to me i am betrothed and love another she said
rapidly she glanced at him

anatole was not upset or pained by what she had said

dont speak to me of that what can i do said he i tell you i am
madly madly in love with you is it my fault that you are
enchanting its our turn to begin

natásha animated and excited looked about her with wideopen
frightened eyes and seemed merrier than usual she understood hardly
anything that went on that evening they danced the ecossaise and the
grossvater her father asked her to come home but she begged to remain
wherever she went and whomever she was speaking to she felt his eyes
upon her later on she recalled how she had asked her father to let her
go to the dressing room to rearrange her dress that hélène had followed
her and spoken laughingly of her brothers love and that she again met
anatole in the little sitting room hélène had disappeared leaving them
alone and anatole had taken her hand and said in a tender voice

i cannot come to visit you but is it possible that i shall never see
you i love you madly can i never and blocking her path he
brought his face close to hers

his large glittering masculine eyes were so close to hers that she saw
nothing but them

natalie he whispered inquiringly while she felt her hands being
painfully pressed natalie

i dont understand i have nothing to say her eyes replied

burning lips were pressed to hers and at the same instant she felt
herself released and hélènes footsteps and the rustle of her dress
were heard in the room natásha looked round at her and then red and
trembling threw a frightened look of inquiry at anatole and moved
toward the door

one word just one for gods sake cried anatole

she paused she so wanted a word from him that would explain to her what
had happened and to which she could find no answer

natalie just a word only one he kept repeating evidently not
knowing what to say and he repeated it till hélène came up to them

hélène returned with natásha to the drawing room the rostóvs went away
without staying for supper

after reaching home natásha did not sleep all night she was tormented
by the insoluble question whether she loved anatole or prince andrew
she loved prince andrewshe remembered distinctly how deeply she loved
him but she also loved anatole of that there was no doubt else how
could all this have happened thought she if after that i could
return his smile when saying goodby if i was able to let it come to
that it means that i loved him from the first it means that he is
kind noble and splendid and i could not help loving him what am i to
do if i love him and the other one too she asked herself unable to
find an answer to these terrible questions





chapter xiv

morning came with its cares and bustle everyone got up and began to
move about and talk dressmakers came again márya dmítrievna appeared
and they were called to breakfast natásha kept looking uneasily at
everybody with wideopen eyes as if wishing to intercept every glance
directed toward her and tried to appear the same as usual

after breakfast which was her best time márya dmítrievna sat down in
her armchair and called natásha and the count to her

well friends i have now thought the whole matter over and this is my
advice she began yesterday as you know i went to see prince
bolkónski well i had a talk with him he took it into his head to
begin shouting but i am not one to be shouted down i said what i had
to say

well and he asked the count

he hes crazy he did not want to listen but whats the use of
talking as it is we have worn the poor girl out said márya
dmítrievna my advice to you is finish your business and go back home
to otradnoe and wait there

oh no exclaimed natásha

yes go back said márya dmítrievna and wait there if your
betrothed comes here nowthere will be no avoiding a quarrel but alone
with the old man he will talk things over and then come on to you

count rostóv approved of this suggestion appreciating its
reasonableness if the old man came round it would be all the better to
visit him in moscow or at bald hills later on and if not the wedding
against his wishes could only be arranged at otradnoe

that is perfectly true and i am sorry i went to see him and took her
said the old count

no why be sorry being here you had to pay your respects but if he
wontthats his affair said márya dmítrievna looking for something
in her reticule besides the trousseau is ready so there is nothing
to wait for and what is not ready ill send after you though i dont
like letting you go it is the best way so go with gods blessing

having found what she was looking for in the reticule she handed it to
natásha it was a letter from princess mary

she has written to you how she torments herself poor thing shes
afraid you might think that she does not like you

but she doesnt like me said natásha

dont talk nonsense cried márya dmítrievna

i shant believe anyone i know she doesnt like me replied natásha
boldly as she took the letter and her face expressed a cold and angry
resolution that caused márya dmítrievna to look at her more intently and
to frown

dont answer like that my good girl she said what i say is true
write an answer natásha did not reply and went to her own room to read
princess marys letter

princess mary wrote that she was in despair at the misunderstanding that
had occurred between them whatever her fathers feelings might be she
begged natásha to believe that she could not help loving her as the one
chosen by her brother for whose happiness she was ready to sacrifice
everything

do not think however she wrote that my father is illdisposed
toward you he is an invalid and an old man who must be forgiven but he
is good and magnanimous and will love her who makes his son happy
princess mary went on to ask natásha to fix a time when she could see
her again

after reading the letter natásha sat down at the writing table to answer
it dear princess she wrote in french quickly and mechanically and
then paused what more could she write after all that had happened the
evening before yes yes all that has happened and now all is
changed she thought as she sat with the letter she had begun before
her must i break off with him must i really thats awful and to
escape from these dreadful thoughts she went to sónya and began sorting
patterns with her

after dinner natásha went to her room and again took up princess marys
letter can it be that it is all over she thought can it be that
all this has happened so quickly and has destroyed all that went
before she recalled her love for prince andrew in all its former
strength and at the same time felt that she loved kurágin she vividly
pictured herself as prince andrews wife and the scenes of happiness
with him she had so often repeated in her imagination and at the same
time aglow with excitement recalled every detail of yesterdays
interview with anatole

why could that not be as well she sometimes asked herself in complete
bewilderment only so could i be completely happy but now i have to
choose and i cant be happy without either of them only she thought
to tell prince andrew what has happened or to hide it from him are both
equally impossible but with that one nothing is spoiled but am i
really to abandon forever the joy of prince andrews love in which i
have lived so long

please miss whispered a maid entering the room with a mysterious
air a man told me to give you this and she handed natásha a letter

only for christs sake the girl went on as natásha without
thinking mechanically broke the seal and read a love letter from
anatole of which without taking in a word she understood only that it
was a letter from himfrom the man she loved yes she loved him or
else how could that have happened which had happened and how could she
have a love letter from him in her hand

with trembling hands natásha held that passionate love letter which
dólokhov had composed for anatole and as she read it she found in it an
echo of all that she herself imagined she was feeling

since yesterday evening my fate has been sealed to be loved by you or
to die there is no other way for me the letter began then he went on
to say that he knew her parents would not give her to himfor this there
were secret reasons he could reveal only to herbut that if she loved
him she need only say the word yes and no human power could hinder
their bliss love would conquer all he would steal her away and carry
her off to the ends of the earth

yes yes i love him thought natásha reading the letter for the
twentieth time and finding some peculiarly deep meaning in each word of
it

that evening márya dmítrievna was going to the akharovs and proposed to
take the girls with her natásha pleading a headache remained at home





chapter xv

on returning late in the evening sónya went to natáshas room and to
her surprise found her still dressed and asleep on the sofa open on the
table beside her lay anatoles letter sónya picked it up and read it

as she read she glanced at the sleeping natásha trying to find in her
face an explanation of what she was reading but did not find it her
face was calm gentle and happy clutching her breast to keep herself
from choking sónya pale and trembling with fear and agitation sat
down in an armchair and burst into tears

how was it i noticed nothing how could it go so far can she have left
off loving prince andrew and how could she let kurágin go to such
lengths he is a deceiver and a villain thats plain what will
nicholas dear noble nicholas do when he hears of it so this is the
meaning of her excited resolute unnatural look the day before
yesterday yesterday and today thought sónya but it cant be that
she loves him she probably opened the letter without knowing who it was
from probably she is offended by it she could not do such a thing

sónya wiped away her tears and went up to natásha again scanning her
face

natásha she said just audibly

natásha awoke and saw sónya

ah youre back

and with the decision and tenderness that often come at the moment of
awakening she embraced her friend but noticing sónyas look of
embarrassment her own face expressed confusion and suspicion

sónya youve read that letter she demanded

yes answered sónya softly

natásha smiled rapturously

no sónya i cant any longer she said i cant hide it from you any
longer you know we love one another sónya darling he writes
sónya

sónya stared openeyed at natásha unable to believe her ears

and bolkónski she asked

ah sónya if you only knew how happy i am cried natásha you dont
know what love is

but natásha can that be all over

natásha looked at sónya with wideopen eyes as if she could not grasp
the question

well then are you refusing prince andrew said sónya

oh you dont understand anything dont talk nonsense just listen
said natásha with momentary vexation

but i cant believe it insisted sónya i dont understand how is it
you have loved a man for a whole year and suddenly why you have only
seen him three times natásha i dont believe you youre joking in
three days to forget everything and so

three days said natásha it seems to me ive loved him a hundred
years it seems to me that i have never loved anyone before you cant
understand it sónya wait a bit sit here and natásha embraced and
kissed her

i had heard that it happens like this and you must have heard it too
but its only now that i feel such love its not the same as before as
soon as i saw him i felt he was my master and i his slave and that i
could not help loving him yes his slave whatever he orders i shall
do you dont understand that what can i do what can i do sónya
cried natásha with a happy yet frightened expression

but think what you are doing cried sónya i cant leave it like
this this secret correspondence how could you let him go so far
she went on with a horror and disgust she could hardly conceal

i told you that i have no will natásha replied why cant you
understand i love him

then i wont let it come to that i shall tell cried sónya
bursting into tears

what do you mean for gods sake if you tell you are my enemy
declared natásha you want me to be miserable you want us to be
separated

when she saw natáshas fright sónya shed tears of shame and pity for
her friend

but what has happened between you she asked what has he said to
you why doesnt he come to the house

natásha did not answer her questions

for gods sake sónya dont tell anyone dont torture me natásha
entreated remember no one ought to interfere in such matters i have
confided in you

but why this secrecy why doesnt he come to the house asked sónya
why doesnt he openly ask for your hand you know prince andrew gave
you complete freedomif it is really so but i dont believe it
natásha have you considered what these secret reasons can be

natásha looked at sónya with astonishment evidently this question
presented itself to her mind for the first time and she did not know how
to answer it

i dont know what the reasons are but there must be reasons

sónya sighed and shook her head incredulously

if there were reasons she began

but natásha guessing her doubts interrupted her in alarm

sónya one cant doubt him one cant one cant dont you
understand she cried

does he love you

does he love me natásha repeated with a smile of pity at her friends
lack of comprehension why you have read his letter and you have seen
him

but if he is dishonorable

he dishonorable if you only knew exclaimed natásha

if he is an honorable man he should either declare his intentions or
cease seeing you and if you wont do this i will i will write to him
and i will tell papa said sónya resolutely

but i cant live without him cried natásha

natásha i dont understand you and what are you saying think of your
father and of nicholas

i dont want anyone i dont love anyone but him how dare you say he
is dishonorable dont you know that i love him screamed natásha go
away sónya i dont want to quarrel with you but go for gods sake
go you see how i am suffering natásha cried angrily in a voice of
despair and repressed irritation sónya burst into sobs and ran from the
room

natásha went to the table and without a moments reflection wrote that
answer to princess mary which she had been unable to write all the
morning in this letter she said briefly that all their
misunderstandings were at an end that availing herself of the
magnanimity of prince andrew who when he went abroad had given her her
freedom she begged princess mary to forget everything and forgive her
if she had been to blame toward her but that she could not be his wife
at that moment this all seemed quite easy simple and clear to natásha

on friday the rostóvs were to return to the country but on wednesday
the count went with the prospective purchaser to his estate near moscow

on the day the count left sónya and natásha were invited to a big
dinner party at the karagins and márya dmítrievna took them there at
that party natásha again met anatole and sónya noticed that she spoke
to him trying not to be overheard and that all through dinner she was
more agitated than ever when they got home natásha was the first to
begin the explanation sónya expected

there sónya you were talking all sorts of nonsense about him
natásha began in a mild voice such as children use when they wish to be
praised we have had an explanation today

well what happened what did he say natásha how glad i am youre not
angry with me tell me everythingthe whole truth what did he say

natásha became thoughtful

oh sónya if you knew him as i do he said he asked me what i had
promised bolkónski he was glad i was free to refuse him

sónya sighed sorrowfully

but you havent refused bolkónski said she

perhaps i have perhaps all is over between me and bolkónski why do
you think so badly of me

i dont think anything only i dont understand this

wait a bit sónya youll understand everything youll see what a man
he is now dont think badly of me or of him i dont think badly of
anyone i love and pity everybody but what am i to do

sónya did not succumb to the tender tone natásha used toward her the
more emotional and ingratiating the expression of natáshas face became
the more serious and stern grew sónyas

natásha said she you asked me not to speak to you and i havent
spoken but now you yourself have begun i dont trust him natásha why
this secrecy

again again interrupted natásha

natásha i am afraid for you

afraid of what

i am afraid youre going to your ruin said sónya resolutely and was
herself horrified at what she had said

anger again showed in natáshas face

and ill go to my ruin i will as soon as possible its not your
business it wont be you but i wholl suffer leave me alone leave
me alone i hate you

natásha moaned sónya aghast

i hate you i hate you youre my enemy forever and natásha ran out
of the room

natásha did not speak to sónya again and avoided her with the same
expression of agitated surprise and guilt she went about the house
taking up now one occupation now another and at once abandoning them

hard as it was for sónya she watched her friend and did not let her out
of her sight

the day before the count was to return sónya noticed that natásha sat
by the drawing room window all the morning as if expecting something and
that she made a sign to an officer who drove past whom sónya took to be
anatole

sónya began watching her friend still more attentively and noticed that
at dinner and all that evening natásha was in a strange and unnatural
state she answered questions at random began sentences she did not
finish and laughed at everything

after tea sónya noticed a housemaid at natáshas door timidly waiting to
let her pass she let the girl go in and then listening at the door
learned that another letter had been delivered

then suddenly it became clear to sónya that natásha had some dreadful
plan for that evening sónya knocked at her door natásha did not let
her in

she will run away with him thought sónya she is capable of
anything there was something particularly pathetic and resolute in her
face today she cried as she said goodby to uncle sónya remembered
yes thats it she means to elope with him but what am i to do
thought she recalling all the signs that clearly indicated that natásha
had some terrible intention the count is away what am i to do write
to kurágin demanding an explanation but what is there to oblige him to
reply write to pierre as prince andrew asked me to in case of some
misfortune but perhaps she really has already refused bolkónskishe
sent a letter to princess mary yesterday and uncle is away to tell
márya dmítrievna who had such faith in natásha seemed to sónya terrible
well anyway thought sónya as she stood in the dark passage now or
never i must prove that i remember the familys goodness to me and that
i love nicholas yes if i dont sleep for three nights ill not leave
this passage and will hold her back by force and will and not let the
family be disgraced thought she





chapter xvi

anatole had lately moved to dólokhovs the plan for natalie rostóvas
abduction had been arranged and the preparations made by dólokhov a few
days before and on the day that sónya after listening at natáshas
door resolved to safeguard her it was to have been put into execution
natásha had promised to come out to kurágin at the back porch at ten
that evening kurágin was to put her into a troyka he would have ready
and to drive her forty miles to the village of kamenka where an
unfrocked priest was in readiness to perform a marriage ceremony over
them at kamenka a relay of horses was to wait which would take them to
the warsaw highroad and from there they would hasten abroad with post
horses

anatole had a passport an order for post horses ten thousand rubles he
had taken from his sister and another ten thousand borrowed with
dólokhovs help

two witnesses for the mock marriagekhvostikov a retired petty official
whom dólokhov made use of in his gambling transactions and makarin a
retired hussar a kindly weak fellow who had an unbounded affection for
kuráginwere sitting at tea in dólokhovs front room

in his large study the walls of which were hung to the ceiling with
persian rugs bearskins and weapons sat dólokhov in a traveling cloak
and high boots at an open desk on which lay an abacus and some bundles
of paper money anatole with uniform unbuttoned walked to and fro from
the room where the witnesses were sitting through the study to the room
behind where his french valet and others were packing the last of his
things dólokhov was counting the money and noting something down

well he said khvostikov must have two thousand

give it to him then said anatole

makarka their name for makarin will go through fire and water for
you for nothing so here are our accounts all settled said dólokhov
showing him the memorandum is that right

yes of course returned anatole evidently not listening to dólokhov
and looking straight before him with a smile that did not leave his
face

dólokhov banged down the lid of his desk and turned to anatole with an
ironic smile

do you know youd really better drop it all theres still time

fool retorted anatole dont talk nonsense if you only knew its
the devil knows what

no really give it up said dólokhov i am speaking seriously its
no joke this plot youve hatched

what teasing again go to the devil eh said anatole making a
grimace really its no time for your stupid jokes and he left the
room

dólokhov smiled contemptuously and condescendingly when anatole had gone
out

you wait a bit he called after him im not joking im talking
sense come here come here

anatole returned and looked at dólokhov trying to give him his
attention and evidently submitting to him involuntarily

now listen to me im telling you this for the last time why should i
joke about it did i hinder you who arranged everything for you who
found the priest and got the passport who raised the money i did it
all

well thank you for it do you think i am not grateful and anatole
sighed and embraced dólokhov

i helped you but all the same i must tell you the truth it is a
dangerous business and if you think about ita stupid business well
youll carry her offall right will they let it stop at that it will
come out that youre already married why theyll have you in the
criminal court

oh nonsense nonsense anatole ejaculated and again made a grimace
didnt i explain to you what and anatole with the partiality dull
witted people have for any conclusion they have reached by their own
reasoning repeated the argument he had already put to dólokhov a
hundred times didnt i explain to you that i have come to this
conclusion if this marriage is invalid he went on crooking one
finger then i have nothing to answer for but if it is valid no
matter abroad no one will know anything about it isnt that so and
dont talk to me dont dont

seriously youd better drop it youll only get yourself into a mess

go to the devil cried anatole and clutching his hair left the room
but returned at once and dropped into an armchair in front of dólokhov
with his feet turned under him its the very devil what feel how it
beats he took dólokhovs hand and put it on his heart what a foot
my dear fellow what a glance a goddess he added in french what

dólokhov with a cold smile and a gleam in his handsome insolent eyes
looked at himevidently wishing to get some more amusement out of him

well and when the moneys gone what then

what then eh repeated anatole sincerely perplexed by a thought of
the future what then then i dont know but why talk
nonsense he glanced at his watch its time

anatole went into the back room

now then nearly ready youre dawdling he shouted to the servants

dólokhov put away the money called a footman whom he ordered to bring
something for them to eat and drink before the journey and went into
the room where khvostikov and makarin were sitting

anatole lay on the sofa in the study leaning on his elbow and smiling
pensively while his handsome lips muttered tenderly to himself

come and eat something have a drink dólokhov shouted to him from the
other room

i dont want to answered anatole continuing to smile

come balaga is here

anatole rose and went into the dining room balaga was a famous troyka
driver who had known dólokhov and anatole some six years and had given
them good service with his troykas more than once when anatoles
regiment was stationed at tver he had taken him from tver in the
evening brought him to moscow by daybreak and driven him back again
the next night more than once he had enabled dólokhov to escape when
pursued more than once he had driven them through the town with gypsies
and ladykins as he called the cocottes more than once in their
service he had run over pedestrians and upset vehicles in the streets of
moscow and had always been protected from the consequences by my
gentlemen as he called them he had ruined more than one horse in their
service more than once they had beaten him and more than once they had
made him drunk on champagne and madeira which he loved and he knew
more than one thing about each of them which would long ago have sent an
ordinary man to siberia they often called balaga into their orgies and
made him drink and dance at the gypsies and more than one thousand
rubles of their money had passed through his hands in their service he
risked his skin and his life twenty times a year and in their service
had lost more horses than the money he had from them would buy but he
liked them liked that mad driving at twelve miles an hour liked
upsetting a driver or running down a pedestrian and flying at full
gallop through the moscow streets he liked to hear those wild tipsy
shouts behind him get on get on when it was impossible to go any
faster he liked giving a painful lash on the neck to some peasant who
more dead than alive was already hurrying out of his way real
gentlemen he considered them

anatole and dólokhov liked balaga too for his masterly driving and
because he liked the things they liked with others balaga bargained
charging twentyfive rubles for a two hours drive and rarely drove
himself generally letting his young men do so but with his gentlemen
he always drove himself and never demanded anything for his work only a
couple of times a yearwhen he knew from their valets that they had
money in handhe would turn up of a morning quite sober and with a deep
bow would ask them to help him the gentlemen always made him sit down

do help me out theodore ivanych sir or your excellency he would
say i am quite out of horses let me have what you can to go to the
fair

and anatole and dólokhov when they had money would give him a thousand
or a couple of thousand rubles

balaga was a fairhaired short and snubnosed peasant of about twenty
seven redfaced with a particularly red thick neck glittering little
eyes and a small beard he wore a fine darkblue silklined cloth
coat over a sheepskin

on entering the room now he crossed himself turning toward the front
corner of the room and went up to dólokhov holding out a small black
hand

theodore ivanych he said bowing

how dyou do friend well here he is

good day your excellency he said again holding out his hand to
anatole who had just come in

i say balaga said anatole putting his hands on the mans shoulders
do you care for me or not eh now do me a service what horses
have you come with eh

as your messenger ordered your special beasts replied balaga

well listen balaga drive all three to death but get me there in
three hours eh

when they are dead what shall i drive said balaga with a wink

mind ill smash your face in dont make jokes cried anatole
suddenly rolling his eyes

why joke said the driver laughing as if id grudge my gentlemen
anything as fast as ever the horses can gallop so fast well go

ah said anatole well sit down

yes sit down said dólokhov

ill stand theodore ivanych

sit down nonsense have a drink said anatole and filled a large
glass of madeira for him

the drivers eyes sparkled at the sight of the wine after refusing it
for manners sake he drank it and wiped his mouth with a red silk
handkerchief he took out of his cap

and when are we to start your excellency

well anatole looked at his watch well start at once mind
balaga youll get there in time eh

that depends on our luck in starting else why shouldnt we be there in
time replied balaga didnt we get you to tver in seven hours i
think you remember that your excellency

do you know one christmas i drove from tver said anatole smilingly
at the recollection and turning to makarin who gazed rapturously at him
with wideopen eyes will you believe it makarka it took ones breath
away the rate we flew we came across a train of loaded sleighs and
drove right over two of them eh

those were horses balaga continued the tale that time id harnessed
two young side horses with the bay in the shafts he went on turning
to dólokhov will you believe it theodore ivanych those animals flew
forty miles i couldnt hold them in my hands grew numb in the sharp
frost so that i threw down the reinscatch hold yourself your
excellency says i and i just tumbled on the bottom of the sleigh and
sprawled there it wasnt a case of urging them on there was no holding
them in till we reached the place the devils took us there in three
hours only the near one died of it





chapter xvii

anatole went out of the room and returned a few minutes later wearing a
fur coat girt with a silver belt and a sable cap jauntily set on one
side and very becoming to his handsome face having looked in a mirror
and standing before dólokhov in the same pose he had assumed before it
he lifted a glass of wine

well goodby theodore thank you for everything and farewell said
anatole well comrades and friends he considered for a moment
of my youth farewell he said turning to makarin and the others

though they were all going with him anatole evidently wished to make
something touching and solemn out of this address to his comrades he
spoke slowly in a loud voice and throwing out his chest slightly swayed
one leg

all take glasses you too balaga well comrades and friends of my
youth weve had our fling and lived and reveled eh and now when
shall we meet again i am going abroad we have had a good timenow
farewell lads to our health hurrah he cried and emptying his
glass flung it on the floor

to your health said balaga who also emptied his glass and wiped his
mouth with his handkerchief

makarin embraced anatole with tears in his eyes

ah prince how sorry i am to part from you

lets go lets go cried anatole

balaga was about to leave the room

no stop said anatole shut the door we have first to sit down
thats the way

they shut the door and all sat down

now quick march lads said anatole rising

joseph his valet handed him his sabretache and saber and they all
went out into the vestibule

and wheres the fur cloak asked dólokhov hey ignatka go to
matrena matrevna and ask her for the sable cloak i have heard what
elopements are like continued dólokhov with a wink why shell rush
out more dead than alive just in the things she is wearing if you delay
at all therell be tears and papa and mamma and shes frozen in a
minute and must go backbut you wrap the fur cloak round her first thing
and carry her to the sleigh

the valet brought a womans foxlined cloak

fool i told you the sable one hey matrena the sable he shouted so
that his voice rang far through the rooms

a handsome slim and palefaced gypsy girl with glittering black eyes
and curly blueblack hair wearing a red shawl ran out with a sable
mantle on her arm

here i dont grudge ittake it she said evidently afraid of her
master and yet regretful of her cloak

dólokhov without answering took the cloak threw it over matrena and
wrapped her up in it

thats the way said dólokhov and then so and he turned the collar
up round her head leaving only a little of the face uncovered and
then so do you see and he pushed anatoles head forward to meet the
gap left by the collar through which matrenas brilliant smile was
seen

well goodby matrena said anatole kissing her ah my revels here
are over remember me to steshka there goodby goodbye matrena
wish me luck

well prince may god give you great luck said matrena in her gypsy
accent

two troykas were standing before the porch and two young drivers were
holding the horses balaga took his seat in the front one and holding
his elbows high arranged the reins deliberately anatole and dólokhov
got in with him makarin khvostikov and a valet seated themselves in
the other sleigh

well are you ready asked balaga

go he cried twisting the reins round his hands and the troyka tore
down the nikitski boulevard

tproo get out of the way hi tproo the shouting of balaga and
of the sturdy young fellow seated on the box was all that could be
heard on the arbat square the troyka caught against a carriage
something cracked shouts were heard and the troyka flew along the
arbat street

after taking a turn along the podnovinski boulevard balaga began to
rein in and turning back drew up at the crossing of the old konyusheny
street

the young fellow on the box jumped down to hold the horses and anatole
and dólokhov went along the pavement when they reached the gate
dólokhov whistled the whistle was answered and a maidservant ran out

come into the courtyard or youll be seen shell come out directly
said she

dólokhov stayed by the gate anatole followed the maid into the
courtyard turned the corner and ran up into the porch

he was met by gabriel márya dmítrievnas gigantic footman

come to the mistress please said the footman in his deep bass
intercepting any retreat

to what mistress who are you asked anatole in a breathless whisper

kindly step in my orders are to bring you in

kurágin come back shouted dólokhov betrayed back

dólokhov after anatole entered had remained at the wicket gate and was
struggling with the yard porter who was trying to lock it with a last
desperate effort dólokhov pushed the porter aside and when anatole ran
back seized him by the arm pulled him through the wicket and ran back
with him to the troyka





chapter xviii

márya dmítrievna having found sónya weeping in the corridor made her
confess everything and intercepting the note to natásha she read it and
went into natáshas room with it in her hand

you shameless goodfornothing said she i wont hear a word

pushing back natásha who looked at her with astonished but tearless
eyes she locked her in and having given orders to the yard porter to
admit the persons who would be coming that evening but not to let them
out again and having told the footman to bring them up to her she
seated herself in the drawing room to await the abductors

when gabriel came to inform her that the men who had come had run away
again she rose frowning and clasping her hands behind her paced
through the rooms a long time considering what she should do toward
midnight she went to natáshas room fingering the key in her pocket
sónya was sitting sobbing in the corridor márya dmítrievna for gods
sake let me in to her she pleaded but márya dmítrievna unlocked the
door and went in without giving her an answer disgusting
abominable in my house horrid girl hussy im only sorry for her
father thought she trying to restrain her wrath hard as it may be
ill tell them all to hold their tongues and will hide it from the
count she entered the room with resolute steps natásha lying on the
sofa her head hidden in her hands and she did not stir she was in
just the same position in which márya dmítrievna had left her

a nice girl very nice said márya dmítrievna arranging meetings
with lovers in my house its no use pretending you listen when i speak
to you and márya dmítrievna touched her arm listen when i speak
youve disgraced yourself like the lowest of hussies id treat you
differently but im sorry for your father so i will conceal it

natásha did not change her position but her whole body heaved with
noiseless convulsive sobs which choked her márya dmítrievna glanced
round at sónya and seated herself on the sofa beside natásha

its lucky for him that he escaped me but ill find him she said in
her rough voice do you hear what i am saying or not she added

she put her large hand under natáshas face and turned it toward her
both márya dmítrievna and sónya were amazed when they saw how natásha
looked her eyes were dry and glistening her lips compressed her
cheeks sunken

let me be what is it to me i shall die she muttered
wrenching herself from márya dmítrievnas hands with a vicious effort
and sinking down again into her former position

natalie said márya dmítrievna i wish for your good lie still stay
like that then i wont touch you but listen i wont tell you how
guilty you are you know that yourself but when your father comes back
tomorrow what am i to tell him eh

again natáshas body shook with sobs

suppose he finds out and your brother and your betrothed

i have no betrothed i have refused him cried natásha

thats all the same continued márya dmítrievna if they hear of
this will they let it pass he your father i know him if he
challenges him to a duel will that be all right eh

oh let me be why have you interfered at all why why who asked you
to shouted natásha raising herself on the sofa and looking
malignantly at márya dmítrievna

but what did you want cried márya dmítrievna growing angry again
were you kept under lock and key who hindered his coming to the house
why carry you off as if you were some gypsy singing girl well if he
had carried you off do you think they wouldnt have found him your
father or brother or your betrothed and hes a scoundrel a
wretchthats a fact

he is better than any of you exclaimed natásha getting up if you
hadnt interfered oh my god what is it all what is it sónya
why go away

and she burst into sobs with the despairing vehemence with which people
bewail disasters they feel they have themselves occasioned márya
dmítrievna was to speak again but natásha cried out

go away go away you all hate and despise me and she threw herself
back on the sofa

márya dmítrievna went on admonishing her for some time enjoining on her
that it must all be kept from her father and assuring her that nobody
would know anything about it if only natásha herself would undertake to
forget it all and not let anyone see that something had happened
natásha did not reply nor did she sob any longer but she grew cold and
had a shivering fit márya dmítrievna put a pillow under her head
covered her with two quilts and herself brought her some limeflower
water but natásha did not respond to her

well let her sleep said márya dmítrievna as she went out of the room
supposing natásha to be asleep

but natásha was not asleep with pale face and fixed wideopen eyes she
looked straight before her all that night she did not sleep or weep and
did not speak to sónya who got up and went to her several times

next day count rostóv returned from his estate near moscow in time for
lunch as he had promised he was in very good spirits the affair with
the purchaser was going on satisfactorily and there was nothing to keep
him any longer in moscow away from the countess whom he missed márya
dmítrievna met him and told him that natásha had been very unwell the
day before and that they had sent for the doctor but that she was
better now natásha had not left her room that morning with compressed
and parched lips and dry fixed eyes she sat at the window uneasily
watching the people who drove past and hurriedly glancing round at
anyone who entered the room she was evidently expecting news of him and
that he would come or would write to her

when the count came to see her she turned anxiously round at the sound
of a mans footstep and then her face resumed its cold and malevolent
expression she did not even get up to greet him what is the matter
with you my angel are you ill asked the count

after a moments silence natásha answered yes ill

in reply to the counts anxious inquiries as to why she was so dejected
and whether anything had happened to her betrothed she assured him that
nothing had happened and asked him not to worry márya dmítrievna
confirmed natáshas assurances that nothing had happened from the
pretense of illness from his daughters distress and by the
embarrassed faces of sónya and márya dmítrievna the count saw clearly
that something had gone wrong during his absence but it was so terrible
for him to think that anything disgraceful had happened to his beloved
daughter and he so prized his own cheerful tranquillity that he
avoided inquiries and tried to assure himself that nothing particularly
had happened and he was only dissatisfied that her indisposition
delayed their return to the country





chapter xix

from the day his wife arrived in moscow pierre had been intending to go
away somewhere so as not to be near her soon after the rostóvs came to
moscow the effect natásha had on him made him hasten to carry out his
intention he went to tver to see joseph alexeevichs widow who had
long since promised to hand over to him some papers of her deceased
husbands

when he returned to moscow pierre was handed a letter from márya
dmítrievna asking him to come and see her on a matter of great
importance relating to andrew bolkónski and his betrothed pierre had
been avoiding natásha because it seemed to him that his feeling for her
was stronger than a married mans should be for his friends fiancee
yet some fate constantly threw them together

what can have happened and what can they want with me thought he as
he dressed to go to márya dmítrievnas if only prince andrew would
hurry up and come and marry her thought he on his way to the house

on the tverskoy boulevard a familiar voice called to him

pierre been back long someone shouted pierre raised his head in a
sleigh drawn by two gray trottinghorses that were bespattering the
dashboard with snow anatole and his constant companion makarin dashed
past anatole was sitting upright in the classic pose of military
dandies the lower part of his face hidden by his beaver collar and his
head slightly bent his face was fresh and rosy his whiteplumed hat
tilted to one side disclosed his curled and pomaded hair besprinkled
with powdery snow

yes indeed thats a true sage thought pierre he sees nothing
beyond the pleasure of the moment nothing troubles him and so he is
always cheerful satisfied and serene what wouldnt i give to be like
him he thought enviously

in márya dmítrievnas anteroom the footman who helped him off with his
fur coat said that the mistress asked him to come to her bedroom

when he opened the ballroom door pierre saw natásha sitting at the
window with a thin pale and spiteful face she glanced round at him
frowned and left the room with an expression of cold dignity

what has happened asked pierre entering márya dmítrievnas room

fine doings answered dmítrievna for fiftyeight years have i lived
in this world and never known anything so disgraceful

and having put him on his honor not to repeat anything she told him
márya dmítrievna informed him that natásha had refused prince andrew
without her parents knowledge and that the cause of this was anatole
kurágin into whose society pierres wife had thrown her and with whom
natásha had tried to elope during her fathers absence in order to be
married secretly

pierre raised his shoulders and listened openmouthed to what was told
him scarcely able to believe his own ears that prince andrews deeply
loved affianced wifethe same natásha rostóva who used to be so
charmingshould give up bolkónski for that fool anatole who was already
secretly married as pierre knew and should be so in love with him as
to agree to run away with him was something pierre could not conceive
and could not imagine

he could not reconcile the charming impression he had of natásha whom
he had known from a child with this new conception of her baseness
folly and cruelty he thought of his wife they are all alike he
said to himself reflecting that he was not the only man unfortunate
enough to be tied to a bad woman but still he pitied prince andrew to
the point of tears and sympathized with his wounded pride and the more
he pitied his friend the more did he think with contempt and even with
disgust of that natásha who had just passed him in the ballroom with
such a look of cold dignity he did not know that natáshas soul was
overflowing with despair shame and humiliation and that it was not
her fault that her face happened to assume an expression of calm dignity
and severity

but how get married said pierre in answer to márya dmítrievna he
could not marryhe is married

things get worse from hour to hour ejaculated márya dmítrievna a
nice youth what a scoundrel and shes expecting himexpecting him
since yesterday she must be told then at least she wont go on
expecting him

after hearing the details of anatoles marriage from pierre and giving
vent to her anger against anatole in words of abuse márya dmítrievna
told pierre why she had sent for him she was afraid that the count or
bolkónski who might arrive at any moment if they knew of this affair
which she hoped to hide from them might challenge anatole to a duel
and she therefore asked pierre to tell his brotherinlaw in her name to
leave moscow and not dare to let her set eyes on him again pierreonly
now realizing the danger to the old count nicholas and prince
andrewpromised to do as she wished having briefly and exactly
explained her wishes to him she let him go to the drawing room

mind the count knows nothing behave as if you know nothing either
she said and i will go and tell her it is no use expecting him and
stay to dinner if you care to she called after pierre

pierre met the old count who seemed nervous and upset that morning
natásha had told him that she had rejected bolkónski

troubles troubles my dear fellow he said to pierre what troubles
one has with these girls without their mother i do so regret having
come here i will be frank with you have you heard she has broken
off her engagement without consulting anybody its true this engagement
never was much to my liking of course he is an excellent man but
still with his fathers disapproval they wouldnt have been happy and
natásha wont lack suitors still it has been going on so long and to
take such a step without fathers or mothers consent and now shes
ill and god knows what its hard count hard to manage daughters in
their mothers absence

pierre saw that the count was much upset and tried to change the
subject but the count returned to his troubles

sónya entered the room with an agitated face

natásha is not quite well shes in her room and would like to see you
márya dmítrievna is with her and she too asks you to come

yes you are a great friend of bolkónskis no doubt she wants to send
him a message said the count oh dear oh dear how happy it all
was

and clutching the spare gray locks on his temples the count left the
room

when márya dmítrievna told natásha that anatole was married natásha did
not wish to believe it and insisted on having it confirmed by pierre
himself sónya told pierre this as she led him along the corridor to
natáshas room

natásha pale and stern was sitting beside márya dmítrievna and her
eyes glittering feverishly met pierre with a questioning look the
moment he entered she did not smile or nod but only gazed fixedly at
him and her look asked only one thing was he a friend or like the
others an enemy in regard to anatole as for pierre he evidently did
not exist for her

he knows all about it said márya dmítrievna pointing to pierre and
addressing natásha let him tell you whether i have told the truth

natásha looked from one to the other as a hunted and wounded animal
looks at the approaching dogs and sportsmen

natálya ilyníchna pierre began dropping his eyes with a feeling of
pity for her and loathing for the thing he had to do whether it is
true or not should make no difference to you because

then it is not true that hes married

yes it is true

has he been married long she asked on your honor

pierre gave his word of honor

is he still here she asked quickly

yes i have just seen him

she was evidently unable to speak and made a sign with her hands that
they should leave her alone





chapter xx

pierre did not stay for dinner but left the room and went away at once
he drove through the town seeking anatole kurágin at the thought of
whom now the blood rushed to his heart and he felt a difficulty in
breathing he was not at the ice hills nor at the gypsies nor at
komonenos pierre drove to the club in the club all was going on as
usual the members who were assembling for dinner were sitting about in
groups they greeted pierre and spoke of the town news the footman
having greeted him knowing his habits and his acquaintances told him
there was a place left for him in the small dining room and that prince
michael zakharych was in the library but paul timofeevich had not yet
arrived one of pierres acquaintances while they were talking about
the weather asked if he had heard of kurágins abduction of rostóva
which was talked of in the town and was it true pierre laughed and
said it was nonsense for he had just come from the rostóvs he asked
everyone about anatole one man told him he had not come yet and
another that he was coming to dinner pierre felt it strange to see this
calm indifferent crowd of people unaware of what was going on in his
soul he paced through the ballroom waited till everyone had come and
as anatole had not turned up did not stay for dinner but drove home

anatole for whom pierre was looking dined that day with dólokhov
consulting him as to how to remedy this unfortunate affair it seemed to
him essential to see natásha in the evening he drove to his sisters to
discuss with her how to arrange a meeting when pierre returned home
after vainly hunting all over moscow his valet informed him that prince
anatole was with the countess the countess drawing room was full of
guests

pierre without greeting his wife whom he had not seen since his
returnat that moment she was more repulsive to him than everentered
the drawing room and seeing anatole went up to him

ah pierre said the countess going up to her husband you dont know
what a plight our anatole

she stopped seeing in the forward thrust of her husbands head in his
glowing eyes and his resolute gait the terrible indications of that
rage and strength which she knew and had herself experienced after his
duel with dólokhov

where you are there is vice and evil said pierre to his wife
anatole come with me i must speak to you he added in french

anatole glanced round at his sister and rose submissively ready to
follow pierre pierre taking him by the arm pulled him toward himself
and was leading him from the room

if you allow yourself in my drawing room whispered hélène but
pierre did not reply and went out of the room

anatole followed him with his usual jaunty step but his face betrayed
anxiety

having entered his study pierre closed the door and addressed anatole
without looking at him

you promised countess rostóva to marry her and were about to elope with
her is that so

mon cher answered anatole their whole conversation was in french
i dont consider myself bound to answer questions put to me in that
tone

pierres face already pale became distorted by fury he seized anatole
by the collar of his uniform with his big hand and shook him from side
to side till anatoles face showed a sufficient degree of terror

when i tell you that i must talk to you repeated pierre

come now this is stupid what said anatole fingering a button of
his collar that had been wrenched loose with a bit of the cloth

youre a scoundrel and a blackguard and i dont know what deprives me
from the pleasure of smashing your head with this said pierre
expressing himself so artificially because he was talking french

he took a heavy paperweight and lifted it threateningly but at once put
it back in its place

did you promise to marry her

i i didnt think of it i never promised because

pierre interrupted him

have you any letters of hers any letters he said moving toward
anatole

anatole glanced at him and immediately thrust his hand into his pocket
and drew out his pocketbook

pierre took the letter anatole handed him and pushing aside a table
that stood in his way threw himself on the sofa

i shant be violent dont be afraid said pierre in answer to a
frightened gesture of anatoles first the letters said he as if
repeating a lesson to himself secondly he continued after a short
pause again rising and again pacing the room tomorrow you must get
out of moscow

but how can i

thirdly pierre continued without listening to him you must never
breathe a word of what has passed between you and countess rostóva i
know i cant prevent your doing so but if you have a spark of
conscience pierre paced the room several times in silence

anatole sat at a table frowning and biting his lips

after all you must understand that besides your pleasure there is such
a thing as other peoples happiness and peace and that you are ruining
a whole life for the sake of amusing yourself amuse yourself with women
like my wifewith them you are within your rights for they know what
you want of them they are armed against you by the same experience of
debauchery but to promise a maid to marry her to deceive to
kidnap dont you understand that it is as mean as beating an old man
or a child

pierre paused and looked at anatole no longer with an angry but with a
questioning look

i dont know about that eh said anatole growing more confident as
pierre mastered his wrath i dont know that and dont want to he
said not looking at pierre and with a slight tremor of his lower jaw
but you have used such words to memean and so onwhich as a man of
honor i cant allow anyone to use

pierre glanced at him with amazement unable to understand what he
wanted

though it was têteàtête anatole continued still i cant

is it satisfaction you want said pierre ironically

you could at least take back your words what if you want me to do as
you wish eh

i take them back i take them back said pierre and i ask you to
forgive me pierre involuntarily glanced at the loose button and if
you require money for your journey

anatole smiled the expression of that base and cringing smile which
pierre knew so well in his wife revolted him

oh vile and heartless brood he exclaimed and left the room

next day anatole left for petersburg





chapter xxi

pierre drove to márya dmítrievnas to tell her of the fulfillment of her
wish that kurágin should be banished from moscow the whole house was in
a state of alarm and commotion natásha was very ill having as márya
dmítrievna told him in secret poisoned herself the night after she had
been told that anatole was married with some arsenic she had stealthily
procured after swallowing a little she had been so frightened that she
woke sónya and told her what she had done the necessary antidotes had
been administered in time and she was now out of danger though still so
weak that it was out of the question to move her to the country and so
the countess had been sent for pierre saw the distracted count and
sónya who had a tearstained face but he could not see natásha

pierre dined at the club that day and heard on all sides gossip about
the attempted abduction of rostóva he resolutely denied these rumors
assuring everyone that nothing had happened except that his brotherin
law had proposed to her and been refused it seemed to pierre that it
was his duty to conceal the whole affair and reestablish natáshas
reputation

he was awaiting prince andrews return with dread and went every day to
the old princes for news of him

old prince bolkónski heard all the rumors current in the town from
mademoiselle bourienne and had read the note to princess mary in which
natásha had broken off her engagement he seemed in better spirits than
usual and awaited his son with great impatience

some days after anatoles departure pierre received a note from prince
andrew informing him of his arrival and asking him to come to see him

as soon as he reached moscow prince andrew had received from his father
natáshas note to princess mary breaking off her engagement
mademoiselle bourienne had purloined it from princess mary and given it
to the old prince and he heard from him the story of natáshas
elopement with additions

prince andrew had arrived in the evening and pierre came to see him next
morning pierre expected to find prince andrew in almost the same state
as natásha and was therefore surprised on entering the drawing room to
hear him in the study talking in a loud animated voice about some
intrigue going on in petersburg the old princes voice and another now
and then interrupted him princess mary came out to meet pierre she
sighed looking toward the door of the room where prince andrew was
evidently intending to express her sympathy with his sorrow but pierre
saw by her face that she was glad both at what had happened and at the
way her brother had taken the news of natáshas faithlessness

he says he expected it she remarked i know his pride will not let
him express his feelings but still he has taken it better far better
than i expected evidently it had to be

but is it possible that all is really ended asked pierre

princess mary looked at him with astonishment she did not understand
how he could ask such a question pierre went into the study prince
andrew greatly changed and plainly in better health but with a fresh
horizontal wrinkle between his brows stood in civilian dress facing his
father and prince meshcherski warmly disputing and vigorously
gesticulating the conversation was about speranskithe news of whose
sudden exile and alleged treachery had just reached moscow

now he is censured and accused by all who were enthusiastic about him a
month ago prince andrew was saying and by those who were unable to
understand his aims to judge a man who is in disfavor and to throw on
him all the blame of other mens mistakes is very easy but i maintain
that if anything good has been accomplished in this reign it was done by
him by him alone

he paused at the sight of pierre his face quivered and immediately
assumed a vindictive expression

posterity will do him justice he concluded and at once turned to
pierre

well how are you still getting stouter he said with animation but
the new wrinkle on his forehead deepened yes i am well he said in
answer to pierres question and smiled

to pierre that smile said plainly i am well but my health is now of
no use to anyone

after a few words to pierre about the awful roads from the polish
frontier about people he had met in switzerland who knew pierre and
about m dessalles whom he had brought from abroad to be his sons
tutor prince andrew again joined warmly in the conversation about
speranski which was still going on between the two old men

if there were treason or proofs of secret relations with napoleon
they would have been made public he said with warmth and haste i do
not and never did like speranski personally but i like justice

pierre now recognized in his friend a need with which he was only too
familiar to get excited and to have arguments about extraneous matters
in order to stifle thoughts that were too oppressive and too intimate
when prince meshcherski had left prince andrew took pierres arm and
asked him into the room that had been assigned him a bed had been made
up there and some open portmanteaus and trunks stood about prince
andrew went to one and took out a small casket from which he drew a
packet wrapped in paper he did it all silently and very quickly he
stood up and coughed his face was gloomy and his lips compressed

forgive me for troubling you

pierre saw that prince andrew was going to speak of natásha and his
broad face expressed pity and sympathy this expression irritated prince
andrew and in a determined ringing and unpleasant tone he continued

i have received a refusal from countess rostóva and have heard reports
of your brotherinlaw having sought her hand or something of that
kind is that true

both true and untrue pierre began but prince andrew interrupted him

here are her letters and her portrait said he

he took the packet from the table and handed it to pierre

give this to the countess if you see her

she is very ill said pierre

then she is here still said prince andrew and prince kurágin he
added quickly

he left long ago she has been at deaths door

i much regret her illness said prince andrew and he smiled like his
father coldly maliciously and unpleasantly

so monsieur kurágin has not honored countess rostóva with his hand
said prince andrew and he snorted several times

he could not marry for he was married already said pierre

prince andrew laughed disagreeably again reminding one of his father

and where is your brotherinlaw now if i may ask he said

he has gone to peters but i dont know said pierre

well it doesnt matter said prince andrew tell countess rostóva
that she was and is perfectly free and that i wish her all that is
good

pierre took the packet prince andrew as if trying to remember whether
he had something more to say or waiting to see if pierre would say
anything looked fixedly at him

i say do you remember our discussion in petersburg asked pierre
about

yes returned prince andrew hastily i said that a fallen woman
should be forgiven but i didnt say i could forgive her i cant

but can this be compared said pierre

prince andrew interrupted him and cried sharply yes ask her hand
again be magnanimous and so on yes that would be very noble but
i am unable to follow in that gentlemans footsteps if you wish to be
my friend never speak to me of that of all that well goodby so
youll give her the packet

pierre left the room and went to the old prince and princess mary

the old man seemed livelier than usual princess mary was the same as
always but beneath her sympathy for her brother pierre noticed her
satisfaction that the engagement had been broken off looking at them
pierre realized what contempt and animosity they all felt for the
rostóvs and that it was impossible in their presence even to mention
the name of her who could give up prince andrew for anyone else

at dinner the talk turned on the war the approach of which was becoming
evident prince andrew talked incessantly arguing now with his father
now with the swiss tutor dessalles and showing an unnatural animation
the cause of which pierre so well understood





chapter xxii

that same evening pierre went to the rostóvs to fulfill the commission
entrusted to him natásha was in bed the count at the club and pierre
after giving the letters to sónya went to márya dmítrievna who was
interested to know how prince andrew had taken the news ten minutes
later sónya came to márya dmítrievna

natásha insists on seeing count peter kirilovich said she

but how are we to take him up to her the room there has not been
tidied up

no she has dressed and gone into the drawing room said sónya

márya dmítrievna only shrugged her shoulders

when will her mother come she has worried me to death now mind dont
tell her everything said she to pierre one hasnt the heart to scold
her she is so much to be pitied so much to be pitied

natásha was standing in the middle of the drawing room emaciated with
a pale set face but not at all shamefaced as pierre expected to find
her when he appeared at the door she grew flurried evidently undecided
whether to go to meet him or to wait till he came up

pierre hastened to her he thought she would give him her hand as usual
but she stepping up to him stopped breathing heavily her arms
hanging lifelessly just in the pose she used to stand in when she went
to the middle of the ballroom to sing but with quite a different
expression of face

peter kirilovich she began rapidly prince bolkónski was your
friendis your friend she corrected herself it seemed to her that
everything that had once been must now be different he told me once
to apply to you

pierre sniffed as he looked at her but did not speak till then he had
reproached her in his heart and tried to despise her but he now felt so
sorry for her that there was no room in his soul for reproach

he is here now tell him to for forgive me she stopped and
breathed still more quickly but did not shed tears

yes i will tell him answered pierre but

he did not know what to say

natásha was evidently dismayed at the thought of what he might think she
had meant

no i know all is over she said hurriedly no that can never be
im only tormented by the wrong i have done him tell him only that i
beg him to forgive forgive forgive me for everything

she trembled all over and sat down on a chair

a sense of pity he had never before known overflowed pierres heart

i will tell him i will tell him everything once more said pierre
but i should like to know one thing

know what natáshas eyes asked

i should like to know did you love pierre did not know how to
refer to anatole and flushed at the thought of himdid you love that
bad man

dont call him bad said natásha but i dont know dont know at
all

she began to cry and a still greater sense of pity tenderness and love
welled up in pierre he felt the tears trickle under his spectacles and
hoped they would not be noticed

we wont speak of it any more my dear said pierre and his gentle
cordial tone suddenly seemed very strange to natásha

we wont speak of it my dearill tell him everything but one thing i
beg of you consider me your friend and if you want help advice or
simply to open your heart to someonenot now but when your mind is
clearer think of me he took her hand and kissed it i shall be happy
if its in my power

pierre grew confused

dont speak to me like that i am not worth it exclaimed natásha and
turned to leave the room but pierre held her hand

he knew he had something more to say to her but when he said it he was
amazed at his own words

stop stop you have your whole life before you said he to her

before me no all is over for me she replied with shame and self
abasement

all over he repeated if i were not myself but the handsomest
cleverest and best man in the world and were free i would this moment
ask on my knees for your hand and your love

for the first time for many days natásha wept tears of gratitude and
tenderness and glancing at pierre she went out of the room

pierre too when she had gone almost ran into the anteroom restraining
tears of tenderness and joy that choked him and without finding the
sleeves of his fur cloak threw it on and got into his sleigh

where to now your excellency asked the coachman

where to pierre asked himself where can i go now surely not to the
club or to pay calls all men seemed so pitiful so poor in comparison
with this feeling of tenderness and love he experienced in comparison
with that softened grateful last look she had given him through her
tears

home said pierre and despite twentytwo degrees of frost fahrenheit
he threw open the bearskin cloak from his broad chest and inhaled the
air with joy

it was clear and frosty above the dirty illlit streets above the
black roofs stretched the dark starry sky only looking up at the sky
did pierre cease to feel how sordid and humiliating were all mundane
things compared with the heights to which his soul had just been raised
at the entrance to the arbat square an immense expanse of dark starry
sky presented itself to his eyes almost in the center of it above the
prechistenka boulevard surrounded and sprinkled on all sides by stars
but distinguished from them all by its nearness to the earth its white
light and its long uplifted tail shone the enormous and brilliant
comet of the comet which was said to portend all kinds of woes and
the end of the world in pierre however that comet with its long
luminous tail aroused no feeling of fear on the contrary he gazed
joyfully his eyes moist with tears at this bright comet which having
traveled in its orbit with inconceivable velocity through immeasurable
space seemed suddenlylike an arrow piercing the earthto remain fixed
in a chosen spot vigorously holding its tail erect shining and
displaying its white light amid countless other scintillating stars it
seemed to pierre that this comet fully responded to what was passing in
his own softened and uplifted soul now blossoming into a new life





book nine





chapter i

from the close of the year  intensified arming and concentrating of
the forces of western europe began and in  these forcesmillions of
men reckoning those transporting and feeding the armymoved from the
west eastwards to the russian frontier toward which since  russian
forces had been similarly drawn on the twelfth of june  the
forces of western europe crossed the russian frontier and war began
that is an event took place opposed to human reason and to human
nature millions of men perpetrated against one another such innumerable
crimes frauds treacheries thefts forgeries issues of false money
burglaries incendiarisms and murders as in whole centuries are not
recorded in the annals of all the law courts of the world but which
those who committed them did not at the time regard as being crimes

what produced this extraordinary occurrence what were its causes the
historians tell us with naïve assurance that its causes were the wrongs
inflicted on the duke of oldenburg the nonobservance of the continental
system the ambition of napoleon the firmness of alexander the
mistakes of the diplomatists and so on

consequently it would only have been necessary for metternich
rumyántsev or talleyrand between a levee and an evening party to have
taken proper pains and written a more adroit note or for napoleon to
have written to alexander my respected brother i consent to restore
the duchy to the duke of oldenburgand there would have been no war

we can understand that the matter seemed like that to contemporaries it
naturally seemed to napoleon that the war was caused by englands
intrigues as in fact he said on the island of st helena it naturally
seemed to members of the english parliament that the cause of the war
was napoleons ambition to the duke of oldenburg that the cause of the
war was the violence done to him to businessmen that the cause of the
war was the continental system which was ruining europe to the generals
and old soldiers that the chief reason for the war was the necessity of
giving them employment to the legitimists of that day that it was the
need of reestablishing les bons principes and to the diplomatists of
that time that it all resulted from the fact that the alliance between
russia and austria in  had not been sufficiently well concealed from
napoleon and from the awkward wording of memorandum no  it is
natural that these and a countless and infinite quantity of other
reasons the number depending on the endless diversity of points of
view presented themselves to the men of that day but to us to
posterity who view the thing that happened in all its magnitude and
perceive its plain and terrible meaning these causes seem insufficient
to us it is incomprehensible that millions of christian men killed and
tortured each other either because napoleon was ambitious or alexander
was firm or because englands policy was astute or the duke of
oldenburg wronged we cannot grasp what connection such circumstances
have with the actual fact of slaughter and violence why because the
duke was wronged thousands of men from the other side of europe killed
and ruined the people of smolensk and moscow and were killed by them

to us their descendants who are not historians and are not carried
away by the process of research and can therefore regard the event with
unclouded common sense an incalculable number of causes present
themselves the deeper we delve in search of these causes the more of
them we find and each separate cause or whole series of causes appears
to us equally valid in itself and equally false by its insignificance
compared to the magnitude of the events and by its impotenceapart from
the cooperation of all the other coincident causesto occasion the
event to us the wish or objection of this or that french corporal to
serve a second term appears as much a cause as napoleons refusal to
withdraw his troops beyond the vistula and to restore the duchy of
oldenburg for had he not wished to serve and had a second a third
and a thousandth corporal and private also refused there would have
been so many less men in napoleons army and the war could not have
occurred

had napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw
beyond the vistula and not ordered his troops to advance there would
have been no war but had all his sergeants objected to serving a second
term then also there could have been no war nor could there have been a
war had there been no english intrigues and no duke of oldenburg and
had alexander not felt insulted and had there not been an autocratic
government in russia or a revolution in france and a subsequent
dictatorship and empire or all the things that produced the french
revolution and so on without each of these causes nothing could have
happened so all these causesmyriads of causescoincided to bring it
about and so there was no one cause for that occurrence but it had to
occur because it had to millions of men renouncing their human
feelings and reason had to go from west to east to slay their fellows
just as some centuries previously hordes of men had come from the east
to the west slaying their fellows

the actions of napoleon and alexander on whose words the event seemed
to hang were as little voluntary as the actions of any soldier who was
drawn into the campaign by lot or by conscription this could not be
otherwise for in order that the will of napoleon and alexander on whom
the event seemed to depend should be carried out the concurrence of
innumerable circumstances was needed without anyone of which the event
could not have taken place it was necessary that millions of men in
whose hands lay the real powerthe soldiers who fired or transported
provisions and gunsshould consent to carry out the will of these weak
individuals and should have been induced to do so by an infinite number
of diverse and complex causes

we are forced to fall back on fatalism as an explanation of irrational
events that is to say events the reasonableness of which we do not
understand the more we try to explain such events in history
reasonably the more unreasonable and incomprehensible do they become to
us

each man lives for himself using his freedom to attain his personal
aims and feels with his whole being that he can now do or abstain from
doing this or that action but as soon as he has done it that action
performed at a certain moment in time becomes irrevocable and belongs to
history in which it has not a free but a predestined significance

there are two sides to the life of every man his individual life which
is the more free the more abstract its interests and his elemental hive
life in which he inevitably obeys laws laid down for him

man lives consciously for himself but is an unconscious instrument in
the attainment of the historic universal aims of humanity a deed done
is irrevocable and its result coinciding in time with the actions of
millions of other men assumes an historic significance the higher a man
stands on the social ladder the more people he is connected with and
the more power he has over others the more evident is the
predestination and inevitability of his every action

the kings heart is in the hands of the lord

a king is historys slave

history that is the unconscious general hive life of mankind uses
every moment of the life of kings as a tool for its own purposes

though napoleon at that time in  was more convinced than ever that
it depended on him verser ou ne pas verser le sang de ses peuples
as alexander expressed it in the last letter he wrote himhe had never
been so much in the grip of inevitable laws which compelled him while
thinking that he was acting on his own volition to perform for the hive
lifethat is to say for historywhatever had to be performed

 to shed or not to shed the blood of his peoples

the people of the west moved eastwards to slay their fellow men and by
the law of coincidence thousands of minute causes fitted in and co
ordinated to produce that movement and war reproaches for the
nonobservance of the continental system the duke of oldenburgs wrongs
the movement of troops into prussiaundertaken as it seemed to
napoleon only for the purpose of securing an armed peace the french
emperors love and habit of war coinciding with his peoples
inclinations allurement by the grandeur of the preparations and the
expenditure on those preparations and the need of obtaining advantages
to compensate for that expenditure the intoxicating honors he received
in dresden the diplomatic negotiations which in the opinion of
contemporaries were carried on with a sincere desire to attain peace
but which only wounded the selflove of both sides and millions of
other causes that adapted themselves to the event that was happening or
coincided with it

when an apple has ripened and falls why does it fall because of its
attraction to the earth because its stalk withers because it is dried
by the sun because it grows heavier because the wind shakes it or
because the boy standing below wants to eat it

nothing is the cause all this is only the coincidence of conditions in
which all vital organic and elemental events occur and the botanist who
finds that the apple falls because the cellular tissue decays and so
forth is equally right with the child who stands under the tree and says
the apple fell because he wanted to eat it and prayed for it equally
right or wrong is he who says that napoleon went to moscow because he
wanted to and perished because alexander desired his destruction and
he who says that an undermined hill weighing a million tons fell because
the last navvy struck it for the last time with his mattock in historic
events the socalled great men are labels giving names to events and
like labels they have but the smallest connection with the event itself

every act of theirs which appears to them an act of their own will is
in an historical sense involuntary and is related to the whole course of
history and predestined from eternity





chapter ii

on the twentyninth of may napoleon left dresden where he had spent
three weeks surrounded by a court that included princes dukes kings
and even an emperor before leaving napoleon showed favor to the
emperor kings and princes who had deserved it reprimanded the kings
and princes with whom he was dissatisfied presented pearls and diamonds
of his ownthat is which he had taken from other kingsto the empress
of austria and having as his historian tells us tenderly embraced the
empress marie louisewho regarded him as her husband though he had left
another wife in parisleft her grieved by the parting which she seemed
hardly able to bear though the diplomatists still firmly believed in
the possibility of peace and worked zealously to that end and though
the emperor napoleon himself wrote a letter to alexander calling him
monsieur mon frere and sincerely assured him that he did not want war
and would always love and honor himyet he set off to join his army and
at every station gave fresh orders to accelerate the movement of his
troops from west to east he went in a traveling coach with six horses
surrounded by pages aidesdecamp and an escort along the road to
posen thorn danzig and konigsberg at each of these towns thousands
of people met him with excitement and enthusiasm

the army was moving from west to east and relays of six horses carried
him in the same direction on the tenth of june  coming up with the
army he spent the night in apartments prepared for him on the estate of
a polish count in the vilkavisski forest

 old style

next day overtaking the army he went in a carriage to the niemen and
changing into a polish uniform he drove to the riverbank in order to
select a place for the crossing

seeing on the other side some cossacks les cosaques and the wide
spreading steppes in the midst of which lay the holy city of moscow
moscou la ville sainte the capital of a realm such as the scythia
into which alexander the great had marchednapoleon unexpectedly and
contrary alike to strategic and diplomatic considerations ordered an
advance and the next day his army began to cross the niemen

early in the morning of the twelfth of june he came out of his tent
which was pitched that day on the steep left bank of the niemen and
looked through a spyglass at the streams of his troops pouring out of
the vilkavisski forest and flowing over the three bridges thrown across
the river the troops knowing of the emperors presence were on the
lookout for him and when they caught sight of a figure in an overcoat
and a cocked hat standing apart from his suite in front of his tent on
the hill they threw up their caps and shouted vive lempereur and
one after another poured in a ceaseless stream out of the vast forest
that had concealed them and separating flowed on and on by the three
bridges to the other side

now well go into action oh when he takes it in hand himself things
get hot by heaven there he is vive lempereur so these are
the steppes of asia its a nasty country all the same au revoir
beauche ill keep the best palace in moscow for you au revoir good
luck did you see the emperor vive lempereur preurif they
make me governor of india gerard ill make you minister of
kashmirthats settled vive lempereur hurrah hurrah hurrah the
cossacksthose rascalssee how they run vive lempereur there he is
do you see him ive seen him twice as i see you now the little
corporal i saw him give the cross to one of the veterans vive
lempereur came the voices of men old and young of most diverse
characters and social positions on the faces of all was one common
expression of joy at the commencement of the longexpected campaign and
of rapture and devotion to the man in the gray coat who was standing on
the hill

on the thirteenth of june a rather small thoroughbred arab horse was
brought to napoleon he mounted it and rode at a gallop to one of the
bridges over the niemen deafened continually by incessant and rapturous
acclamations which he evidently endured only because it was impossible
to forbid the soldiers to express their love of him by such shouting
but the shouting which accompanied him everywhere disturbed him and
distracted him from the military cares that had occupied him from the
time he joined the army he rode across one of the swaying pontoon
bridges to the farther side turned sharply to the left and galloped in
the direction of kovno preceded by enraptured mounted chasseurs of the
guard who breathless with delight galloped ahead to clear a path for
him through the troops on reaching the broad river viliya he stopped
near a regiment of polish uhlans stationed by the river

vivat shouted the poles ecstatically breaking their ranks and
pressing against one another to see him

napoleon looked up and down the river dismounted and sat down on a log
that lay on the bank at a mute sign from him a telescope was handed
him which he rested on the back of a happy page who had run up to him
and he gazed at the opposite bank then he became absorbed in a map laid
out on the logs without lifting his head he said something and two of
his aidesdecamp galloped off to the polish uhlans

what what did he say was heard in the ranks of the polish uhlans
when one of the aidesdecamp rode up to them

the order was to find a ford and to cross the river the colonel of the
polish uhlans a handsome old man flushed and fumbling in his speech
from excitement asked the aidedecamp whether he would be permitted to
swim the river with his uhlans instead of seeking a ford in evident
fear of refusal like a boy asking for permission to get on a horse he
begged to be allowed to swim across the river before the emperors eyes
the aidedecamp replied that probably the emperor would not be
displeased at this excess of zeal

as soon as the aidedecamp had said this the old mustached officer
with happy face and sparkling eyes raised his saber shouted vivat
and commanding the uhlans to follow him spurred his horse and galloped
into the river he gave an angry thrust to his horse which had grown
restive under him and plunged into the water heading for the deepest
part where the current was swift hundreds of uhlans galloped in after
him it was cold and uncanny in the rapid current in the middle of the
stream and the uhlans caught hold of one another as they fell off their
horses some of the horses were drowned and some of the men the others
tried to swim on some in the saddle and some clinging to their horses
manes they tried to make their way forward to the opposite bank and
though there was a ford one third of a mile away were proud that they
were swimming and drowning in this river under the eyes of the man who
sat on the log and was not even looking at what they were doing when
the aidedecamp having returned and choosing an opportune moment
ventured to draw the emperors attention to the devotion of the poles to
his person the little man in the gray overcoat got up and having
summoned berthier began pacing up and down the bank with him giving
him instructions and occasionally glancing disapprovingly at the
drowning uhlans who distracted his attention

for him it was no new conviction that his presence in any part of the
world from africa to the steppes of muscovy alike was enough to
dumfound people and impel them to insane selfoblivion he called for
his horse and rode to his quarters

some forty uhlans were drowned in the river though boats were sent to
their assistance the majority struggled back to the bank from which
they had started the colonel and some of his men got across and with
difficulty clambered out on the further bank and as soon as they had
got out in their soaked and streaming clothes they shouted vivat
and looked ecstatically at the spot where napoleon had been but where he
no longer was and at that moment considered themselves happy

that evening between issuing one order that the forged russian paper
money prepared for use in russia should be delivered as quickly as
possible and another that a saxon should be shot on whom a letter
containing information about the orders to the french army had been
found napoleon also gave instructions that the polish colonel who had
needlessly plunged into the river should be enrolled in the legion
dhonneur of which napoleon was himself the head

quos vult perdere dementat

 those whom god wishes to destroy he drives mad





chapter iii

the emperor of russia had meanwhile been in vilna for more than a
month reviewing troops and holding maneuvers nothing was ready for the
war that everyone expected and to prepare for which the emperor had come
from petersburg there was no general plan of action the vacillation
between the various plans that were proposed had even increased after
the emperor had been at headquarters for a month each of the three
armies had its own commanderinchief but there was no supreme
commander of all the forces and the emperor did not assume that
responsibility himself

the longer the emperor remained in vilna the less did everybodytired of
waitingprepare for the war all the efforts of those who surrounded the
sovereign seemed directed merely to making him spend his time pleasantly
and forget that war was impending

in june after many balls and fetes given by the polish magnates by the
courtiers and by the emperor himself it occurred to one of the polish
aidesdecamp in attendance that a dinner and ball should be given for
the emperor by his aidesdecamp this idea was eagerly received the
emperor gave his consent the aidesdecamp collected money by
subscription the lady who was thought to be most pleasing to the
emperor was invited to act as hostess count bennigsen being a
landowner in the vilna province offered his country house for the fete
and the thirteenth of june was fixed for a ball dinner regatta and
fireworks at zakret count bennigsens country seat

the very day that napoleon issued the order to cross the niemen and his
vanguard driving off the cossacks crossed the russian frontier
alexander spent the evening at the entertainment given by his aidesde
camp at bennigsens country house

it was a gay and brilliant fete connoisseurs of such matters declared
that rarely had so many beautiful women been assembled in one place
countess bezúkhova was present among other russian ladies who had
followed the sovereign from petersburg to vilna and eclipsed the refined
polish ladies by her massive socalled russian type of beauty the
emperor noticed her and honored her with a dance

borís drubetskóy having left his wife in moscow and being for the
present en garcon as he phrased it was also there and though not an
aidedecamp had subscribed a large sum toward the expenses borís was
now a rich man who had risen to high honors and no longer sought
patronage but stood on an equal footing with the highest of those of his
own age he was meeting hélène in vilna after not having seen her for a
long time and did not recall the past but as hélène was enjoying the
favors of a very important personage and borís had only recently
married they met as good friends of long standing

at midnight dancing was still going on hélène not having a suitable
partner herself offered to dance the mazurka with borís they were the
third couple borís coolly looking at hélènes dazzling bare shoulders
which emerged from a dark goldembroidered gauze gown talked to her
of old acquaintances and at the same time unaware of it himself and
unnoticed by others never for an instant ceased to observe the emperor
who was in the same room the emperor was not dancing he stood in the
doorway stopping now one pair and now another with gracious words which
he alone knew how to utter

as the mazurka began borís saw that adjutant general balashev one of
those in closest attendance on the emperor went up to him and contrary
to court etiquette stood near him while he was talking to a polish lady
having finished speaking to her the emperor looked inquiringly at
balashev and evidently understanding that he only acted thus because
there were important reasons for so doing nodded slightly to the lady
and turned to him hardly had balashev begun to speak before a look of
amazement appeared on the emperors face he took balashev by the arm
and crossed the room with him unconsciously clearing a path seven yards
wide as the people on both sides made way for him borís noticed
arakcheevs excited face when the sovereign went out with balashev
arakcheev looked at the emperor from under his brow and sniffing with
his red nose stepped forward from the crowd as if expecting the emperor
to address him borís understood that arakcheev envied balashev and was
displeased that evidently important news had reached the emperor
otherwise than through himself

but the emperor and balashev passed out into the illuminated garden
without noticing arakcheev who holding his sword and glancing
wrathfully around followed some twenty paces behind them

all the time borís was going through the figures of the mazurka he was
worried by the question of what news balashev had brought and how he
could find it out before others in the figure in which he had to choose
two ladies he whispered to hélène that he meant to choose countess
potocka who he thought had gone out onto the veranda and glided over
the parquet to the door opening into the garden where seeing balashev
and the emperor returning to the veranda he stood still they were
moving toward the door borís fluttering as if he had not had time to
withdraw respectfully pressed close to the doorpost with bowed head

the emperor with the agitation of one who has been personally
affronted was finishing with these words

to enter russia without declaring war i will not make peace as long as
a single armed enemy remains in my country it seemed to borís that it
gave the emperor pleasure to utter these words he was satisfied with
the form in which he had expressed his thoughts but displeased that
borís had overheard it

let no one know of it the emperor added with a frown

borís understood that this was meant for him and closing his eyes
slightly bowed his head the emperor reentered the ballroom and
remained there about another halfhour

borís was thus the first to learn the news that the french army had
crossed the niemen and thanks to this was able to show certain
important personages that much that was concealed from others was
usually known to him and by this means he rose higher in their
estimation

the unexpected news of the french having crossed the niemen was
particularly startling after a month of unfulfilled expectations and at
a ball on first receiving the news under the influence of indignation
and resentment the emperor had found a phrase that pleased him fully
expressed his feelings and has since become famous on returning home
at two oclock that night he sent for his secretary shishkov and told
him to write an order to the troops and a rescript to field marshal
prince saltykov in which he insisted on the words being inserted that
he would not make peace so long as a single armed frenchman remained on
russian soil

next day the following letter was sent to napoleon

monsieur mon frere

yesterday i learned that despite the loyalty with which i have kept my
engagements with your majesty your troops have crossed the russian
frontier and i have this moment received from petersburg a note in
which count lauriston informs me as a reason for this aggression that
your majesty has considered yourself to be in a state of war with me
from the time prince kurágin asked for his passports the reasons on
which the duc de bassano based his refusal to deliver them to him would
never have led me to suppose that that could serve as a pretext for
aggression in fact the ambassador as he himself has declared was
never authorized to make that demand and as soon as i was informed of
it i let him know how much i disapproved of it and ordered him to remain
at his post if your majesty does not intend to shed the blood of our
peoples for such a misunderstanding and consents to withdraw your
troops from russian territory i will regard what has passed as not
having occurred and an understanding between us will be possible in the
contrary case your majesty i shall see myself forced to repel an
attack that nothing on my part has provoked it still depends on your
majesty to preserve humanity from the calamity of another war i am
etc

signed alexander





chapter iv

at two in the morning of the fourteenth of june the emperor having
sent for balashev and read him his letter to napoleon ordered him to
take it and hand it personally to the french emperor when dispatching
balashev the emperor repeated to him the words that he would not make
peace so long as a single armed enemy remained on russian soil and told
him to transmit those words to napoleon alexander did not insert them
in his letter to napoleon because with his characteristic tact he felt
it would be injudicious to use them at a moment when a last attempt at
reconciliation was being made but he definitely instructed balashev to
repeat them personally to napoleon

having set off in the small hours of the fourteenth accompanied by a
bugler and two cossacks balashev reached the french outposts at the
village of rykonty on the russian side of the niemen by dawn there he
was stopped by french cavalry sentinels

a french noncommissioned officer of hussars in crimson uniform and a
shaggy cap shouted to the approaching balashev to halt balashev did
not do so at once but continued to advance along the road at a walking
pace

the noncommissioned officer frowned and muttering words of abuse
advanced his horses chest against balashev put his hand to his saber
and shouted rudely at the russian general asking was he deaf that he
did not do as he was told balashev mentioned who he was the
noncommissioned officer began talking with his comrades about regimental
matters without looking at the russian general

after living at the seat of the highest authority and power after
conversing with the emperor less than three hours before and in general
being accustomed to the respect due to his rank in the service balashev
found it very strange here on russian soil to encounter this hostile
and still more this disrespectful application of brute force to
himself

the sun was only just appearing from behind the clouds the air was
fresh and dewy a herd of cattle was being driven along the road from
the village and over the fields the larks rose trilling one after
another like bubbles rising in water

balashev looked around him awaiting the arrival of an officer from the
village the russian cossacks and bugler and the french hussars looked
silently at one another from time to time

a french colonel of hussars who had evidently just left his bed came
riding from the village on a handsome sleek gray horse accompanied by
two hussars the officer the soldiers and their horses all looked
smart and well kept

it was that first period of a campaign when troops are still in full
trim almost like that of peacetime maneuvers but with a shade of
martial swagger in their clothes and a touch of the gaiety and spirit
of enterprise which always accompany the opening of a campaign

the french colonel with difficulty repressed a yawn but was polite and
evidently understood balashevs importance he led him past his soldiers
and behind the outposts and told him that his wish to be presented to
the emperor would most likely be satisfied immediately as the emperors
quarters were he believed not far off

they rode through the village of rykonty past tethered french hussar
horses past sentinels and men who saluted their colonel and stared with
curiosity at a russian uniform and came out at the other end of the
village the colonel said that the commander of the division was a mile
and a quarter away and would receive balashev and conduct him to his
destination

the sun had by now risen and shone gaily on the bright verdure

they had hardly ridden up a hill past a tavern before they saw a group
of horsemen coming toward them in front of the group on a black horse
with trappings that glittered in the sun rode a tall man with plumes in
his hat and black hair curling down to his shoulders he wore a red
mantle and stretched his long legs forward in french fashion this man
rode toward balashev at a gallop his plumes flowing and his gems and
gold lace glittering in the bright june sunshine

balashev was only two horses length from the equestrian with the
bracelets plumes necklaces and gold embroidery who was galloping
toward him with a theatrically solemn countenance when julner the
french colonel whispered respectfully the king of naples it was in
fact murat now called king of naples though it was quite
incomprehensible why he should be king of naples he was called so and
was himself convinced that he was so and therefore assumed a more
solemn and important air than formerly he was so sure that he really
was the king of naples that when on the eve of his departure from that
city while walking through the streets with his wife some italians
called out to him viva il re  he turned to his wife with a pensive
smile and said poor fellows they dont know that i am leaving them
tomorrow

 long live the king

but though he firmly believed himself to be king of naples and pitied
the grief felt by the subjects he was abandoning latterly after he had
been ordered to return to military serviceand especially since his last
interview with napoleon in danzig when his august brotherinlaw had
told him i made you king that you should reign in my way but not in
yourshe had cheerfully taken up his familiar business andlike a
wellfed but not overfat horse that feels himself in harness and grows
skittish between the shaftshe dressed up in clothes as variegated and
expensive as possible and gaily and contentedly galloped along the
roads of poland without himself knowing why or whither

on seeing the russian general he threw back his head with its long hair
curling to his shoulders in a majestically royal manner and looked
inquiringly at the french colonel the colonel respectfully informed his
majesty of balashevs mission whose name he could not pronounce

de balmacheve said the king overcoming by his assurance the
difficulty that had presented itself to the colonel charmed to make
your acquaintance general he added with a gesture of kingly
condescension

as soon as the king began to speak loud and fast his royal dignity
instantly forsook him and without noticing it he passed into his
natural tone of goodnatured familiarity he laid his hand on the
withers of balashevs horse and said

well general it all looks like war as if regretting a circumstance
of which he was unable to judge

your majesty replied balashev my master the emperor does not
desire war and as your majesty sees said balashev using the words
your majesty at every opportunity with the affectation unavoidable in
frequently addressing one to whom the title was still a novelty

murats face beamed with stupid satisfaction as he listened to monsieur
de balmacheve but royaute oblige  and he felt it incumbent on him
as a king and an ally to confer on state affairs with alexanders
envoy he dismounted took balashevs arm and moving a few steps away
from his suite which waited respectfully began to pace up and down
with him trying to speak significantly he referred to the fact that
the emperor napoleon had resented the demand that he should withdraw his
troops from prussia especially when that demand became generally known
and the dignity of france was thereby offended

 royalty has its obligations

balashev replied that there was nothing offensive in the demand
because but murat interrupted him

then you dont consider the emperor alexander the aggressor he asked
unexpectedly with a kindly and foolish smile

balashev told him why he considered napoleon to be the originator of the
war

oh my dear general murat again interrupted him with all my heart i
wish the emperors may arrange the affair between them and that the war
begun by no wish of mine may finish as quickly as possible said he in
the tone of a servant who wants to remain good friends with another
despite a quarrel between their masters

and he went on to inquiries about the grand duke and the state of his
health and to reminiscences of the gay and amusing times he had spent
with him in naples then suddenly as if remembering his royal dignity
murat solemnly drew himself up assumed the pose in which he had stood
at his coronation and waving his right arm said

i wont detain you longer general i wish success to your mission
and with his embroidered red mantle his flowing feathers and his
glittering ornaments he rejoined his suite who were respectfully
awaiting him

balashev rode on supposing from murats words that he would very soon
be brought before napoleon himself but instead of that at the next
village the sentinels of davouts infantry corps detained him as the
pickets of the vanguard had done and an adjutant of the corps
commander who was fetched conducted him into the village to marshal
davout





chapter v

davout was to napoleon what arakcheev was to alexanderthough not a
coward like arakcheev he was as precise as cruel and as unable to
express his devotion to his monarch except by cruelty

in the organism of states such men are necessary as wolves are
necessary in the organism of nature and they always exist always
appear and hold their own however incongruous their presence and their
proximity to the head of the government may be this inevitability alone
can explain how the cruel arakcheev who tore out a grenadiers mustache
with his own hands whose weak nerves rendered him unable to face
danger and who was neither an educated man nor a courtier was able to
maintain his powerful position with alexander whose own character was
chivalrous noble and gentle

balashev found davout seated on a barrel in the shed of a peasants hut
writinghe was auditing accounts better quarters could have been found
him but marshal davout was one of those men who purposely put
themselves in most depressing conditions to have a justification for
being gloomy for the same reason they are always hard at work and in a
hurry how can i think of the bright side of life when as you see i
am sitting on a barrel and working in a dirty shed the expression of
his face seemed to say the chief pleasure and necessity of such men
when they encounter anyone who shows animation is to flaunt their own
dreary persistent activity davout allowed himself that pleasure when
balashev was brought in he became still more absorbed in his task when
the russian general entered and after glancing over his spectacles at
balashevs face which was animated by the beauty of the morning and by
his talk with murat he did not rise or even stir but scowled still
more and sneered malevolently

when he noticed in balashevs face the disagreeable impression this
reception produced davout raised his head and coldly asked what he
wanted

thinking he could have been received in such a manner only because
davout did not know that he was adjutant general to the emperor
alexander and even his envoy to napoleon balashev hastened to inform
him of his rank and mission contrary to his expectation davout after
hearing him became still surlier and ruder

where is your dispatch he inquired give it to me i will send it to
the emperor

balashev replied that he had been ordered to hand it personally to the
emperor

your emperors orders are obeyed in your army but here said davout
you must do as youre told

and as if to make the russian general still more conscious of his
dependence on brute force davout sent an adjutant to call the officer
on duty

balashev took out the packet containing the emperors letter and laid it
on the table made of a door with its hinges still hanging on it laid
across two barrels davout took the packet and read the inscription

you are perfectly at liberty to treat me with respect or not
protested balashev but permit me to observe that i have the honor to
be adjutant general to his majesty

davout glanced at him silently and plainly derived pleasure from the
signs of agitation and confusion which appeared on balashevs face

you will be treated as is fitting said he and putting the packet in
his pocket left the shed

a minute later the marshals adjutant de castres came in and conducted
balashev to the quarters assigned him

that day he dined with the marshal at the same board on the barrels

next day davout rode out early and after asking balashev to come to
him peremptorily requested him to remain there to move on with the
baggage train should orders come for it to move and to talk to no one
except monsieur de castres

after four days of solitude ennui and consciousness of his impotence
and insignificanceparticularly acute by contrast with the sphere of
power in which he had so lately movedand after several marches with the
marshals baggage and the french army which occupied the whole
district balashev was brought to vilnanow occupied by the
frenchthrough the very gate by which he had left it four days
previously

next day the imperial gentlemaninwaiting the comte de turenne came
to balashev and informed him of the emperor napoleons wish to honor him
with an audience

four days before sentinels of the preobrazhensk regiment had stood in
front of the house to which balashev was conducted and now two french
grenadiers stood there in blue uniforms unfastened in front and with
shaggy caps on their heads and an escort of hussars and uhlans and a
brilliant suite of aidesdecamp pages and generals who were waiting
for napoleon to come out were standing at the porch round his saddle
horse and his mameluke rustan napoleon received balashev in the very
house in vilna from which alexander had dispatched him on his mission





chapter vi

though balashev was used to imperial pomp he was amazed at the luxury
and magnificence of napoleons court

the comte de turenne showed him into a big reception room where many
generals gentlemeninwaiting and polish magnatesseveral of whom
balashev had seen at the court of the emperor of russiawere waiting
duroc said that napoleon would receive the russian general before going
for his ride

after some minutes the gentlemaninwaiting who was on duty came into
the great reception room and bowing politely asked balashev to follow
him

balashev went into a small reception room one door of which led into a
study the very one from which the russian emperor had dispatched him on
his mission he stood a minute or two waiting he heard hurried
footsteps beyond the door both halves of it were opened rapidly all
was silent and then from the study the sound was heard of other steps
firm and resolutethey were those of napoleon he had just finished
dressing for his ride and wore a blue uniform opening in front over a
white waistcoat so long that it covered his rotund stomach white
leather breeches tightly fitting the fat thighs of his short legs and
hessian boots his short hair had evidently just been brushed but one
lock hung down in the middle of his broad forehead his plump white neck
stood out sharply above the black collar of his uniform and he smelled
of eau de cologne his full face rather younglooking with its
prominent chin wore a gracious and majestic expression of imperial
welcome

he entered briskly with a jerk at every step and his head slightly
thrown back his whole short corpulent figure with broad thick
shoulders and chest and stomach involuntarily protruding had that
imposing and stately appearance one sees in men of forty who live in
comfort it was evident too that he was in the best of spirits that
day

he nodded in answer to balashavs low and respectful bow and coming up
to him at once began speaking like a man who values every moment of his
time and does not condescend to prepare what he has to say but is sure
he will always say the right thing and say it well

good day general said he i have received the letter you brought
from the emperor alexander and am very glad to see you he glanced with
his large eyes into balashavs face and immediately looked past him

it was plain that balashevs personality did not interest him at all
evidently only what took place within his own mind interested him
nothing outside himself had any significance for him because everything
in the world it seemed to him depended entirely on his will

i do not and did not desire war he continued but it has been
forced on me even now he emphasized the word i am ready to receive
any explanations you can give me

and he began clearly and concisely to explain his reasons for
dissatisfaction with the russian government judging by the calmly
moderate and amicable tone in which the french emperor spoke balashev
was firmly persuaded that he wished for peace and intended to enter into
negotiations

when napoleon having finished speaking looked inquiringly at the
russian envoy balashev began a speech he had prepared long before
sire the emperor my master but the sight of the emperors eyes
bent on him confused him you are flurriedcompose yourself napoleon
seemed to say as with a scarcely perceptible smile he looked at
balashevs uniform and sword

balashev recovered himself and began to speak he said that the emperor
alexander did not consider kurakins demand for his passports a
sufficient cause for war that kurakin had acted on his own initiative
and without his sovereigns assent that the emperor alexander did not
desire war and had no relations with england

not yet interposed napoleon and as if fearing to give vent to his
feelings he frowned and nodded slightly as a sign that balashev might
proceed

after saying all he had been instructed to say balashev added that the
emperor alexander wished for peace but would not enter into
negotiations except on condition that here balashev hesitated he
remembered the words the emperor alexander had not written in his
letter but had specially inserted in the rescript to saltykov and had
told balashev to repeat to napoleon balashev remembered these words
so long as a single armed foe remains on russian soil but some
complex feeling restrained him he could not utter them though he
wished to do so he grew confused and said on condition that the
french army retires beyond the niemen

napoleon noticed balashevs embarrassment when uttering these last
words his face twitched and the calf of his left leg began to quiver
rhythmically without moving from where he stood he began speaking in a
louder tone and more hurriedly than before during the speech that
followed balashev who more than once lowered his eyes involuntarily
noticed the quivering of napoleons left leg which increased the more
napoleon raised his voice

i desire peace no less than the emperor alexander he began have i
not for eighteen months been doing everything to obtain it i have
waited eighteen months for explanations but in order to begin
negotiations what is demanded of me he said frowning and making an
energetic gesture of inquiry with his small white plump hand

the withdrawal of your army beyond the niemen sire replied balashev

the niemen repeated napoleon so now you want me to retire beyond
the niemenonly the niemen repeated napoleon looking straight at
balashev

the latter bowed his head respectfully

instead of the demand of four months earlier to withdraw from pomerania
only a withdrawal beyond the niemen was now demanded napoleon turned
quickly and began to pace the room

you say the demand now is that i am to withdraw beyond the niemen
before commencing negotiations but in just the same way two months ago
the demand was that i should withdraw beyond the vistula and the oder
and yet you are willing to negotiate

he went in silence from one corner of the room to the other and again
stopped in front of balashev balashev noticed that his left leg was
quivering faster than before and his face seemed petrified in its stern
expression this quivering of his left leg was a thing napoleon was
conscious of the vibration of my left calf is a great sign with me
he remarked at a later date

such demands as to retreat beyond the vistula and oder may be made to a
prince of baden but not to me napoleon almost screamed quite to his
own surprise if you gave me petersburg and moscow i could not accept
such conditions you say i have begun this war but who first joined his
army the emperor alexander not i and you offer me negotiations when i
have expended millions when you are in alliance with england and when
your position is a bad one you offer me negotiations but what is the
aim of your alliance with england what has she given you he continued
hurriedly evidently no longer trying to show the advantages of peace
and discuss its possibility but only to prove his own rectitude and
power and alexanders errors and duplicity

the commencement of his speech had obviously been made with the
intention of demonstrating the advantages of his position and showing
that he was nevertheless willing to negotiate but he had begun talking
and the more he talked the less could he control his words

the whole purport of his remarks now was evidently to exalt himself and
insult alexanderjust what he had least desired at the commencement of
the interview

i hear you have made peace with turkey

balashev bowed his head affirmatively

peace has been concluded he began

but napoleon did not let him speak he evidently wanted to do all the
talking himself and continued to talk with the sort of eloquence and
unrestrained irritability to which spoiled people are so prone

yes i know you have made peace with the turks without obtaining
moldavia and wallachia i would have given your sovereign those
provinces as i gave him finland yes he went on i promised and would
have given the emperor alexander moldavia and wallachia and now he
wont have those splendid provinces yet he might have united them to
his empire and in a single reign would have extended russia from the
gulf of bothnia to the mouths of the danube catherine the great could
not have done more said napoleon growing more and more excited as he
paced up and down the room repeating to balashev almost the very words
he had used to alexander himself at tilsit all that he would have
owed to my friendship oh what a splendid reign he repeated several
times then paused drew from his pocket a gold snuffbox lifted it to
his nose and greedily sniffed at it

what a splendid reign the emperor alexanders might have been

he looked compassionately at balashev and as soon as the latter tried
to make some rejoinder hastily interrupted him

what could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained through
my friendship demanded napoleon shrugging his shoulders in
perplexity but no he has preferred to surround himself with my
enemies and with whom with steins armfeldts bennigsens and
wintzingerodes stein a traitor expelled from his own country
armfeldt a rake and an intriguer wintzingerode a fugitive french
subject bennigsen rather more of a soldier than the others but all
the same an incompetent who was unable to do anything in  and who
should awaken terrible memories in the emperor alexanders mind
granted that were they competent they might be made use of continued
napoleonhardly able to keep pace in words with the rush of thoughts
that incessantly sprang up proving how right and strong he was in his
perception the two were one and the samebut they are not even that
they are neither fit for war nor peace barclay is said to be the most
capable of them all but i cannot say so judging by his first
movements and what are they doing all these courtiers pfuel proposes
armfeldt disputes bennigsen considers and barclay called on to act
does not know what to decide on and time passes bringing no result
bagration alone is a military man hes stupid but he has experience a
quick eye and resolution and what role is your young monarch
playing in that monstrous crowd they compromise him and throw on him
the responsibility for all that happens a sovereign should not be with
the army unless he is a general said napoleon evidently uttering
these words as a direct challenge to the emperor he knew how alexander
desired to be a military commander

the campaign began only a week ago and you havent even been able to
defend vilna you are cut in two and have been driven out of the polish
provinces your army is grumbling

on the contrary your majesty said balashev hardly able to remember
what had been said to him and following these verbal fireworks with
difficulty the troops are burning with eagerness

i know everything napoleon interrupted him i know everything i
know the number of your battalions as exactly as i know my own you have
not two hundred thousand men and i have three times that number i give
you my word of honor said napoleon forgetting that his word of honor
could carry no weighti give you my word of honor that i have five
hundred and thirty thousand men this side of the vistula the turks will
be of no use to you they are worth nothing and have shown it by making
peace with you as for the swedesit is their fate to be governed by mad
kings their king was insane and they changed him for
anotherbernadotte who promptly went madfor no swede would ally
himself with russia unless he were mad

napoleon grinned maliciously and again raised his snuffbox to his nose

balashev knew how to reply to each of napoleons remarks and would have
done so he continually made the gesture of a man wishing to say
something but napoleon always interrupted him to the alleged insanity
of the swedes balashev wished to reply that when russia is on her side
sweden is practically an island but napoleon gave an angry exclamation
to drown his voice napoleon was in that state of irritability in which
a man has to talk talk and talk merely to convince himself that he is
in the right balashev began to feel uncomfortable as envoy he feared
to demean his dignity and felt the necessity of replying but as a man
he shrank before the transport of groundless wrath that had evidently
seized napoleon he knew that none of the words now uttered by napoleon
had any significance and that napoleon himself would be ashamed of them
when he came to his senses balashev stood with downcast eyes looking
at the movements of napoleons stout legs and trying to avoid meeting
his eyes

but what do i care about your allies said napoleon i have
alliesthe poles there are eighty thousand of them and they fight like
lions and there will be two hundred thousand of them

and probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had uttered this
obvious falsehood and that balashev still stood silently before him in
the same attitude of submission to fate napoleon abruptly turned round
drew close to balashevs face and gesticulating rapidly and
energetically with his white hands almost shouted

know that if you stir up prussia against me ill wipe it off the map
of europe he declared his face pale and distorted by anger and he
struck one of his small hands energetically with the other yes i will
throw you back beyond the dvina and beyond the dnieper and will re
erect against you that barrier which it was criminal and blind of europe
to allow to be destroyed yes that is what will happen to you that is
what you have gained by alienating me and he walked silently several
times up and down the room his fat shoulders twitching

he put his snuffbox into his waistcoat pocket took it out again lifted
it several times to his nose and stopped in front of balashev he
paused looked ironically straight into balashevs eyes and said in a
quiet voice

and yet what a splendid reign your master might have had

balashev feeling it incumbent on him to reply said that from the
russian side things did not appear in so gloomy a light napoleon was
silent still looking derisively at him and evidently not listening to
him balashev said that in russia the best results were expected from
the war napoleon nodded condescendingly as if to say i know its
your duty to say that but you dont believe it yourself i have
convinced you

when balashev had ended napoleon again took out his snuffbox sniffed
at it and stamped his foot twice on the floor as a signal the door
opened a gentlemaninwaiting bending respectfully handed the emperor
his hat and gloves another brought him a pocket handkerchief napoleon
without giving them a glance turned to balashev

assure the emperor alexander from me said he taking his hat that i
am as devoted to him as before i know him thoroughly and very highly
esteem his lofty qualities i will detain you no longer general you
shall receive my letter to the emperor

and napoleon went quickly to the door everyone in the reception room
rushed forward and descended the staircase





chapter vii

after all that napoleon had said to himthose bursts of anger and the
last dryly spoken words i will detain you no longer general you
shall receive my letter balashev felt convinced that napoleon would
not wish to see him and would even avoid another meeting with himan
insulted envoyespecially as he had witnessed his unseemly anger but
to his surprise balashev received through duroc an invitation to dine
with the emperor that day

bessieres caulaincourt and berthier were present at that dinner

napoleon met balashev cheerfully and amiably he not only showed no sign
of constraint or selfreproach on account of his outburst that morning
but on the contrary tried to reassure balashev it was evident that he
had long been convinced that it was impossible for him to make a
mistake and that in his perception whatever he did was right not
because it harmonized with any idea of right and wrong but because he
did it

the emperor was in very good spirits after his ride through vilna where
crowds of people had rapturously greeted and followed him from all the
windows of the streets through which he rode rugs flags and his
monogram were displayed and the polish ladies welcoming him waved
their handkerchiefs to him

at dinner having placed balashev beside him napoleon not only treated
him amiably but behaved as if balashev were one of his own courtiers
one of those who sympathized with his plans and ought to rejoice at his
success in the course of conversation he mentioned moscow and
questioned balashev about the russian capital not merely as an
interested traveler asks about a new city he intends to visit but as if
convinced that balashev as a russian must be flattered by his
curiosity

how many inhabitants are there in moscow how many houses is it true
that moscow is called holy moscow how many churches are there in
moscow he asked

and receiving the reply that there were more than two hundred churches
he remarked

why such a quantity of churches

the russians are very devout replied balashev

but a large number of monasteries and churches is always a sign of the
backwardness of a people said napoleon turning to caulaincourt for
appreciation of this remark

balashev respectfully ventured to disagree with the french emperor

every country has its own character said he

but nowhere in europe is there anything like that said napoleon

i beg your majestys pardon returned balashev besides russia there
is spain where there are also many churches and monasteries

this reply of balashevs which hinted at the recent defeats of the
french in spain was much appreciated when he related it at alexanders
court but it was not much appreciated at napoleons dinner where it
passed unnoticed

the uninterested and perplexed faces of the marshals showed that they
were puzzled as to what balashevs tone suggested if there is a point
we dont see it or it is not at all witty their expressions seemed to
say so little was his rejoinder appreciated that napoleon did not
notice it at all and naïvely asked balashev through what towns the
direct road from there to moscow passed balashev who was on the alert
all through the dinner replied that just as all roads lead to rome
so all roads lead to moscow there were many roads and among them the
road through poltava which charles xii chose balashev involuntarily
flushed with pleasure at the aptitude of this reply but hardly had he
uttered the word poltava before caulaincourt began speaking of the
badness of the road from petersburg to moscow and of his petersburg
reminiscences

after dinner they went to drink coffee in napoleons study which four
days previously had been that of the emperor alexander napoleon sat
down toying with his sevres coffee cup and motioned balashev to a
chair beside him

napoleon was in that wellknown afterdinner mood which more than any
reasoned cause makes a man contented with himself and disposed to
consider everyone his friend it seemed to him that he was surrounded by
men who adored him and he felt convinced that after his dinner
balashev too was his friend and worshiper napoleon turned to him with a
pleasant though slightly ironic smile

they tell me this is the room the emperor alexander occupied strange
isnt it general he said evidently not doubting that this remark
would be agreeable to his hearer since it went to prove his napoleons
superiority to alexander

balashev made no reply and bowed his head in silence

yes four days ago in this room wintzingerode and stein were
deliberating continued napoleon with the same derisive and self
confident smile what i cant understand he went on is that the
emperor alexander has surrounded himself with my personal enemies that
i do not understand has he not thought that i may do the same and
he turned inquiringly to balashev and evidently this thought turned him
back on to the track of his mornings anger which was still fresh in
him

and let him know that i will do so said napoleon rising and pushing
his cup away with his hand ill drive all his wurttemberg baden and
weimar relations out of germany yes ill drive them out let him
prepare an asylum for them in russia

balashev bowed his head with an air indicating that he would like to
make his bow and leave and only listened because he could not help
hearing what was said to him napoleon did not notice this expression
he treated balashev not as an envoy from his enemy but as a man now
fully devoted to him and who must rejoice at his former masters
humiliation

and why has the emperor alexander taken command of the armies what is
the good of that war is my profession but his business is to reign and
not to command armies why has he taken on himself such a
responsibility

again napoleon brought out his snuffbox paced several times up and down
the room in silence and then suddenly and unexpectedly went up to
balashev and with a slight smile as confidently quickly and simply as
if he were doing something not merely important but pleasing to
balashev he raised his hand to the fortyyearold russian generals
face and taking him by the ear pulled it gently smiling with his lips
only

to have ones ear pulled by the emperor was considered the greatest
honor and mark of favor at the french court

well adorer and courtier of the emperor alexander why dont you say
anything said he as if it was ridiculous in his presence to be the
adorer and courtier of anyone but himself napoleon are the horses
ready for the general he added with a slight inclination of his head
in reply to balashevs bow let him have mine he has a long way to
go

the letter taken by balashev was the last napoleon sent to alexander
every detail of the interview was communicated to the russian monarch
and the war began





chapter viii

after his interview with pierre in moscow prince andrew went to
petersburg on business as he told his family but really to meet
anatole kurágin whom he felt it necessary to encounter on reaching
petersburg he inquired for kurágin but the latter had already left the
city pierre had warned his brotherinlaw that prince andrew was on his
track anatole kurágin promptly obtained an appointment from the
minister of war and went to join the army in moldavia while in
petersburg prince andrew met kutúzov his former commander who was
always well disposed toward him and kutúzov suggested that he should
accompany him to the army in moldavia to which the old general had been
appointed commanderinchief so prince andrew having received an
appointment on the headquarters staff left for turkey

prince andrew did not think it proper to write and challenge kurágin he
thought that if he challenged him without some fresh cause it might
compromise the young countess rostóva and so he wanted to meet kurágin
personally in order to find a fresh pretext for a duel but he again
failed to meet kurágin in turkey for soon after prince andrew arrived
the latter returned to russia in a new country amid new conditions
prince andrew found life easier to bear after his betrothed had broken
faith with himwhich he felt the more acutely the more he tried to
conceal its effectsthe surroundings in which he had been happy became
trying to him and the freedom and independence he had once prized so
highly were still more so not only could he no longer think the
thoughts that had first come to him as he lay gazing at the sky on the
field of austerlitz and had later enlarged upon with pierre and which
had filled his solitude at bogucharovo and then in switzerland and rome
but he even dreaded to recall them and the bright and boundless horizons
they had revealed he was now concerned only with the nearest practical
matters unrelated to his past interests and he seized on these the more
eagerly the more those past interests were closed to him it was as if
that lofty infinite canopy of heaven that had once towered above him
had suddenly turned into a low solid vault that weighed him down in
which all was clear but nothing eternal or mysterious

of the activities that presented themselves to him army service was the
simplest and most familiar as a general on duty on kutúzovs staff he
applied himself to business with zeal and perseverance and surprised
kutúzov by his willingness and accuracy in work not having found
kurágin in turkey prince andrew did not think it necessary to rush back
to russia after him but all the same he knew that however long it might
be before he met kurágin despite his contempt for him and despite all
the proofs he deduced to convince himself that it was not worth stooping
to a conflict with himhe knew that when he did meet him he would not be
able to resist calling him out any more than a ravenous man can help
snatching at food and the consciousness that the insult was not yet
avenged that his rancor was still unspent weighed on his heart and
poisoned the artificial tranquillity which he managed to obtain in
turkey by means of restless plodding and rather vainglorious and
ambitious activity

in the year  when news of the war with napoleon reached
bucharestwhere kutúzov had been living for two months passing his days
and nights with a wallachian womanprince andrew asked kutúzov to
transfer him to the western army kutúzov who was already weary of
bolkónskis activity which seemed to reproach his own idleness very
readily let him go and gave him a mission to barclay de tolly

before joining the western army which was then in may encamped at
drissa prince andrew visited bald hills which was directly on his way
being only two miles off the smolensk highroad during the last three
years there had been so many changes in his life he had thought felt
and seen so much having traveled both in the east and the west that
on reaching bald hills it struck him as strange and unexpected to find
the way of life there unchanged and still the same in every detail he
entered through the gates with their stone pillars and drove up the
avenue leading to the house as if he were entering an enchanted
sleeping castle the same old stateliness the same cleanliness the
same stillness reigned there and inside there was the same furniture
the same walls sounds and smell and the same timid faces only
somewhat older princess mary was still the same timid plain maiden
getting on in years uselessly and joylessly passing the best years of
her life in fear and constant suffering mademoiselle bourienne was the
same coquettish selfsatisfied girl enjoying every moment of her
existence and full of joyous hopes for the future she had merely become
more selfconfident prince andrew thought dessalles the tutor he had
brought from switzerland was wearing a coat of russian cut and talking
broken russian to the servants but was still the same narrowly
intelligent conscientious and pedantic preceptor the old prince had
changed in appearance only by the loss of a tooth which left a
noticeable gap on one side of his mouth in character he was the same as
ever only showing still more irritability and skepticism as to what was
happening in the world little nicholas alone had changed he had grown
become rosier had curly dark hair and when merry and laughing quite
unconsciously lifted the upper lip of his pretty little mouth just as
the little princess used to do he alone did not obey the law of
immutability in the enchanted sleeping castle but though externally
all remained as of old the inner relations of all these people had
changed since prince andrew had seen them last the household was
divided into two alien and hostile camps who changed their habits for
his sake and only met because he was there to the one camp belonged the
old prince mademoiselle bourienne and the architect to the other
princess mary dessalles little nicholas and all the old nurses and
maids

during his stay at bald hills all the family dined together but they
were ill at ease and prince andrew felt that he was a visitor for whose
sake an exception was being made and that his presence made them all
feel awkward involuntarily feeling this at dinner on the first day he
was taciturn and the old prince noticing this also became morosely dumb
and retired to his apartments directly after dinner in the evening
when prince andrew went to him and trying to rouse him began to tell
him of the young count kamenskys campaign the old prince began
unexpectedly to talk about princess mary blaming her for her
superstitions and her dislike of mademoiselle bourienne who he said
was the only person really attached to him

the old prince said that if he was ill it was only because of princess
mary that she purposely worried and irritated him and that by
indulgence and silly talk she was spoiling little prince nicholas the
old prince knew very well that he tormented his daughter and that her
life was very hard but he also knew that he could not help tormenting
her and that she deserved it why does prince andrew who sees this
say nothing to me about his sister does he think me a scoundrel or an
old fool who without any reason keeps his own daughter at a distance
and attaches this frenchwoman to himself he doesnt understand so i
must explain it and he must hear me out thought the old prince and
he began explaining why he could not put up with his daughters
unreasonable character

if you ask me said prince andrew without looking up he was
censuring his father for the first time in his life i did not wish to
speak about it but as you ask me i will give you my frank opinion if
there is any misunderstanding and discord between you and mary i cant
blame her for it at all i know how she loves and respects you since
you ask me continued prince andrew becoming irritableas he was
always liable to do of latei can only say that if there are any
misunderstandings they are caused by that worthless woman who is not
fit to be my sisters companion

the old man at first stared fixedly at his son and an unnatural smile
disclosed the fresh gap between his teeth to which prince andrew could
not get accustomed

what companion my dear boy eh youve already been talking it over
eh

father i did not want to judge said prince andrew in a hard and
bitter tone but you challenged me and i have said and always shall
say that mary is not to blame but those to blamethe one to blameis
that frenchwoman

ah he has passed judgment passed judgement said the old man in a
low voice and as it seemed to prince andrew with some embarrassment
but then he suddenly jumped up and cried be off be off let not a
trace of you remain here

prince andrew wished to leave at once but princess mary persuaded him
to stay another day that day he did not see his father who did not
leave his room and admitted no one but mademoiselle bourienne and
tíkhon but asked several times whether his son had gone next day
before leaving prince andrew went to his sons rooms the boy curly
headed like his mother and glowing with health sat on his knee and
prince andrew began telling him the story of bluebeard but fell into a
reverie without finishing the story he thought not of this pretty
child his son whom he held on his knee but of himself he sought in
himself either remorse for having angered his father or regret at
leaving home for the first time in his life on bad terms with him and
was horrified to find neither what meant still more to him was that he
sought and did not find in himself the former tenderness for his son
which he had hoped to reawaken by caressing the boy and taking him on
his knee

well go on said his son

prince andrew without replying put him down from his knee and went out
of the room

as soon as prince andrew had given up his daily occupations and
especially on returning to the old conditions of life amid which he had
been happy weariness of life overcame him with its former intensity
and he hastened to escape from these memories and to find some work as
soon as possible

so youve decided to go andrew asked his sister

thank god that i can replied prince andrew i am very sorry you
cant

why do you say that replied princess mary why do you say that when
you are going to this terrible war and he is so old mademoiselle
bourienne says he has been asking about you

as soon as she began to speak of that her lips trembled and her tears
began to fall prince andrew turned away and began pacing the room

ah my god my god when one thinks who and whatwhat trashcan cause
people misery he said with a malignity that alarmed princess mary

she understood that when speaking of trash he referred not only to
mademoiselle bourienne the cause of her misery but also to the man who
had ruined his own happiness

andrew one thing i beg i entreat of you she said touching his
elbow and looking at him with eyes that shone through her tears i
understand you she looked down dont imagine that sorrow is the
work of men men are his tools she looked a little above prince
andrews head with the confident accustomed look with which one looks
at the place where a familiar portrait hangs sorrow is sent by him
not by men men are his instruments they are not to blame if you think
someone has wronged you forget it and forgive we have no right to
punish and then you will know the happiness of forgiving

if i were a woman i would do so mary that is a womans virtue but a
man should not and cannot forgive and forget he replied and though
till that moment he had not been thinking of kurágin all his unexpended
anger suddenly swelled up in his heart

if mary is already persuading me to forgive it means that i ought long
ago to have punished him he thought and giving her no further reply
he began thinking of the glad vindictive moment when he would meet
kurágin who he knew was now in the army

princess mary begged him to stay one day more saying that she knew how
unhappy her father would be if andrew left without being reconciled to
him but prince andrew replied that he would probably soon be back again
from the army and would certainly write to his father but that the
longer he stayed now the more embittered their differences would become

goodbye andrew remember that misfortunes come from god and men are
never to blame were the last words he heard from his sister when he
took leave of her

then it must be so thought prince andrew as he drove out of the
avenue from the house at bald hills she poor innocent creature is
left to be victimized by an old man who has outlived his wits the old
man feels he is guilty but cannot change himself my boy is growing up
and rejoices in life in which like everybody else he will deceive or be
deceived and i am off to the army why i myself dont know i want to
meet that man whom i despise so as to give him a chance to kill and
laugh at me

these conditions of life had been the same before but then they were
all connected while now they had all tumbled to pieces only senseless
things lacking coherence presented themselves one after another to
prince andrews mind





chapter ix

prince andrew reached the general headquarters of the army at the end of
june the first army with which was the emperor occupied the fortified
camp at drissa the second army was retreating trying to effect a
junction with the first one from which it was said to be cut off by
large french forces everyone was dissatisfied with the general course
of affairs in the russian army but no one anticipated any danger of
invasion of the russian provinces and no one thought the war would
extend farther than the western the polish provinces

prince andrew found barclay de tolly to whom he had been assigned on
the bank of the drissa as there was not a single town or large village
in the vicinity of the camp the immense number of generals and
courtiers accompanying the army were living in the best houses of the
villages on both sides of the river over a radius of six miles barclay
de tolly was quartered nearly three miles from the emperor he received
bolkónski stiffly and coldly and told him in his foreign accent that he
would mention him to the emperor for a decision as to his employment
but asked him meanwhile to remain on his staff anatole kurágin whom
prince andrew had hoped to find with the army was not there he had
gone to petersburg but prince andrew was glad to hear this his mind
was occupied by the interests of the center that was conducting a
gigantic war and he was glad to be free for a while from the
distraction caused by the thought of kurágin during the first four
days while no duties were required of him prince andrew rode round the
whole fortified camp and by the aid of his own knowledge and by talks
with experts tried to form a definite opinion about it but the
question whether the camp was advantageous or disadvantageous remained
for him undecided already from his military experience and what he had
seen in the austrian campaign he had come to the conclusion that in war
the most deeply considered plans have no significance and that all
depends on the way unexpected movements of the enemythat cannot be
foreseenare met and on how and by whom the whole matter is handled to
clear up this last point for himself prince andrew utilizing his
position and acquaintances tried to fathom the character of the control
of the army and of the men and parties engaged in it and he deduced for
himself the following of the state of affairs

while the emperor had still been at vilna the forces had been divided
into three armies first the army under barclay de tolly secondly the
army under bagration and thirdly the one commanded by tormasov the
emperor was with the first army but not as commanderinchief in the
orders issued it was stated not that the emperor would take command
but only that he would be with the army the emperor moreover had with
him not a commanderinchiefs staff but the imperial headquarters
staff in attendance on him was the head of the imperial staff
quartermaster general prince volkonski as well as generals imperial
aidesdecamp diplomatic officials and a large number of foreigners
but not the army staff besides these there were in attendance on the
emperor without any definite appointments arakcheev the exminister of
war count bennigsen the senior general in rank the grand duke
tsarevich constantine pavlovich count rumyántsev the chancellor
stein a former prussian minister armfeldt a swedish general pfuel
the chief author of the plan of campaign paulucci an adjutant general
and sardinian emigre wolzogenand many others though these men had no
military appointment in the army their position gave them influence
and often a corps commander or even the commanderinchief did not
know in what capacity he was questioned by bennigsen the grand duke
arakcheev or prince volkonski or was given this or that advice and did
not know whether a certain order received in the form of advice emanated
from the man who gave it or from the emperor and whether it had to be
executed or not but this was only the external condition the essential
significance of the presence of the emperor and of all these people
from a courtiers point of view and in an emperors vicinity all became
courtiers was clear to everyone it was this the emperor did not
assume the title of commanderinchief but disposed of all the armies
the men around him were his assistants arakcheev was a faithful
custodian to enforce order and acted as the sovereigns bodyguard
bennigsen was a landlord in the vilna province who appeared to be doing
the honors of the district but was in reality a good general useful as
an adviser and ready at hand to replace barclay the grand duke was
there because it suited him to be the exminister stein was there
because his advice was useful and the emperor alexander held him in high
esteem personally armfeldt virulently hated napoleon and was a general
full of selfconfidence a quality that always influenced alexander
paulucci was there because he was bold and decided in speech the
adjutants general were there because they always accompanied the
emperor and lastly and chiefly pfuel was there because he had drawn up
the plan of campaign against napoleon and having induced alexander to
believe in the efficacy of that plan was directing the whole business
of the war with pfuel was wolzogen who expressed pfuels thoughts in a
more comprehensible way than pfuel himself who was a harsh bookish
theorist selfconfident to the point of despising everyone else was
able to do

besides these russians and foreigners who propounded new and unexpected
ideas every dayespecially the foreigners who did so with a boldness
characteristic of people employed in a country not their ownthere were
many secondary personages accompanying the army because their principals
were there

among the opinions and voices in this immense restless brilliant and
proud sphere prince andrew noticed the following sharply defined
subdivisions of tendencies and parties

the first party consisted of pfuel and his adherentsmilitary theorists
who believed in a science of war with immutable lawslaws of oblique
movements outflankings and so forth pfuel and his adherents demanded
a retirement into the depths of the country in accordance with precise
laws defined by a pseudotheory of war and they saw only barbarism
ignorance or evil intention in every deviation from that theory to
this party belonged the foreign nobles wolzogen wintzingerode and
others chiefly germans

the second party was directly opposed to the first one extreme as
always happens was met by representatives of the other the members of
this party were those who had demanded an advance from vilna into poland
and freedom from all prearranged plans besides being advocates of bold
action this section also represented nationalism which made them still
more onesided in the dispute they were russians bagration ermolov
who was beginning to come to the front and others at that time a
famous joke of ermolovs was being circulated that as a great favor he
had petitioned the emperor to make him a german the men of that party
remembering suvórov said that what one had to do was not to reason or
stick pins into maps but to fight beat the enemy keep him out of
russia and not let the army get discouraged

to the third partyin which the emperor had most confidencebelonged the
courtiers who tried to arrange compromises between the other two the
members of this party chiefly civilians and to whom arakcheev belonged
thought and said what men who have no convictions but wish to seem to
have some generally say they said that undoubtedly war particularly
against such a genius as bonaparte they called him bonaparte now
needs most deeply devised plans and profound scientific knowledge and in
that respect pfuel was a genius but at the same time it had to be
acknowledged that the theorists are often onesided and therefore one
should not trust them absolutely but should also listen to what pfuels
opponents and practical men of experience in warfare had to say and
then choose a middle course they insisted on the retention of the camp
at drissa according to pfuels plan but on changing the movements of
the other armies though by this course neither one aim nor the other
could be attained yet it seemed best to the adherents of this third
party

of a fourth opinion the most conspicuous representative was the
tsarevich who could not forget his disillusionment at austerlitz where
he had ridden out at the head of the guards in his casque and cavalry
uniform as to a review expecting to crush the french gallantly but
unexpectedly finding himself in the front line had narrowly escaped amid
the general confusion the men of this party had both the quality and
the defect of frankness in their opinions they feared napoleon
recognized his strength and their own weakness and frankly said so
they said nothing but sorrow shame and ruin will come of all this
we have abandoned vilna and vitebsk and shall abandon drissa the only
reasonable thing left to do is to conclude peace as soon as possible
before we are turned out of petersburg

this view was very general in the upper army circles and found support
also in petersburg and from the chancellor rumyántsev who for other
reasons of state was in favor of peace

the fifth party consisted of those who were adherents of barclay de
tolly not so much as a man but as minister of war and commanderin
chief be he what he may they always began like that he is an
honest practical man and we have nobody better give him real power
for war cannot be conducted successfully without unity of command and
he will show what he can do as he did in finland if our army is well
organized and strong and has withdrawn to drissa without suffering any
defeats we owe this entirely to barclay if barclay is now to be
superseded by bennigsen all will be lost for bennigsen showed his
incapacity already in

the sixth party the bennigsenites said on the contrary that at any
rate there was no one more active and experienced than bennigsen and
twist about as you may you will have to come to bennigsen eventually
let the others make mistakes now said they arguing that our
retirement to drissa was a most shameful reverse and an unbroken series
of blunders the more mistakes that are made the better it will at any
rate be understood all the sooner that things cannot go on like this
what is wanted is not some barclay or other but a man like bennigsen
who made his mark in  and to whom napoleon himself did justicea
man whose authority would be willingly recognized and bennigsen is the
only such man

the seventh party consisted of the sort of people who are always to be
found especially around young sovereigns and of whom there were
particularly many round alexandergenerals and imperial aidesdecamp
passionately devoted to the emperor not merely as a monarch but as a
man adoring him sincerely and disinterestedly as rostóv had done in
 and who saw in him not only all the virtues but all human
capabilities as well these men though enchanted with the sovereign for
refusing the command of the army yet blamed him for such excessive
modesty and only desired and insisted that their adored sovereign
should abandon his diffidence and openly announce that he would place
himself at the head of the army gather round him a commanderinchiefs
staff and consulting experienced theoreticians and practical men where
necessary would himself lead the troops whose spirits would thereby be
raised to the highest pitch

the eighth and largest group which in its enormous numbers was to the
others as ninetynine to one consisted of men who desired neither peace
nor war neither an advance nor a defensive camp at the drissa or
anywhere else neither barclay nor the emperor neither pfuel nor
bennigsen but only the one most essential thingas much advantage and
pleasure for themselves as possible in the troubled waters of
conflicting and intersecting intrigues that eddied about the emperors
headquarters it was possible to succeed in many ways unthinkable at
other times a man who simply wished to retain his lucrative post would
today agree with pfuel tomorrow with his opponent and the day after
merely to avoid responsibility or to please the emperor would declare
that he had no opinion at all on the matter another who wished to gain
some advantage would attract the emperors attention by loudly
advocating the very thing the emperor had hinted at the day before and
would dispute and shout at the council beating his breast and
challenging those who did not agree with him to duels thereby proving
that he was prepared to sacrifice himself for the common good a third
in the absence of opponents between two councils would simply solicit a
special gratuity for his faithful services well knowing that at that
moment people would be too busy to refuse him a fourth while seemingly
overwhelmed with work would often come accidentally under the emperors
eye a fifth to achieve his longcherished aim of dining with the
emperor would stubbornly insist on the correctness or falsity of some
newly emerging opinion and for this object would produce arguments more
or less forcible and correct

all the men of this party were fishing for rubles decorations and
promotions and in this pursuit watched only the weathercock of imperial
favor and directly they noticed it turning in any direction this whole
drone population of the army began blowing hard that way so that it was
all the harder for the emperor to turn it elsewhere amid the
uncertainties of the position with the menace of serious danger giving
a peculiarly threatening character to everything amid this vortex of
intrigue egotism conflict of views and feelings and the diversity of
race among these peoplethis eighth and largest party of those
preoccupied with personal interests imparted great confusion and
obscurity to the common task whatever question arose a swarm of these
drones without having finished their buzzing on a previous theme flew
over to the new one and by their hum drowned and obscured the voices of
those who were disputing honestly

from among all these parties just at the time prince andrew reached the
army another a ninth party was being formed and was beginning to
raise its voice this was the party of the elders reasonable men
experienced and capable in state affairs who without sharing any of
those conflicting opinions were able to take a detached view of what
was going on at the staff at headquarters and to consider means of
escape from this muddle indecision intricacy and weakness

the men of this party said and thought that what was wrong resulted
chiefly from the emperors presence in the army with his military court
and from the consequent presence there of an indefinite conditional
and unsteady fluctuation of relations which is in place at court but
harmful in an army that a sovereign should reign but not command the
army and that the only way out of the position would be for the emperor
and his court to leave the army that the mere presence of the emperor
paralyzed the action of fifty thousand men required to secure his
personal safety and that the worst commanderinchief if independent
would be better than the very best one trammeled by the presence and
authority of the monarch

just at the time prince andrew was living unoccupied at drissa
shishkov the secretary of state and one of the chief representatives of
this party wrote a letter to the emperor which arakcheev and balashev
agreed to sign in this letter availing himself of permission given him
by the emperor to discuss the general course of affairs he respectfully
suggestedon the plea that it was necessary for the sovereign to arouse
a warlike spirit in the people of the capitalthat the emperor should
leave the army

that arousing of the people by their sovereign and his call to them to
defend their countrythe very incitement which was the chief cause of
russias triumph in so far as it was produced by the tsars personal
presence in moscowwas suggested to the emperor and accepted by him as
a pretext for quitting the army





chapter x

this letter had not yet been presented to the emperor when barclay one
day at dinner informed bolkónski that the sovereign wished to see him
personally to question him about turkey and that prince andrew was to
present himself at bennigsens quarters at six that evening

news was received at the emperors quarters that very day of a fresh
movement by napoleon which might endanger the armynews subsequently
found to be false and that morning colonel michaud had ridden round the
drissa fortifications with the emperor and had pointed out to him that
this fortified camp constructed by pfuel and till then considered a
chefdoeuvre of tactical science which would ensure napoleons
destruction was an absurdity threatening the destruction of the
russian army

prince andrew arrived at bennigsens quartersa country gentlemans
house of moderate size situated on the very banks of the river neither
bennigsen nor the emperor was there but chernyshev the emperors aide
decamp received bolkónski and informed him that the emperor
accompanied by general bennigsen and marquis paulucci had gone a second
time that day to inspect the fortifications of the drissa camp of the
suitability of which serious doubts were beginning to be felt

chernyshev was sitting at a window in the first room with a french novel
in his hand this room had probably been a music room there was still
an organ in it on which some rugs were piled and in one corner stood
the folding bedstead of bennigsens adjutant this adjutant was also
there and sat dozing on the rolledup bedding evidently exhausted by
work or by feasting two doors led from the room one straight on into
what had been the drawing room and another on the right to the study
through the first door came the sound of voices conversing in german and
occasionally in french in that drawing room were gathered by the
emperors wish not a military council the emperor preferred
indefiniteness but certain persons whose opinions he wished to know in
view of the impending difficulties it was not a council of war but as
it were a council to elucidate certain questions for the emperor
personally to this semicouncil had been invited the swedish general
armfeldt adjutant general wolzogen wintzingerode whom napoleon had
referred to as a renegade french subject michaud toll count stein
who was not a military man at all and pfuel himself who as prince
andrew had heard was the mainspring of the whole affair prince andrew
had an opportunity of getting a good look at him for pfuel arrived soon
after himself and in passing through to the drawing room stopped a
minute to speak to chernyshev

at first sight pfuel in his illmade uniform of a russian general
which fitted him badly like a fancy costume seemed familiar to prince
andrew though he saw him now for the first time there was about him
something of weyrother mack and schmidt and many other german
theoristgenerals whom prince andrew had seen in  but he was more
typical than any of them prince andrew had never yet seen a german
theorist in whom all the characteristics of those others were united to
such an extent

pfuel was short and very thin but broadboned of coarse robust build
broad in the hips and with prominent shoulder blades his face was much
wrinkled and his eyes deep set his hair had evidently been hastily
brushed smooth in front of the temples but stuck up behind in quaint
little tufts he entered the room looking restlessly and angrily
around as if afraid of everything in that large apartment awkwardly
holding up his sword he addressed chernyshev and asked in german where
the emperor was one could see that he wished to pass through the rooms
as quickly as possible finish with the bows and greetings and sit down
to business in front of a map where he would feel at home he nodded
hurriedly in reply to chernyshev and smiled ironically on hearing that
the sovereign was inspecting the fortifications that he pfuel had
planned in accord with his theory he muttered something to himself
abruptly and in a bass voice as selfassured germans doit might have
been stupid fellow or the whole affair will be ruined or
something absurd will come of it prince andrew did not catch what
he said and would have passed on but chernyshev introduced him to
pfuel remarking that prince andrew was just back from turkey where the
war had terminated so fortunately pfuel barely glancednot so much at
prince andrew as past himand said with a laugh that must have been a
fine tactical war and laughing contemptuously went on into the room
from which the sound of voices was heard

pfuel always inclined to be irritably sarcastic was particularly
disturbed that day evidently by the fact that they had dared to inspect
and criticize his camp in his absence from this short interview with
pfuel prince andrew thanks to his austerlitz experiences was able to
form a clear conception of the man pfuel was one of those hopelessly
and immutably selfconfident men selfconfident to the point of
martyrdom as only germans are because only germans are selfconfident
on the basis of an abstract notionscience that is the supposed
knowledge of absolute truth a frenchman is selfassured because he
regards himself personally both in mind and body as irresistibly
attractive to men and women an englishman is selfassured as being a
citizen of the bestorganized state in the world and therefore as an
englishman always knows what he should do and knows that all he does as
an englishman is undoubtedly correct an italian is selfassured because
he is excitable and easily forgets himself and other people a russian
is selfassured just because he knows nothing and does not want to know
anything since he does not believe that anything can be known the
germans selfassurance is worst of all stronger and more repulsive
than any other because he imagines that he knows the
truthsciencewhich he himself has invented but which is for him the
absolute truth

pfuel was evidently of that sort he had a sciencethe theory of oblique
movements deduced by him from the history of frederick the greats wars
and all he came across in the history of more recent warfare seemed to
him absurd and barbarousmonstrous collisions in which so many blunders
were committed by both sides that these wars could not be called wars
they did not accord with the theory and therefore could not serve as
material for science

in  pfuel had been one of those responsible for the plan of
campaign that ended in jena and auerstadt but he did not see the least
proof of the fallibility of his theory in the disasters of that war on
the contrary the deviations made from his theory were in his opinion
the sole cause of the whole disaster and with characteristically
gleeful sarcasm he would remark there i said the whole affair would
go to the devil pfuel was one of those theoreticians who so love their
theory that they lose sight of the theorys objectits practical
application his love of theory made him hate everything practical and
he would not listen to it he was even pleased by failures for failures
resulting from deviations in practice from the theory only proved to him
the accuracy of his theory

he said a few words to prince andrew and chernyshev about the present
war with the air of a man who knows beforehand that all will go wrong
and who is not displeased that it should be so the unbrushed tufts of
hair sticking up behind and the hastily brushed hair on his temples
expressed this most eloquently

he passed into the next room and the deep querulous sounds of his
voice were at once heard from there





chapter xi

prince andrews eyes were still following pfuel out of the room when
count bennigsen entered hurriedly and nodding to bolkónski but not
pausing went into the study giving instructions to his adjutant as he
went the emperor was following him and bennigsen had hastened on to
make some preparations and to be ready to receive the sovereign
chernyshev and prince andrew went out into the porch where the emperor
who looked fatigued was dismounting marquis paulucci was talking to
him with particular warmth and the emperor with his head bent to the
left was listening with a dissatisfied air the emperor moved forward
evidently wishing to end the conversation but the flushed and excited
italian oblivious of decorum followed him and continued to speak

and as for the man who advised forming this campthe drissa camp said
paulucci as the emperor mounted the steps and noticing prince andrew
scanned his unfamiliar face as to that person sire continued
paulucci desperately apparently unable to restrain himself the man
who advised the drissa campi see no alternative but the lunatic asylum
or the gallows

without heeding the end of the italians remarks and as though not
hearing them the emperor recognizing bolkónski addressed him
graciously

i am very glad to see you go in there where they are meeting and wait
for me

the emperor went into the study he was followed by prince peter
mikhaylovich volkonski and baron stein and the door closed behind them
prince andrew taking advantage of the emperors permission accompanied
paulucci whom he had known in turkey into the drawing room where the
council was assembled

prince peter mikhaylovich volkonski occupied the position as it were
of chief of the emperors staff he came out of the study into the
drawing room with some maps which he spread on a table and put
questions on which he wished to hear the opinion of the gentlemen
present what had happened was that news which afterwards proved to be
false had been received during the night of a movement by the french to
outflank the drissa camp

the first to speak was general armfeldt who to meet the difficulty that
presented itself unexpectedly proposed a perfectly new position away
from the petersburg and moscow roads the reason for this was
inexplicable unless he wished to show that he too could have an
opinion but he urged that at this point the army should unite and
there await the enemy it was plain that armfeldt had thought out that
plan long ago and now expounded it not so much to answer the questions
putwhich in fact his plan did not answeras to avail himself of the
opportunity to air it it was one of the millions of proposals one as
good as another that could be made as long as it was quite unknown what
character the war would take some disputed his arguments others
defended them young count toll objected to the swedish generals views
more warmly than anyone else and in the course of the dispute drew from
his side pocket a wellfilled notebook which he asked permission to
read to them in these voluminous notes toll suggested another scheme
totally different from armfeldts or pfuels plan of campaign in answer
to toll paulucci suggested an advance and an attack which he urged
could alone extricate us from the present uncertainty and from the trap
as he called the drissa camp in which we were situated

during all these discussions pfuel and his interpreter wolzogen his
bridge in court relations were silent pfuel only snorted
contemptuously and turned away to show that he would never demean
himself by replying to such nonsense as he was now hearing so when
prince volkonski who was in the chair called on him to give his
opinion he merely said

why ask me general armfeldt has proposed a splendid position with an
exposed rear or why not this italian gentlemans attackvery fine or a
retreat also good why ask me said he why you yourselves know
everything better than i do

but when volkonski said with a frown that it was in the emperors name
that he asked his opinion pfuel rose and suddenly growing animated
began to speak

everything has been spoiled everything muddled everybody thought they
knew better than i did and now you come to me how mend matters there
is nothing to mend the principles laid down by me must be strictly
adhered to said he drumming on the table with his bony fingers what
is the difficulty nonsense childishness

he went up to the map and speaking rapidly began proving that no
eventuality could alter the efficiency of the drissa camp that
everything had been foreseen and that if the enemy were really going to
outflank it the enemy would inevitably be destroyed

paulucci who did not know german began questioning him in french
wolzogen came to the assistance of his chief who spoke french badly
and began translating for him hardly able to keep pace with pfuel who
was rapidly demonstrating that not only all that had happened but all
that could happen had been foreseen in his scheme and that if there
were now any difficulties the whole fault lay in the fact that his plan
had not been precisely executed he kept laughing sarcastically he
demonstrated and at last contemptuously ceased to demonstrate like a
mathematician who ceases to prove in various ways the accuracy of a
problem that has already been proved wolzogen took his place and
continued to explain his views in french every now and then turning to
pfuel and saying is it not so your excellency but pfuel like a man
heated in a fight who strikes those on his own side shouted angrily at
his own supporter wolzogen

well of course what more is there to explain

paulucci and michaud both attacked wolzogen simultaneously in french
armfeldt addressed pfuel in german toll explained to volkonski in
russian prince andrew listened and observed in silence

of all these men prince andrew sympathized most with pfuel angry
determined and absurdly selfconfident as he was of all those present
evidently he alone was not seeking anything for himself nursed no
hatred against anyone and only desired that the plan formed on a
theory arrived at by years of toil should be carried out he was
ridiculous and unpleasantly sarcastic but yet he inspired involuntary
respect by his boundless devotion to an idea besides this the remarks
of all except pfuel had one common trait that had not been noticeable at
the council of war in  there was now a panic fear of napoleons
genius which though concealed was noticeable in every rejoinder
everything was assumed to be possible for napoleon they expected him
from every side and invoked his terrible name to shatter each others
proposals pfuel alone seemed to consider napoleon a barbarian like
everyone else who opposed his theory but besides this feeling of
respect pfuel evoked pity in prince andrew from the tone in which the
courtiers addressed him and the way paulucci had allowed himself to
speak of him to the emperor but above all from a certain desperation in
pfuels own expressions it was clear that the others knew and pfuel
himself felt that his fall was at hand and despite his selfconfidence
and grumpy german sarcasm he was pitiable with his hair smoothly
brushed on the temples and sticking up in tufts behind though he
concealed the fact under a show of irritation and contempt he was
evidently in despair that the sole remaining chance of verifying his
theory by a huge experiment and proving its soundness to the whole world
was slipping away from him

the discussions continued a long time and the longer they lasted the
more heated became the disputes culminating in shouts and
personalities and the less was it possible to arrive at any general
conclusion from all that had been said prince andrew listening to this
polyglot talk and to these surmises plans refutations and shouts
felt nothing but amazement at what they were saying a thought that had
long since and often occurred to him during his military activitiesthe
idea that there is not and cannot be any science of war and that
therefore there can be no such thing as a military geniusnow appeared
to him an obvious truth what theory and science is possible about a
matter the conditions and circumstances of which are unknown and cannot
be defined especially when the strength of the acting forces cannot be
ascertained no one was or is able to foresee in what condition our or
the enemys armies will be in a days time and no one can gauge the
force of this or that detachment sometimeswhen there is not a coward
at the front to shout we are cut off and start running but a brave
and jolly lad who shouts hurraha detachment of five thousand is
worth thirty thousand as at schon grabern while at times fifty
thousand run from eight thousand as at austerlitz what science can
there be in a matter in which as in all practical matters nothing can
be defined and everything depends on innumerable conditions the
significance of which is determined at a particular moment which arrives
no one knows when armfeldt says our army is cut in half and paulucci
says we have got the french army between two fires michaud says that
the worthlessness of the drissa camp lies in having the river behind it
and pfuel says that is what constitutes its strength toll proposes one
plan armfeldt another and they are all good and all bad and the
advantages of any suggestions can be seen only at the moment of trial
and why do they all speak of a military genius is a man a genius who
can order bread to be brought up at the right time and say who is to go
to the right and who to the left it is only because military men are
invested with pomp and power and crowds of sychophants flatter power
attributing to it qualities of genius it does not possess the best
generals i have known were on the contrary stupid or absentminded
men bagration was the best napoleon himself admitted that and of
bonaparte himself i remember his limited selfsatisfied face on the
field of austerlitz not only does a good army commander not need any
special qualities on the contrary he needs the absence of the highest
and best human attributeslove poetry tenderness and philosophic
inquiring doubt he should be limited firmly convinced that what he is
doing is very important otherwise he will not have sufficient
patience and only then will he be a brave leader god forbid that he
should be humane should love or pity or think of what is just and
unjust it is understandable that a theory of their genius was
invented for them long ago because they have power the success of a
military action depends not on them but on the man in the ranks who
shouts we are lost or who shouts hurrah and only in the ranks
can one serve with assurance of being useful

so thought prince andrew as he listened to the talking and he roused
himself only when paulucci called him and everyone was leaving

at the review next day the emperor asked prince andrew where he would
like to serve and prince andrew lost his standing in court circles
forever by not asking to remain attached to the sovereigns person but
for permission to serve in the army





chapter xii

before the beginning of the campaign rostóv had received a letter from
his parents in which they told him briefly of natáshas illness and the
breaking off of her engagement to prince andrew which they explained by
natáshas having rejected him and again asked nicholas to retire from
the army and return home on receiving this letter nicholas did not
even make any attempt to get leave of absence or to retire from the
army but wrote to his parents that he was sorry natásha was ill and her
engagement broken off and that he would do all he could to meet their
wishes to sónya he wrote separately

adored friend of my soul he wrote nothing but honor could keep me
from returning to the country but now at the commencement of the
campaign i should feel dishonored not only in my comrades eyes but in
my own if i preferred my own happiness to my love and duty to the
fatherland but this shall be our last separation believe me directly
the war is over if i am still alive and still loved by you i will
throw up everything and fly to you to press you forever to my ardent
breast

it was in fact only the commencement of the campaign that prevented
rostóv from returning home as he had promised and marrying sónya the
autumn in otradnoe with the hunting and the winter with the christmas
holidays and sónyas love had opened out to him a vista of tranquil
rural joys and peace such as he had never known before and which now
allured him a splendid wife children a good pack of hounds a dozen
leashes of smart borzois agriculture neighbors service by
election thought he but now the campaign was beginning and he had
to remain with his regiment and since it had to be so nicholas rostóv
as was natural to him felt contented with the life he led in the
regiment and was able to find pleasure in that life

on his return from his furlough nicholas having been joyfully welcomed
by his comrades was sent to obtain remounts and brought back from the
ukraine excellent horses which pleased him and earned him commendation
from his commanders during his absence he had been promoted captain
and when the regiment was put on war footing with an increase in
numbers he was again allotted his old squadron

the campaign began the regiment was moved into poland on double pay
new officers arrived new men and horses and above all everybody was
infected with the merrily excited mood that goes with the commencement
of a war and rostóv conscious of his advantageous position in the
regiment devoted himself entirely to the pleasures and interests of
military service though he knew that sooner or later he would have to
relinquish them

the troops retired from vilna for various complicated reasons of state
political and strategic each step of the retreat was accompanied by a
complicated interplay of interests arguments and passions at
headquarters for the pávlograd hussars however the whole of this
retreat during the finest period of summer and with sufficient supplies
was a very simple and agreeable business

it was only at headquarters that there was depression uneasiness and
intriguing in the body of the army they did not ask themselves where
they were going or why if they regretted having to retreat it was only
because they had to leave billets they had grown accustomed to or some
pretty young polish lady if the thought that things looked bad chanced
to enter anyones head he tried to be as cheerful as befits a good
soldier and not to think of the general trend of affairs but only of
the task nearest to hand first they camped gaily before vilna making
acquaintance with the polish landowners preparing for reviews and being
reviewed by the emperor and other high commanders then came an order to
retreat to sventsyani and destroy any provisions they could not carry
away with them sventsyani was remembered by the hussars only as the
drunken camp a name the whole army gave to their encampment there and
because many complaints were made against the troops who taking
advantage of the order to collect provisions took also horses
carriages and carpets from the polish proprietors rostóv remembered
sventsyani because on the first day of their arrival at that small town
he changed his sergeant major and was unable to manage all the drunken
men of his squadron who unknown to him had appropriated five barrels
of old beer from sventsyani they retired farther and farther to drissa
and thence again beyond drissa drawing near to the frontier of russia
proper

on the thirteenth of july the pávlograds took part in a serious action
for the first time

on the twelfth of july on the eve of that action there was a heavy
storm of rain and hail in general the summer of  was remarkable
for its storms

the two pávlograd squadrons were bivouacking on a field of rye which
was already in ear but had been completely trodden down by cattle and
horses the rain was descending in torrents and rostóv with a young
officer named ilyin his protege was sitting in a hastily constructed
shelter an officer of their regiment with long mustaches extending
onto his cheeks who after riding to the staff had been overtaken by the
rain entered rostóvs shelter

i have come from the staff count have you heard of raevskis
exploit

and the officer gave them details of the saltanov battle which he had
heard at the staff

rostóv smoking his pipe and turning his head about as the water
trickled down his neck listened inattentively with an occasional
glance at ilyin who was pressing close to him this officer a lad of
sixteen who had recently joined the regiment was now in the same
relation to nicholas that nicholas had been to denisov seven years
before ilyin tried to imitate rostóv in everything and adored him as a
girl might have done

zdrzhinski the officer with the long mustache spoke grandiloquently of
the saltanov dam being a russian thermopylae and of how a deed worthy
of antiquity had been performed by general raevski he recounted how
raevski had led his two sons onto the dam under terrific fire and had
charged with them beside him rostóv heard the story and not only said
nothing to encourage zdrzhinskis enthusiasm but on the contrary
looked like a man ashamed of what he was hearing though with no
intention of contradicting it since the campaigns of austerlitz and of
 rostóv knew by experience that men always lie when describing
military exploits as he himself had done when recounting them besides
that he had experience enough to know that nothing happens in war at
all as we can imagine or relate it and so he did not like zdrzhinskis
tale nor did he like zdrzhinski himself who with his mustaches
extending over his cheeks bent low over the face of his hearer as was
his habit and crowded rostóv in the narrow shanty rostóv looked at him
in silence in the first place there must have been such a confusion
and crowding on the dam that was being attacked that if raevski did lead
his sons there it could have had no effect except perhaps on some dozen
men nearest to him thought he the rest could not have seen how or
with whom raevski came onto the dam and even those who did see it would
not have been much stimulated by it for what had they to do with
raevskis tender paternal feelings when their own skins were in danger
and besides the fate of the fatherland did not depend on whether they
took the saltanov dam or not as we are told was the case at
thermopylae so why should he have made such a sacrifice and why expose
his own children in the battle i would not have taken my brother pétya
there or even ilyin whos a stranger to me but a nice lad but would
have tried to put them somewhere under cover nicholas continued to
think as he listened to zdrzhinski but he did not express his
thoughts for in such matters too he had gained experience he knew
that this tale redounded to the glory of our arms and so one had to
pretend not to doubt it and he acted accordingly

i cant stand this any more said ilyin noticing that rostóv did not
relish zdrzhinskis conversation my stockings and shirt and the
water is running on my seat ill go and look for shelter the rain
seems less heavy

ilyin went out and zdrzhinski rode away

five minutes later ilyin splashing through the mud came running back
to the shanty

hurrah rostóv come quick ive found it about two hundred yards away
theres a tavern where ours have already gathered we can at least get
dry there and mary hendrikhovnas there

mary hendrikhovna was the wife of the regimental doctor a pretty young
german woman he had married in poland the doctor whether from lack of
means or because he did not like to part from his young wife in the
early days of their marriage took her about with him wherever the
hussar regiment went and his jealousy had become a standing joke among
the hussar officers

rostóv threw his cloak over his shoulders shouted to lavrushka to
follow with the things andnow slipping in the mud now splashing right
through itset off with ilyin in the lessening rain and the darkness
that was occasionally rent by distant lightning

rostóv where are you

here what lightning they called to one another





chapter xiii

in the tavern before which stood the doctors covered cart there were
already some five officers mary hendrikhovna a plump little blonde
german in a dressing jacket and nightcap was sitting on a broad bench
in the front corner her husband the doctor lay asleep behind her
rostóv and ilyin on entering the room were welcomed with merry shouts
and laughter

dear me how jolly we are said rostóv laughing

and why do you stand there gaping

what swells they are why the water streams from them dont make our
drawing room so wet

dont mess mary hendrikhovnas dress cried other voices

rostóv and ilyin hastened to find a corner where they could change into
dry clothes without offending mary hendrikhovnas modesty they were
going into a tiny recess behind a partition to change but found it
completely filled by three officers who sat playing cards by the light
of a solitary candle on an empty box and these officers would on no
account yield their position mary hendrikhovna obliged them with the
loan of a petticoat to be used as a curtain and behind that screen
rostóv and ilyin helped by lavrushka who had brought their kits
changed their wet things for dry ones

a fire was made up in the dilapidated brick stove a board was found
fixed on two saddles and covered with a horsecloth a small samovar was
produced and a cellaret and half a bottle of rum and having asked mary
hendrikhovna to preside they all crowded round her one offered her a
clean handkerchief to wipe her charming hands another spread a jacket
under her little feet to keep them from the damp another hung his coat
over the window to keep out the draft and yet another waved the flies
off her husbands face lest he should wake up

leave him alone said mary hendrikhovna smiling timidly and happily
he is sleeping well as it is after a sleepless night

oh no mary hendrikhovna replied the officer one must look after
the doctor perhaps hell take pity on me someday when it comes to
cutting off a leg or an arm for me

there were only three tumblers the water was so muddy that one could
not make out whether the tea was strong or weak and the samovar held
only six tumblers of water but this made it all the pleasanter to take
turns in order of seniority to receive ones tumbler from mary
hendrikhovnas plump little hands with their short and not overclean
nails all the officers appeared to be and really were in love with
her that evening even those playing cards behind the partition soon
left their game and came over to the samovar yielding to the general
mood of courting mary hendrikhovna she seeing herself surrounded by
such brilliant and polite young men beamed with satisfaction try as
she might to hide it and perturbed as she evidently was each time her
husband moved in his sleep behind her

there was only one spoon sugar was more plentiful than anything else
but it took too long to dissolve so it was decided that mary
hendrikhovna should stir the sugar for everyone in turn rostóv received
his tumbler and adding some rum to it asked mary hendrikhovna to stir
it

but you take it without sugar she said smiling all the time as if
everything she said and everything the others said was very amusing and
had a double meaning

it is not the sugar i want but only that your little hand should stir
my tea

mary hendrikhovna assented and began looking for the spoon which someone
meanwhile had pounced on

use your finger mary hendrikhovna it will be still nicer said
rostóv

too hot she replied blushing with pleasure

ilyin put a few drops of rum into the bucket of water and brought it to
mary hendrikhovna asking her to stir it with her finger

this is my cup said he only dip your finger in it and ill drink it
all up

when they had emptied the samovar rostóv took a pack of cards and
proposed that they should play kings with mary hendrikhovna they drew
lots to settle who should make up her set at rostóvs suggestion it was
agreed that whoever became king should have the right to kiss mary
hendrikhovnas hand and that the booby should go to refill and reheat
the samovar for the doctor when the latter awoke

well but supposing mary hendrikhovna is king asked ilyin

as it is she is queen and her word is law

they had hardly begun to play before the doctors disheveled head
suddenly appeared from behind mary hendrikhovna he had been awake for
some time listening to what was being said and evidently found nothing
entertaining or amusing in what was going on his face was sad and
depressed without greeting the officers he scratched himself and asked
to be allowed to pass as they were blocking the way as soon as he had
left the room all the officers burst into loud laughter and mary
hendrikhovna blushed till her eyes filled with tears and thereby became
still more attractive to them returning from the yard the doctor told
his wife who had ceased to smile so happily and looked at him in
alarm awaiting her sentence that the rain had ceased and they must go
to sleep in their covered cart or everything in it would be stolen

but ill send an orderly two of them said rostóv what an idea
doctor

ill stand guard on it myself said ilyin

no gentlemen you have had your sleep but i have not slept for two
nights replied the doctor and he sat down morosely beside his wife
waiting for the game to end

seeing his gloomy face as he frowned at his wife the officers grew
still merrier and some of them could not refrain from laughter for
which they hurriedly sought plausible pretexts when he had gone taking
his wife with him and had settled down with her in their covered cart
the officers lay down in the tavern covering themselves with their wet
cloaks but they did not sleep for a long time now they exchanged
remarks recalling the doctors uneasiness and his wifes delight now
they ran out into the porch and reported what was taking place in the
covered trap several times rostóv covering his head tried to go to
sleep but some remark would arouse him and conversation would be
resumed to the accompaniment of unreasoning merry childlike laughter





chapter xiv

it was nearly three oclock but no one was yet asleep when the
quartermaster appeared with an order to move on to the little town of
ostrovna still laughing and talking the officers began hurriedly
getting ready and again boiled some muddy water in the samovar but
rostóv went off to his squadron without waiting for tea day was
breaking the rain had ceased and the clouds were dispersing it felt
damp and cold especially in clothes that were still moist as they left
the tavern in the twilight of the dawn rostóv and ilyin both glanced
under the wet and glistening leather hood of the doctors cart from
under the apron of which his feet were sticking out and in the middle
of which his wifes nightcap was visible and her sleepy breathing
audible

she really is a dear little thing said rostóv to ilyin who was
following him

a charming woman said ilyin with all the gravity of a boy of
sixteen

half an hour later the squadron was lined up on the road the command
was heard to mount and the soldiers crossed themselves and mounted
rostóv riding in front gave the order forward and the hussars with
clanking sabers and subdued talk their horses hoofs splashing in the
mud defiled in fours and moved along the broad road planted with birch
trees on each side following the infantry and a battery that had gone
on in front

tattered bluepurple clouds reddening in the east were scudding
before the wind it was growing lighter and lighter that curly grass
which always grows by country roadsides became clearly visible still
wet with the nights rain the drooping branches of the birches also
wet swayed in the wind and flung down bright drops of water to one
side the soldiers faces were more and more clearly visible rostóv
always closely followed by ilyin rode along the side of the road
between two rows of birch trees

when campaigning rostóv allowed himself the indulgence of riding not a
regimental but a cossack horse a judge of horses and a sportsman he
had lately procured himself a large fine mettlesome donets horse
duncolored with light mane and tail and when he rode it no one could
outgallop him to ride this horse was a pleasure to him and he thought
of the horse of the morning of the doctors wife but not once of the
impending danger

formerly when going into action rostóv had felt afraid now he had not
the least feeling of fear he was fearless not because he had grown
used to being under fire one cannot grow used to danger but because
he had learned how to manage his thoughts when in danger he had grown
accustomed when going into action to think about anything but what would
seem most likely to interest himthe impending danger during the first
period of his service hard as he tried and much as he reproached
himself with cowardice he had not been able to do this but with time
it had come of itself now he rode beside ilyin under the birch trees
occasionally plucking leaves from a branch that met his hand sometimes
touching his horses side with his foot or without turning round
handing a pipe he had finished to an hussar riding behind him with as
calm and careless an air as though he were merely out for a ride he
glanced with pity at the excited face of ilyin who talked much and in
great agitation he knew from experience the tormenting expectation of
terror and death the cornet was suffering and knew that only time could
help him

as soon as the sun appeared in a clear strip of sky beneath the clouds
the wind fell as if it dared not spoil the beauty of the summer morning
after the storm drops still continued to fall but vertically now and
all was still the whole sun appeared on the horizon and disappeared
behind a long narrow cloud that hung above it a few minutes later it
reappeared brighter still from behind the top of the cloud tearing its
edge everything grew bright and glittered and with that light and as
if in reply to it came the sound of guns ahead of them

before rostóv had had time to consider and determine the distance of
that firing count ostermanntolstóy s adjutant came galloping from
vitebsk with orders to advance at a trot along the road

the squadron overtook and passed the infantry and the batterywhich had
also quickened their pacerode down a hill and passing through an empty
and deserted village again ascended the horses began to lather and the
men to flush

halt dress your ranks the order of the regimental commander was
heard ahead forward by the left walk march came the order from in
front

and the hussars passing along the line of troops on the left flank of
our position halted behind our uhlans who were in the front line to
the right stood our infantry in a dense column they were the reserve
higher up the hill on the very horizon our guns were visible through
the wonderfully clear air brightly illuminated by slanting morning
sunbeams in front beyond a hollow dale could be seen the enemys
columns and guns our advanced line already in action could be heard
briskly exchanging shots with the enemy in the dale

at these sounds long unheard rostóvs spirits rose as at the strains
of the merriest music traptatatap cracked the shots now together
now several quickly one after another again all was silent and then
again it sounded as if someone were walking on detonators and exploding
them

the hussars remained in the same place for about an hour a cannonade
began count ostermann with his suite rode up behind the squadron
halted spoke to the commander of the regiment and rode up the hill to
the guns

after ostermann had gone a command rang out to the uhlans

form column prepare to charge

the infantry in front of them parted into platoons to allow the cavalry
to pass the uhlans started the streamers on their spears fluttering
and trotted downhill toward the french cavalry which was seen below to
the left

as soon as the uhlans descended the hill the hussars were ordered up
the hill to support the battery as they took the places vacated by the
uhlans bullets came from the front whining and whistling but fell
spent without taking effect

the sounds which he had not heard for so long had an even more
pleasurable and exhilarating effect on rostóv than the previous sounds
of firing drawing himself up he viewed the field of battle opening out
before him from the hill and with his whole soul followed the movement
of the uhlans they swooped down close to the french dragoons something
confused happened there amid the smoke and five minutes later our
uhlans were galloping back not to the place they had occupied but more
to the left and among the orangecolored uhlans on chestnut horses and
behind them in a large group blue french dragoons on gray horses could
be seen





chapter xv

rostóv with his keen sportsmans eye was one of the first to catch
sight of these blue french dragoons pursuing our uhlans nearer and
nearer in disorderly crowds came the uhlans and the french dragoons
pursuing them he could already see how these men who looked so small
at the foot of the hill jostled and overtook one another waving their
arms and their sabers in the air

rostóv gazed at what was happening before him as at a hunt he felt
instinctively that if the hussars struck at the french dragoons now the
latter could not withstand them but if a charge was to be made it must
be done now at that very moment or it would be too late he looked
around a captain standing beside him was gazing like himself with
eyes fixed on the cavalry below them

andrew sevastyanych said rostóv you know we could crush them

a fine thing too replied the captain and really

rostóv without waiting to hear him out touched his horse galloped to
the front of his squadron and before he had time to finish giving the
word of command the whole squadron sharing his feeling was following
him rostóv himself did not know how or why he did it he acted as he
did when hunting without reflecting or considering he saw the dragoons
near and that they were galloping in disorder he knew they could not
withstand an attackknew there was only that moment and that if he let
it slip it would not return the bullets were whining and whistling so
stimulatingly around him and his horse was so eager to go that he could
not restrain himself he touched his horse gave the word of command
and immediately hearing behind him the tramp of the horses of his
deployed squadron rode at full trot downhill toward the dragoons
hardly had they reached the bottom of the hill before their pace
instinctively changed to a gallop which grew faster and faster as they
drew nearer to our uhlans and the french dragoons who galloped after
them the dragoons were now close at hand on seeing the hussars the
foremost began to turn while those behind began to halt with the same
feeling with which he had galloped across the path of a wolf rostóv
gave rein to his donets horse and galloped to intersect the path of the
dragoons disordered lines one uhlan stopped another who was on foot
flung himself to the ground to avoid being knocked over and a riderless
horse fell in among the hussars nearly all the french dragoons were
galloping back rostóv picking out one on a gray horse dashed after
him on the way he came upon a bush his gallant horse cleared it and
almost before he had righted himself in his saddle he saw that he would
immediately overtake the enemy he had selected that frenchman by his
uniform an officer was going at a gallop crouching on his gray horse
and urging it on with his saber in another moment rostóvs horse dashed
its breast against the hindquarters of the officers horse almost
knocking it over and at the same instant rostóv without knowing why
raised his saber and struck the frenchman with it

the instant he had done this all rostóvs animation vanished the
officer fell not so much from the blowwhich had but slightly cut his
arm above the elbowas from the shock to his horse and from fright
rostóv reined in his horse and his eyes sought his foe to see whom he
had vanquished the french dragoon officer was hopping with one foot on
the ground the other being caught in the stirrup his eyes screwed up
with fear as if he every moment expected another blow gazed up at
rostóv with shrinking terror his pale and mudstained facefair and
young with a dimple in the chin and lightblue eyeswas not an enemys
face at all suited to a battlefield but a most ordinary homelike face
before rostóv had decided what to do with him the officer cried i
surrender he hurriedly but vainly tried to get his foot out of the
stirrup and did not remove his frightened blue eyes from rostóvs face
some hussars who galloped up disengaged his foot and helped him into the
saddle on all sides the hussars were busy with the dragoons one was
wounded but though his face was bleeding he would not give up his
horse another was perched up behind an hussar with his arms round him
a third was being helped by an hussar to mount his horse in front the
french infantry were firing as they ran the hussars galloped hastily
back with their prisoners rostóv galloped back with the rest aware of
an unpleasant feeling of depression in his heart something vague and
confused which he could not at all account for had come over him with
the capture of that officer and the blow he had dealt him

count ostermanntolstóy met the returning hussars sent for rostóv
thanked him and said he would report his gallant deed to the emperor
and would recommend him for a st georges cross when sent for by count
ostermann rostóv remembering that he had charged without orders felt
sure his commander was sending for him to punish him for breach of
discipline ostermanns flattering words and promise of a reward should
therefore have struck him all the more pleasantly but he still felt
that same vaguely disagreeable feeling of moral nausea but what on
earth is worrying me he asked himself as he rode back from the
general ilyin no hes safe have i disgraced myself in any way no
thats not it something else resembling remorse tormented him yes
oh yes that french officer with the dimple and i remember how my arm
paused when i raised it

rostóv saw the prisoners being led away and galloped after them to have
a look at his frenchman with the dimple on his chin he was sitting in
his foreign uniform on an hussar packhorse and looked anxiously about
him the sword cut on his arm could scarcely be called a wound he
glanced at rostóv with a feigned smile and waved his hand in greeting
rostóv still had the same indefinite feeling as of shame

all that day and the next his friends and comrades noticed that rostóv
without being dull or angry was silent thoughtful and preoccupied he
drank reluctantly tried to remain alone and kept turning something
over in his mind

rostóv was always thinking about that brilliant exploit of his which to
his amazement had gained him the st georges cross and even given him a
reputation for bravery and there was something he could not at all
understand so others are even more afraid than i am he thought so
thats all there is in what is called heroism and did i do it for my
countrys sake and how was he to blame with his dimple and blue eyes
and how frightened he was he thought that i should kill him why should
i kill him my hand trembled and they have given me a st georges
cross i cant make it out at all

but while nicholas was considering these questions and still could reach
no clear solution of what puzzled him so the wheel of fortune in the
service as often happens turned in his favor after the affair at
ostrovna he was brought into notice received command of an hussar
battalion and when a brave officer was needed he was chosen





chapter xvi

on receiving news of natáshas illness the countess though not quite
well yet and still weak went to moscow with pétya and the rest of the
household and the whole family moved from márya dmítrievnas house to
their own and settled down in town

natáshas illness was so serious that fortunately for her and for her
parents the consideration of all that had caused the illness her
conduct and the breaking off of her engagement receded into the
background she was so ill that it was impossible for them to consider
in how far she was to blame for what had happened she could not eat or
sleep grew visibly thinner coughed and as the doctors made them
feel was in danger they could not think of anything but how to help
her doctors came to see her singly and in consultation talked much in
french german and latin blamed one another and prescribed a great
variety of medicines for all the diseases known to them but the simple
idea never occurred to any of them that they could not know the disease
natásha was suffering from as no disease suffered by a live man can be
known for every living person has his own peculiarities and always has
his own peculiar personal novel complicated disease unknown to
medicinenot a disease of the lungs liver skin heart nerves and so
on mentioned in medical books but a disease consisting of one of the
innumerable combinations of the maladies of those organs this simple
thought could not occur to the doctors as it cannot occur to a wizard
that he is unable to work his charms because the business of their
lives was to cure and they received money for it and had spent the best
years of their lives on that business but above all that thought was
kept out of their minds by the fact that they saw they were really
useful as in fact they were to the whole rostóv family their
usefulness did not depend on making the patient swallow substances for
the most part harmful the harm was scarcely perceptible as they were
given in small doses but they were useful necessary and
indispensable because they satisfied a mental need of the invalid and of
those who loved herand that is why there are and always will be
pseudohealers wise women homeopaths and allopaths they satisfied
that eternal human need for hope of relief for sympathy and that
something should be done which is felt by those who are suffering they
satisfied the need seen in its most elementary form in a child when it
wants to have a place rubbed that has been hurt a child knocks itself
and runs at once to the arms of its mother or nurse to have the aching
spot rubbed or kissed and it feels better when this is done the child
cannot believe that the strongest and wisest of its people have no
remedy for its pain and the hope of relief and the expression of its
mothers sympathy while she rubs the bump comforts it the doctors were
of use to natásha because they kissed and rubbed her bump assuring her
that it would soon pass if only the coachman went to the chemists in
the arbat and got a powder and some pills in a pretty box for a ruble
and seventy kopeks and if she took those powders in boiled water at
intervals of precisely two hours neither more nor less

what would sónya and the count and countess have done how would they
have looked if nothing had been done if there had not been those pills
to give by the clock the warm drinks the chicken cutlets and all the
other details of life ordered by the doctors the carrying out of which
supplied an occupation and consolation to the family circle how would
the count have borne his dearly loved daughters illness had he not
known that it was costing him a thousand rubles and that he would not
grudge thousands more to benefit her or had he not known that if her
illness continued he would not grudge yet other thousands and would take
her abroad for consultations there and had he not been able to explain
the details of how metivier and feller had not understood the symptoms
but frise had and mudrov had diagnosed them even better what would the
countess have done had she not been able sometimes to scold the invalid
for not strictly obeying the doctors orders

youll never get well like that she would say forgetting her grief
in her vexation if you wont obey the doctor and take your medicine at
the right time you mustnt trifle with it you know or it may turn to
pneumonia she would go on deriving much comfort from the utterance of
that foreign word incomprehensible to others as well as to herself

what would sónya have done without the glad consciousness that she had
not undressed during the first three nights in order to be ready to
carry out all the doctors injunctions with precision and that she
still kept awake at night so as not to miss the proper time when the
slightly harmful pills in the little gilt box had to be administered
even to natásha herself it was pleasant to see that so many sacrifices
were being made for her sake and to know that she had to take medicine
at certain hours though she declared that no medicine would cure her
and that it was all nonsense and it was even pleasant to be able to
show by disregarding the orders that she did not believe in medical
treatment and did not value her life

the doctor came every day felt her pulse looked at her tongue and
regardless of her griefstricken face joked with her but when he had
gone into another room to which the countess hurriedly followed him he
assumed a grave air and thoughtfully shaking his head said that though
there was danger he had hopes of the effect of this last medicine and
one must wait and see that the malady was chiefly mental but and
the countess trying to conceal the action from herself and from him
slipped a gold coin into his hand and always returned to the patient
with a more tranquil mind

the symptoms of natáshas illness were that she ate little slept
little coughed and was always lowspirited the doctors said that she
could not get on without medical treatment so they kept her in the
stifling atmosphere of the town and the rostóvs did not move to the
country that summer of

in spite of the many pills she swallowed and the drops and powders out
of the little bottles and boxes of which madame schoss who was fond of
such things made a large collection and in spite of being deprived of
the country life to which she was accustomed youth prevailed natáshas
grief began to be overlaid by the impressions of daily life it ceased
to press so painfully on her heart it gradually faded into the past
and she began to recover physically





chapter xvii

natásha was calmer but no happier she not merely avoided all external
forms of pleasureballs promenades concerts and theatersbut she
never laughed without a sound of tears in her laughter she could not
sing as soon as she began to laugh or tried to sing by herself tears
choked her tears of remorse tears at the recollection of those pure
times which could never return tears of vexation that she should so
uselessly have ruined her young life which might have been so happy
laughter and singing in particular seemed to her like a blasphemy in
face of her sorrow without any need of selfrestraint no wish to
coquet ever entered her head she said and felt at that time that no man
was more to her than nastasya ivánovna the buffoon something stood
sentinel within her and forbade her every joy besides she had lost all
the old interests of her carefree girlish life that had been so full of
hope the previous autumn the hunting uncle and the christmas
holidays spent with nicholas at otradnoe were what she recalled oftenest
and most painfully what would she not have given to bring back even a
single day of that time but it was gone forever her presentiment at
the time had not deceived herthat that state of freedom and readiness
for any enjoyment would not return again yet it was necessary to live
on

it comforted her to reflect that she was not better as she had formerly
imagined but worse much worse than anybody else in the world but
this was not enough she knew that and asked herself what next but
there was nothing to come there was no joy in life yet life was
passing natásha apparently tried not to be a burden or a hindrance to
anyone but wanted nothing for herself she kept away from everyone in
the house and felt at ease only with her brother pétya she liked to be
with him better than with the others and when alone with him she
sometimes laughed she hardly ever left the house and of those who came
to see them was glad to see only one person pierre it would have been
impossible to treat her with more delicacy greater care and at the
same time more seriously than did count bezúkhov natásha unconsciously
felt this delicacy and so found great pleasure in his society but she
was not even grateful to him for it nothing good on pierres part
seemed to her to be an effort it seemed so natural for him to be kind
to everyone that there was no merit in his kindness sometimes natásha
noticed embarrassment and awkwardness on his part in her presence
especially when he wanted to do something to please her or feared that
something they spoke of would awaken memories distressing to her she
noticed this and attributed it to his general kindness and shyness
which she imagined must be the same toward everyone as it was to her
after those involuntary wordsthat if he were free he would have asked
on his knees for her hand and her loveuttered at a moment when she was
so strongly agitated pierre never spoke to natásha of his feelings and
it seemed plain to her that those words which had then so comforted
her were spoken as all sorts of meaningless words are spoken to comfort
a crying child it was not because pierre was a married man but because
natásha felt very strongly with him that moral barrier the absence of
which she had experienced with kurágin that it never entered her head
that the relations between him and herself could lead to love on her
part still less on his or even to the kind of tender selfconscious
romantic friendship between a man and a woman of which she had known
several instances

before the end of the fast of st peter agrafena ivánovna belova a
country neighbor of the rostóvs came to moscow to pay her devotions at
the shrines of the moscow saints she suggested that natásha should fast
and prepare for holy communion and natásha gladly welcomed the idea
despite the doctors orders that she should not go out early in the
morning natásha insisted on fasting and preparing for the sacrament
not as they generally prepared for it in the rostóv family by attending
three services in their own house but as agrafena ivánovna did by
going to church every day for a week and not once missing vespers
matins or mass

the countess was pleased with natáshas zeal after the poor results of
the medical treatment in the depths of her heart she hoped that prayer
might help her daughter more than medicines and though not without fear
and concealing it from the doctor she agreed to natáshas wish and
entrusted her to belova agrafena ivánovna used to come to wake natásha
at three in the morning but generally found her already awake she was
afraid of being late for matins hastily washing and meekly putting on
her shabbiest dress and an old mantilla natásha shivering in the fresh
air went out into the deserted streets lit by the clear light of dawn
by agrafena ivánovnas advice natásha prepared herself not in their own
parish but at a church where according to the devout agrafena
ivánovna the priest was a man of very severe and lofty life there were
never many people in the church natásha always stood beside belova in
the customary place before an icon of the blessed virgin let into the
screen before the choir on the left side and a feeling new to her of
humility before something great and incomprehensible seized her when at
that unusual morning hour gazing at the dark face of the virgin
illuminated by the candles burning before it and by the morning light
falling from the window she listened to the words of the service which
she tried to follow with understanding when she understood them her
personal feeling became interwoven in the prayers with shades of its
own when she did not understand it was sweeter still to think that the
wish to understand everything is pride that it is impossible to
understand all that it is only necessary to believe and to commit
oneself to god whom she felt guiding her soul at those moments she
crossed herself bowed low and when she did not understand in horror
at her own vileness simply asked god to forgive her everything
everything to have mercy upon her the prayers to which she surrendered
herself most of all were those of repentance on her way home at an
early hour when she met no one but bricklayers going to work or men
sweeping the street and everybody within the houses was still asleep
natásha experienced a feeling new to her a sense of the possibility of
correcting her faults the possibility of a new clean life and of
happiness

during the whole week she spent in this way that feeling grew every
day and the happiness of taking communion or communing as agrafena
ivánovna joyously playing with the word called it seemed to natásha
so great that she felt she should never live till that blessed sunday

but the happy day came and on that memorable sunday when dressed in
white muslin she returned home after communion for the first time for
many months she felt calm and not oppressed by the thought of the life
that lay before her

the doctor who came to see her that day ordered her to continue the
powders he had prescribed a fortnight previously

she must certainly go on taking them morning and evening said he
evidently sincerely satisfied with his success only please be
particular about it

be quite easy he continued playfully as he adroitly took the gold
coin in his palm she will soon be singing and frolicking about the
last medicine has done her a very great deal of good she has freshened
up very much

the countess with a cheerful expression on her face looked down at her
nails and spat a little for luck as she returned to the drawing room





chapter xviii

at the beginning of july more and more disquieting reports about the war
began to spread in moscow people spoke of an appeal by the emperor to
the people and of his coming himself from the army to moscow and as up
to the eleventh of july no manifesto or appeal had been received
exaggerated reports became current about them and about the position of
russia it was said that the emperor was leaving the army because it was
in danger it was said that smolensk had surrendered that napoleon had
an army of a million and only a miracle could save russia

on the eleventh of july which was saturday the manifesto was received
but was not yet in print and pierre who was at the rostóvs promised
to come to dinner next day sunday and bring a copy of the manifesto
and appeal which he would obtain from count rostopchin

that sunday the rostóvs went to mass at the razumóvskis private chapel
as usual it was a hot july day even at ten oclock when the rostóvs
got out of their carriage at the chapel the sultry air the shouts of
hawkers the light and gay summer clothes of the crowd the dusty leaves
of the trees on the boulevard the sounds of the band and the white
trousers of a battalion marching to parade the rattling of wheels on
the cobblestones and the brilliant hot sunshine were all full of that
summer languor that content and discontent with the present which is
most strongly felt on a bright hot day in town all the moscow
notabilities all the rostóvs acquaintances were at the razumóvskis
chapel for as if expecting something to happen many wealthy families
who usually left town for their country estates had not gone away that
summer as natásha at her mothers side passed through the crowd
behind a liveried footman who cleared the way for them she heard a
young man speaking about her in too loud a whisper

thats rostóva the one who

shes much thinner but all the same shes pretty

she heard or thought she heard the names of kurágin and bolkónski but
she was always imagining that it always seemed to her that everyone who
looked at her was thinking only of what had happened to her with a
sinking heart wretched as she always was now when she found herself in
a crowd natásha in her lilac silk dress trimmed with black lace
walkedas women can walkwith the more repose and stateliness the
greater the pain and shame in her soul she knew for certain that she
was pretty but this no longer gave her satisfaction as it used to on
the contrary it tormented her more than anything else of late and
particularly so on this bright hot summer day in town its sunday
againanother week past she thought recalling that she had been here
the sunday before and always the same life that is no life and the
same surroundings in which it used to be so easy to live im pretty
im young and i know that now i am good i used to be bad but now i
know i am good she thought but yet my best years are slipping by and
are no good to anyone she stood by her mothers side and exchanged
nods with acquaintances near her from habit she scrutinized the ladies
dresses condemned the bearing of a lady standing close by who was not
crossing herself properly but in a cramped manner and again she thought
with vexation that she was herself being judged and was judging others
and suddenly at the sound of the service she felt horrified at her own
vileness horrified that the former purity of her soul was again lost to
her

a comely freshlooking old man was conducting the service with that
mild solemnity which has so elevating and soothing an effect on the
souls of the worshipers the gates of the sanctuary screen were closed
the curtain was slowly drawn and from behind it a soft mysterious voice
pronounced some words tears the cause of which she herself did not
understand made natáshas breast heave and a joyous but oppressive
feeling agitated her

teach me what i should do how to live my life how i may grow good
forever forever she pleaded

the deacon came out onto the raised space before the altar screen and
holding his thumb extended drew his long hair from under his dalmatic
and making the sign of the cross on his breast began in a loud and
solemn voice to recite the words of the prayer

in peace let us pray unto the lord

as one community without distinction of class without enmity united
by brotherly lovelet us pray thought natásha

for the peace that is from above and for the salvation of our souls

for the world of angels and all the spirits who dwell above us prayed
natásha

when they prayed for the warriors she thought of her brother and
denisov when they prayed for all traveling by land and sea she
remembered prince andrew prayed for him and asked god to forgive her
all the wrongs she had done him when they prayed for those who love us
she prayed for the members of her own family her father and mother and
sónya realizing for the first time how wrongly she had acted toward
them and feeling all the strength of her love for them when they
prayed for those who hate us she tried to think of her enemies and
people who hated her in order to pray for them she included among her
enemies the creditors and all who had business dealings with her father
and always at the thought of enemies and those who hated her she
remembered anatole who had done her so much harmand though he did not
hate her she gladly prayed for him as for an enemy only at prayer did
she feel able to think clearly and calmly of prince andrew and anatole
as men for whom her feelings were as nothing compared with her awe and
devotion to god when they prayed for the imperial family and the synod
she bowed very low and made the sign of the cross saying to herself
that even if she did not understand still she could not doubt and at
any rate loved the governing synod and prayed for it

when he had finished the litany the deacon crossed the stole over his
breast and said let us commit ourselves and our whole lives to christ
the lord

commit ourselves to god natásha inwardly repeated lord god i
submit myself to thy will she thought i want nothing wish for
nothing teach me what to do and how to use my will take me take me
prayed natásha with impatient emotion in her heart not crossing
herself but letting her slender arms hang down as if expecting some
invisible power at any moment to take her and deliver her from herself
from her regrets desires remorse hopes and sins

the countess looked round several times at her daughters softened face
and shining eyes and prayed god to help her

unexpectedly in the middle of the service and not in the usual order
natásha knew so well the deacon brought out a small stool the one he
knelt on when praying on trinity sunday and placed it before the doors
of the sanctuary screen the priest came out with his purple velvet
biretta on his head adjusted his hair and knelt down with an effort
everybody followed his example and they looked at one another in
surprise then came the prayer just received from the synoda prayer for
the deliverance of russia from hostile invasion

lord god of might god of our salvation began the priest in that
voice clear not grandiloquent but mild in which only the slav clergy
read and which acts so irresistibly on a russian heart

lord god of might god of our salvation look this day in mercy and
blessing on thy humble people and graciously hear us spare us and
have mercy upon us this foe confounding thy land desiring to lay waste
the whole world rises against us these lawless men are gathered
together to overthrow thy kingdom to destroy thy dear jerusalem thy
beloved russia to defile thy temples to overthrow thine altars and to
desecrate our holy shrines how long o lord how long shall the wicked
triumph how long shall they wield unlawful power

lord god hear us when we pray to thee strengthen with thy might our
most gracious sovereign lord the emperor alexander pavlovich be
mindful of his uprightness and meekness reward him according to his
righteousness and let it preserve us thy chosen israel bless his
counsels his undertakings and his work strengthen his kingdom by
thine almighty hand and give him victory over his enemy even as thou
gavest moses the victory over amalek gideon over midian and david over
goliath preserve his army put a bow of brass in the hands of those who
have armed themselves in thy name and gird their loins with strength
for the fight take up the spear and shield and arise to help us
confound and put to shame those who have devised evil against us may
they be before the faces of thy faithful warriors as dust before the
wind and may thy mighty angel confound them and put them to flight may
they be ensnared when they know it not and may the plots they have laid
in secret be turned against them let them fall before thy servants
feet and be laid low by our hosts lord thou art able to save both
great and small thou art god and man cannot prevail against thee

god of our fathers remember thy bounteous mercy and lovingkindness
which are from of old turn not thy face from us but be gracious to our
unworthiness and in thy great goodness and thy many mercies regard not
our transgressions and iniquities create in us a clean heart and renew
a right spirit within us strengthen us all in thy faith fortify our
hope inspire us with true love one for another arm us with unity of
spirit in the righteous defense of the heritage thou gavest to us and to
our fathers and let not the scepter of the wicked be exalted against
the destiny of those thou hast sanctified

o lord our god in whom we believe and in whom we put our trust let us
not be confounded in our hope of thy mercy and give us a token of thy
blessing that those who hate us and our orthodox faith may see it and
be put to shame and perish and may all the nations know that thou art
the lord and we are thy people show thy mercy upon us this day o lord
and grant us thy salvation make the hearts of thy servants to rejoice
in thy mercy smite down our enemies and destroy them swiftly beneath
the feet of thy faithful servants for thou art the defense the succor
and the victory of them that put their trust in thee and to thee be all
glory to father son and holy ghost now and forever world without
end amen

in natáshas receptive condition of soul this prayer affected her
strongly she listened to every word about the victory of moses over
amalek of gideon over midian and of david over goliath and about the
destruction of thy jerusalem and she prayed to god with the
tenderness and emotion with which her heart was overflowing but without
fully understanding what she was asking of god in that prayer she
shared with all her heart in the prayer for the spirit of righteousness
for the strengthening of the heart by faith and hope and its animation
by love but she could not pray that her enemies might be trampled under
foot when but a few minutes before she had been wishing she had more of
them that she might pray for them but neither could she doubt the
righteousness of the prayer that was being read on bended knees she
felt in her heart a devout and tremulous awe at the thought of the
punishment that overtakes men for their sins and especially of her own
sins and she prayed to god to forgive them all and her too and to
give them all and her too peace and happiness and it seemed to her
that god heard her prayer





chapter xix

from the day when pierre after leaving the rostóvs with natáshas
grateful look fresh in his mind had gazed at the comet that seemed to
be fixed in the sky and felt that something new was appearing on his own
horizonfrom that day the problem of the vanity and uselessness of all
earthly things that had incessantly tormented him no longer presented
itself that terrible question why wherefore which had come to him
amid every occupation was now replaced not by another question or by a
reply to the former question but by her image when he listened to or
himself took part in trivial conversations when he read or heard of
human baseness or folly he was not horrified as formerly and did not
ask himself why men struggled so about these things when all is so
transient and incomprehensiblebut he remembered her as he had last seen
her and all his doubts vanishednot because she had answered the
questions that had haunted him but because his conception of her
transferred him instantly to another a brighter realm of spiritual
activity in which no one could be justified or guiltya realm of beauty
and love which it was worth living for whatever worldly baseness
presented itself to him he said to himself

well supposing n n swindled the country and the tsar and the
country and the tsar confer honors upon him what does that matter she
smiled at me yesterday and asked me to come again and i love her and
no one will ever know it and his soul felt calm and peaceful

pierre still went into society drank as much and led the same idle and
dissipated life because besides the hours he spent at the rostóvs
there were other hours he had to spend somehow and the habits and
acquaintances he had made in moscow formed a current that bore him along
irresistibly but latterly when more and more disquieting reports came
from the seat of war and natáshas health began to improve and she no
longer aroused in him the former feeling of careful pity an ever
increasing restlessness which he could not explain took possession of
him he felt that the condition he was in could not continue long that
a catastrophe was coming which would change his whole life and he
impatiently sought everywhere for signs of that approaching catastrophe
one of his brother masons had revealed to pierre the following prophecy
concerning napoleon drawn from the revelation of st john

in chapter  verse  of the apocalypse it is said

here is wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the
beast for it is the number of a man and his number is six hundred
threescore and six

and in the fifth verse of the same chapter

and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and
blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue forty and two
months

the french alphabet written out with the same numerical values as the
hebrew in which the first nine letters denote units and the others
tens will have the following significance

a   b   c   d   e   f   g   h   i   k
 l    m    n    o    p    q    r    s
 t    u    v    w    x    y            z

writing the words lempereur napoleon in numbers it appears that the
sum of them is  and that napoleon was therefore the beast foretold
in the apocalypse moreover by applying the same system to the words
quarantedeux  which was the term allowed to the beast that spoke
great things and blasphemies the same number  was obtained from
which it followed that the limit fixed for napoleons power had come in
the year  when the french emperor was fortytwo this prophecy
pleased pierre very much and he often asked himself what would put an
end to the power of the beast that is of napoleon and tried by the
same system of using letters as numbers and adding them up to find an
answer to the question that engrossed him he wrote the words lempereur
alexandre la nation russe and added up their numbers but the sums were
either more or less than  once when making such calculations he
wrote down his own name in french comte pierre besouhoff but the sum
of the numbers did not come right then he changed the spelling
substituting a z for the s and adding de and the article le still
without obtaining the desired result then it occurred to him if the
answer to the question were contained in his name his nationality would
also be given in the answer so he wrote le russe besuhof and adding up
the numbers got  this was only five too much and five was
represented by e the very letter elided from the article le before the
word empereur by omitting the e though incorrectly pierre got the
answer he sought lrusse besuhof made  this discovery excited him
how or by what means he was connected with the great event foretold in
the apocalypse he did not know but he did not doubt that connection for
a moment his love for natásha antichrist napoleon the invasion the
comet  lempereur napoleon and lrusse besuhofall this had to
mature and culminate to lift him out of that spellbound petty sphere
of moscow habits in which he felt himself held captive and lead him to a
great achievement and great happiness

 fortytwo

on the eve of the sunday when the special prayer was read pierre had
promised the rostóvs to bring them from count rostopchin whom he knew
well both the appeal to the people and the news from the army in the
morning when he went to call at rostopchins he met there a courier
fresh from the army an acquaintance of his own who often danced at
moscow balls

do please for heavens sake relieve me of something said the
courier i have a sackful of letters to parents

among these letters was one from nicholas rostóv to his father pierre
took that letter and rostopchin also gave him the emperors appeal to
moscow which had just been printed the last army orders and his own
most recent bulletin glancing through the army orders pierre found in
one of them in the lists of killed wounded and rewarded the name of
nicholas rostóv awarded a st georges cross of the fourth class for
courage shown in the ostrovna affair and in the same order the name of
prince andrew bolkónski appointed to the command of a regiment of
chasseurs though he did not want to remind the rostóvs of bolkónski
pierre could not refrain from making them happy by the news of their
sons having received a decoration so he sent that printed army order
and nicholas letter to the rostóvs keeping the appeal the bulletin
and the other orders to take with him when he went to dinner

his conversation with count rostopchin and the latters tone of anxious
hurry the meeting with the courier who talked casually of how badly
things were going in the army the rumors of the discovery of spies in
moscow and of a leaflet in circulation stating that napoleon promised to
be in both the russian capitals by the autumn and the talk of the
emperors being expected to arrive next dayall aroused with fresh force
that feeling of agitation and expectation in pierre which he had been
conscious of ever since the appearance of the comet and especially
since the beginning of the war

he had long been thinking of entering the army and would have done so
had he not been hindered first by his membership of the society of
freemasons to which he was bound by oath and which preached perpetual
peace and the abolition of war and secondly by the fact that when he
saw the great mass of muscovites who had donned uniform and were talking
patriotism he somehow felt ashamed to take the step but the chief
reason for not carrying out his intention to enter the army lay in the
vague idea that he was lrusse besuhof who had the number of the beast
 that his part in the great affair of setting a limit to the power
of the beast that spoke great and blasphemous things had been
predestined from eternity and that therefore he ought not to undertake
anything but wait for what was bound to come to pass





chapter xx

a few intimate friends were dining with the rostóvs that day as usual
on sundays

pierre came early so as to find them alone

he had grown so stout this year that he would have been abnormal had he
not been so tall so broad of limb and so strong that he carried his
bulk with evident ease

he went up the stairs puffing and muttering something his coachman did
not even ask whether he was to wait he knew that when his master was at
the rostóvs he stayed till midnight the rostóvs footman rushed
eagerly forward to help him off with his cloak and take his hat and
stick pierre from club habit always left both hat and stick in the
anteroom

the first person he saw in the house was natásha even before he saw
her while taking off his cloak he heard her she was practicing solfa
exercises in the music room he knew that she had not sung since her
illness and so the sound of her voice surprised and delighted him he
opened the door softly and saw her in the lilac dress she had worn at
church walking about the room singing she had her back to him when he
opened the door but when turning quickly she saw his broad surprised
face she blushed and came rapidly up to him

i want to try to sing again she said adding as if by way of excuse
it is at least something to do

thats capital

how glad i am youve come i am so happy today she said with the old
animation pierre had not seen in her for a long time you know nicholas
has received a st georges cross i am so proud of him

oh yes i sent that announcement but i dont want to interrupt you
he added and was about to go to the drawing room

natásha stopped him

count is it wrong of me to sing she said blushing and fixing her
eyes inquiringly on him

no why should it be on the contrary but why do you ask me

i dont know myself natásha answered quickly but i should not like
to do anything you disapproved of i believe in you completely you
dont know how important you are to me how much youve done for me
she spoke rapidly and did not notice how pierre flushed at her words i
saw in that same army order that he bolkónski she whispered the name
hastily is in russia and in the army again what do you thinkshe
was speaking hurriedly evidently afraid her strength might fail
herwill he ever forgive me will he not always have a bitter feeling
toward me what do you think what do you think

i think pierre replied that he has nothing to forgive if i
were in his place

by association of ideas pierre was at once carried back to the day
when trying to comfort her he had said that if he were not himself but
the best man in the world and free he would ask on his knees for her
hand and the same feeling of pity tenderness and love took possession
of him and the same words rose to his lips but she did not give him
time to say them

yes you you she said uttering the word you rapturouslythats
a different thing i know no one kinder more generous or better than
you nobody could be had you not been there then and now too i dont
know what would have become of me because

tears suddenly rose in her eyes she turned away lifted her music
before her eyes began singing again and again began walking up and
down the room

just then pétya came running in from the drawing room

pétya was now a handsome rosy lad of fifteen with full red lips and
resembled natásha he was preparing to enter the university but he and
his friend obolenski had lately in secret agreed to join the hussars

pétya had come rushing out to talk to his namesake about this affair he
had asked pierre to find out whether he would be accepted in the
hussars

pierre walked up and down the drawing room not listening to what pétya
was saying

pétya pulled him by the arm to attract his attention

well what about my plan peter kirilych for heavens sake you are my
only hope said pétya

oh yes your plan to join the hussars ill mention it ill bring it
all up today

well mon cher have you got the manifesto asked the old count the
countess has been to mass at the razumóvskis and heard the new prayer
she says its very fine

yes ive got it said pierre the emperor is to be here tomorrow
theres to be an extraordinary meeting of the nobility and they are
talking of a levy of ten men per thousand oh yes let me congratulate
you

yes yes thank god well and what news from the army

we are again retreating they say were already near smolensk replied
pierre

o lord o lord exclaimed the count where is the manifesto

the emperors appeal oh yes

pierre began feeling in his pockets for the papers but could not find
them still slapping his pockets he kissed the hand of the countess who
entered the room and glanced uneasily around evidently expecting
natásha who had left off singing but had not yet come into the drawing
room

on my word i dont know what ive done with it he said

there he is always losing everything remarked the countess

natásha entered with a softened and agitated expression of face and sat
down looking silently at pierre as soon as she entered pierres
features which had been gloomy suddenly lighted up and while still
searching for the papers he glanced at her several times

no really ill drive home i must have left them there ill
certainly

but youll be late for dinner

oh and my coachman has gone

but sónya who had gone to look for the papers in the anteroom had
found them in pierres hat where he had carefully tucked them under the
lining pierre was about to begin reading

no after dinner said the old count evidently expecting much
enjoyment from that reading

at dinner at which champagne was drunk to the health of the new
chevalier of st george shinshín told them the town news of the
illness of the old georgian princess of metiviers disappearance from
moscow and of how some german fellow had been brought to rostopchin and
accused of being a french spyer so count rostopchin had told the
story and how rostopchin let him go and assured the people that he was
not a spire at all but only an old german ruin

people are being arrested said the count ive told the countess
she should not speak french so much its not the time for it now

and have you heard shinshín asked prince golítsyn has engaged a
master to teach him russian it is becoming dangerous to speak french in
the streets

and how about you count peter kirilych if they call up the militia
you too will have to mount a horse remarked the old count addressing
pierre

pierre had been silent and preoccupied all through dinner seeming not
to grasp what was said he looked at the count

oh yes the war he said no what sort of warrior should i make and
yet everything is so strange so strange i cant make it out i dont
know i am very far from having military tastes but in these times no
one can answer for himself

after dinner the count settled himself comfortably in an easy chair and
with a serious face asked sónya who was considered an excellent reader
to read the appeal

to moscow our ancient capital

the enemy has entered the borders of russia with immense forces he
comes to despoil our beloved country

sónya read painstakingly in her highpitched voice the count listened
with closed eyes heaving abrupt sighs at certain passages

natásha sat erect gazing with a searching look now at her father and
now at pierre

pierre felt her eyes on him and tried not to look round the countess
shook her head disapprovingly and angrily at every solemn expression in
the manifesto in all these words she saw only that the danger
threatening her son would not soon be over shinshín with a sarcastic
smile on his lips was evidently preparing to make fun of anything that
gave him the opportunity sónyas reading any remark of the counts or
even the manifesto itself should no better pretext present itself

after reading about the dangers that threatened russia the hopes the
emperor placed on moscow and especially on its illustrious nobility
sónya with a quiver in her voice due chiefly to the attention that was
being paid to her read the last words

we ourselves will not delay to appear among our people in that capital
and in other parts of our realm for consultation and for the direction
of all our levies both those now barring the enemys path and those
freshly formed to defeat him wherever he may appear may the ruin he
hopes to bring upon us recoil on his own head and may europe delivered
from bondage glorify the name of russia

yes thats it cried the count opening his moist eyes and sniffing
repeatedly as if a strong vinaigrette had been held to his nose and he
added let the emperor but say the word and well sacrifice everything
and begrudge nothing

before shinshín had time to utter the joke he was ready to make on the
counts patriotism natásha jumped up from her place and ran to her
father

what a darling our papa is she cried kissing him and she again
looked at pierre with the unconscious coquetry that had returned to her
with her better spirits

there heres a patriot for you said shinshín

not a patriot at all but simply natásha replied in an injured
tone everything seems funny to you but this isnt at all a joke

a joke indeed put in the count let him but say the word and well
all go were not germans

but did you notice it says for consultation said pierre

never mind what its for

at this moment pétya to whom nobody was paying any attention came up
to his father with a very flushed face and said in his breaking voice
that was now deep and now shrill

well papa i tell you definitely and mamma too its as you please
but i say definitely that you must let me enter the army because i
cant thats all

the countess in dismay looked up to heaven clasped her hands and
turned angrily to her husband

that comes of your talking said she

but the count had already recovered from his excitement

come come said he heres a fine warrior no nonsense you must
study

its not nonsense papa fedya obolenski is younger than i and hes
going too besides all the same i cant study now when pétya
stopped short flushed till he perspired but still got out the words
when our fatherland is in danger

thatll do thatll dononsense

but you said yourself that we would sacrifice everything

pétya be quiet i tell you cried the count with a glance at his
wife who had turned pale and was staring fixedly at her son

and i tell youpeter kirilych here will also tell you

nonsense i tell you your mothers milk has hardly dried on your lips
and you want to go into the army there there i tell you and the
count moved to go out of the room taking the papers probably to reread
them in his study before having a nap

well peter kirilych lets go and have a smoke he said

pierre was agitated and undecided natáshas unwontedly brilliant eyes
continually glancing at him with a more than cordial look had reduced
him to this condition

no i think ill go home

home why you meant to spend the evening with us you dont often
come nowadays as it is and this girl of mine said the count good
naturedly pointing to natásha only brightens up when youre here

yes i had forgotten i really must go home business said
pierre hurriedly

well then au revoir said the count and went out of the room

why are you going why are you upset asked natásha and she looked
challengingly into pierres eyes

because i love you was what he wanted to say but he did not say it
and only blushed till the tears came and lowered his eyes

because it is better for me to come less often because no simply
i have business

why no tell me natásha began resolutely and suddenly stopped

they looked at each other with dismayed and embarrassed faces he tried
to smile but could not his smile expressed suffering and he silently
kissed her hand and went out

pierre made up his mind not to go to the rostóvs any more





chapter xxi

after the definite refusal he had received pétya went to his room and
there locked himself in and wept bitterly when he came in to tea
silent morose and with tearstained face everybody pretended not to
notice anything

next day the emperor arrived in moscow and several of the rostóvs
domestic serfs begged permission to go to have a look at him that
morning pétya was a long time dressing and arranging his hair and collar
to look like a grownup man he frowned before his looking glass
gesticulated shrugged his shoulders and finally without saying a word
to anyone took his cap and left the house by the back door trying to
avoid notice pétya decided to go straight to where the emperor was and
to explain frankly to some gentlemaninwaiting he imagined the emperor
to be always surrounded by gentlemeninwaiting that he count rostóv
in spite of his youth wished to serve his country that youth could be
no hindrance to loyalty and that he was ready to while dressing
pétya had prepared many fine things he meant to say to the gentlemanin
waiting

it was on the very fact of being so young that pétya counted for success
in reaching the emperorhe even thought how surprised everyone would be
at his youthfulnessand yet in the arrangement of his collar and hair
and by his sedate deliberate walk he wished to appear a grownup man
but the farther he went and the more his attention was diverted by the
everincreasing crowds moving toward the kremlin the less he remembered
to walk with the sedateness and deliberation of a man as he approached
the kremlin he even began to avoid being crushed and resolutely stuck
out his elbows in a menacing way but within the trinity gateway he was
so pressed to the wall by people who probably were unaware of the
patriotic intentions with which he had come that in spite of all his
determination he had to give in and stop while carriages passed in
rumbling beneath the archway beside pétya stood a peasant woman a
footman two tradesmen and a discharged soldier after standing some
time in the gateway pétya tried to move forward in front of the others
without waiting for all the carriages to pass and he began resolutely
working his way with his elbows but the woman just in front of him who
was the first against whom he directed his efforts angrily shouted at
him

what are you shoving for young lordling dont you see were all
standing still then why push

anybody can shove said the footman and also began working his elbows
to such effect that he pushed pétya into a very filthy corner of the
gateway

pétya wiped his perspiring face with his hands and pulled up the damp
collar which he had arranged so well at home to seem like a mans

he felt that he no longer looked presentable and feared that if he were
now to approach the gentlemeninwaiting in that plight he would not be
admitted to the emperor but it was impossible to smarten oneself up or
move to another place because of the crowd one of the generals who
drove past was an acquaintance of the rostóvs and pétya thought of
asking his help but came to the conclusion that that would not be a
manly thing to do when the carriages had all passed in the crowd
carrying pétya with it streamed forward into the kremlin square which
was already full of people there were people not only in the square
but everywhereon the slopes and on the roofs as soon as pétya found
himself in the square he clearly heard the sound of bells and the joyous
voices of the crowd that filled the whole kremlin

for a while the crowd was less dense but suddenly all heads were bared
and everyone rushed forward in one direction pétya was being pressed so
that he could scarcely breathe and everybody shouted hurrah hurrah
hurrah pétya stood on tiptoe and pushed and pinched but could see
nothing except the people about him

all the faces bore the same expression of excitement and enthusiasm a
tradesmans wife standing beside pétya sobbed and the tears ran down
her cheeks

father angel dear one she kept repeating wiping away her tears
with her fingers

hurrah was heard on all sides

for a moment the crowd stood still but then it made another rush
forward

quite beside himself pétya clinching his teeth and rolling his eyes
ferociously pushed forward elbowing his way and shouting hurrah as
if he were prepared that instant to kill himself and everyone else but
on both sides of him other people with similarly ferocious faces pushed
forward and everybody shouted hurrah

so this is what the emperor is thought pétya no i cant petition
him myselfthat would be too bold but in spite of this he continued to
struggle desperately forward and from between the backs of those in
front he caught glimpses of an open space with a strip of red cloth
spread out on it but just then the crowd swayed backthe police in
front were pushing back those who had pressed too close to the
procession the emperor was passing from the palace to the cathedral of
the assumptionand pétya unexpectedly received such a blow on his side
and ribs and was squeezed so hard that suddenly everything grew dim
before his eyes and he lost consciousness when he came to himself a
man of clerical appearance with a tuft of gray hair at the back of his
head and wearing a shabby blue cassockprobably a church clerk and
chanterwas holding him under the arm with one hand while warding off
the pressure of the crowd with the other

youve crushed the young gentleman said the clerk what are you up
to gently theyve crushed him crushed him

the emperor entered the cathedral of the assumption the crowd spread
out again more evenly and the clerk led pétyapale and breathlessto
the tsarcannon several people were sorry for pétya and suddenly a
crowd turned toward him and pressed round him those who stood nearest
him attended to him unbuttoned his coat seated him on the raised
platform of the cannon and reproached those others whoever they might
be who had crushed him

one might easily get killed that way what do they mean by it killing
people poor dear hes as white as a sheetvarious voices were heard
saying

pétya soon came to himself the color returned to his face the pain had
passed and at the cost of that temporary unpleasantness he had obtained
a place by the cannon from where he hoped to see the emperor who would
be returning that way pétya no longer thought of presenting his
petition if he could only see the emperor he would be happy

while the service was proceeding in the cathedral of the assumptionit
was a combined service of prayer on the occasion of the emperors
arrival and of thanksgiving for the conclusion of peace with the
turksthe crowd outside spread out and hawkers appeared selling kvas
gingerbread and poppyseed sweets of which pétya was particularly
fond and ordinary conversation could again be heard a tradesmans
wife was showing a rent in her shawl and telling how much the shawl had
cost another was saying that all silk goods had now got dear the clerk
who had rescued pétya was talking to a functionary about the priests who
were officiating that day with the bishop the clerk several times used
the word plenary of the service a word pétya did not understand
two young citizens were joking with some serf girls who were cracking
nuts all these conversations especially the joking with the girls
were such as might have had a particular charm for pétya at his age but
they did not interest him now he sat on his elevationthe pedestal of
the cannonstill agitated as before by the thought of the emperor and by
his love for him the feeling of pain and fear he had experienced when
he was being crushed together with that of rapture still further
intensified his sense of the importance of the occasion

suddenly the sound of a firing of cannon was heard from the embankment
to celebrate the signing of peace with the turks and the crowd rushed
impetuously toward the embankment to watch the firing pétya too would
have run there but the clerk who had taken the young gentleman under
his protection stopped him the firing was still proceeding when
officers generals and gentlemeninwaiting came running out of the
cathedral and after them others in a more leisurely manner caps were
again raised and those who had run to look at the cannon ran back
again at last four men in uniforms and sashes emerged from the
cathedral doors hurrah hurrah shouted the crowd again

which is he which asked pétya in a tearful voice of those around
him but no one answered him everybody was too excited and pétya
fixing on one of those four men whom he could not clearly see for the
tears of joy that filled his eyes concentrated all his enthusiasm on
himthough it happened not to be the emperorfrantically shouted
hurrah and resolved that tomorrow come what might he would join the
army

the crowd ran after the emperor followed him to the palace and began
to disperse it was already late and pétya had not eaten anything and
was drenched with perspiration yet he did not go home but stood with
that diminishing but still considerable crowd before the palace while
the emperor dinedlooking in at the palace windows expecting he knew
not what and envying alike the notables he saw arriving at the entrance
to dine with the emperor and the court footmen who served at table
glimpses of whom could be seen through the windows

while the emperor was dining valuev looking out of the window said

the people are still hoping to see your majesty again

the dinner was nearly over and the emperor munching a biscuit rose
and went out onto the balcony the people with pétya among them rushed
toward the balcony

angel dear one hurrah father cried the crowd and pétya with
it and again the women and men of weaker mold pétya among them wept
with joy

a largish piece of the biscuit the emperor was holding in his hand broke
off fell on the balcony parapet and then to the ground a coachman in
a jerkin who stood nearest sprang forward and snatched it up several
people in the crowd rushed at the coachman seeing this the emperor had
a plateful of biscuits brought him and began throwing them down from the
balcony pétyas eyes grew bloodshot and still more excited by the
danger of being crushed he rushed at the biscuits he did not know why
but he had to have a biscuit from the tsars hand and he felt that he
must not give way he sprang forward and upset an old woman who was
catching at a biscuit the old woman did not consider herself defeated
though she was lying on the groundshe grabbed at some biscuits but her
hand did not reach them pétya pushed her hand away with his knee
seized a biscuit and as if fearing to be too late again shouted
hurrah with a voice already hoarse

the emperor went in and after that the greater part of the crowd began
to disperse

there i said if only we waitedand so it was was being joyfully said
by various people

happy as pétya was he felt sad at having to go home knowing that all
the enjoyment of that day was over he did not go straight home from the
kremlin but called on his friend obolenski who was fifteen and was
also entering the regiment on returning home pétya announced resolutely
and firmly that if he was not allowed to enter the service he would run
away and next day count ilyá rostóvthough he had not yet quite
yieldedwent to inquire how he could arrange for pétya to serve where
there would be least danger





chapter xxii

two days later on the fifteenth of july an immense number of carriages
were standing outside the sloboda palace

the great halls were full in the first were the nobility and gentry in
their uniforms in the second bearded merchants in fullskirted coats of
blue cloth and wearing medals in the noblemens hall there was an
incessant movement and buzz of voices the chief magnates sat on high
backed chairs at a large table under the portrait of the emperor but
most of the gentry were strolling about the room

all these nobles whom pierre met every day at the club or in their own
houses were in uniformsome in that of catherines day others in that
of emperor paul others again in the new uniforms of alexanders time or
the ordinary uniform of the nobility and the general characteristic of
being in uniform imparted something strange and fantastic to these
diverse and familiar personalities both old and young the old men
dimeyed toothless bald sallow and bloated or gaunt and wrinkled
were especially striking for the most part they sat quietly in their
places and were silent or if they walked about and talked attached
themselves to someone younger on all these faces as on the faces of
the crowd pétya had seen in the square there was a striking
contradiction the general expectation of a solemn event and at the
same time the everyday interests in a boston card party peter the cook
zinaida dmítrievnas health and so on

pierre was there too buttoned up since early morning in a noblemans
uniform that had become too tight for him he was agitated this
extraordinary gathering not only of nobles but also of the merchant
classles etats generaux statesgeneralevoked in him a whole series
of ideas he had long laid aside but which were deeply graven in his
soul thoughts of the contrat social and the french revolution the
words that had struck him in the emperors appealthat the sovereign was
coming to the capital for consultation with his peoplestrengthened this
idea and imagining that in this direction something important which he
had long awaited was drawing near he strolled about watching and
listening to conversations but nowhere finding any confirmation of the
ideas that occupied him

the emperors manifesto was read evoking enthusiasm and then all moved
about discussing it besides the ordinary topics of conversation pierre
heard questions of where the marshals of the nobility were to stand when
the emperor entered when a ball should be given in the emperors honor
whether they should group themselves by districts or by whole
provinces and so on but as soon as the war was touched on or what
the nobility had been convened for the talk became undecided and
indefinite then all preferred listening to speaking

a middleaged man handsome and virile in the uniform of a retired
naval officer was speaking in one of the rooms and a small crowd was
pressing round him pierre went up to the circle that had formed round
the speaker and listened count ilyá rostóv in a military uniform of
catherines time was sauntering with a pleasant smile among the crowd
with all of whom he was acquainted he too approached that group and
listened with a kindly smile and nods of approval as he always did to
what the speaker was saying the retired naval man was speaking very
boldly as was evident from the expression on the faces of the listeners
and from the fact that some people pierre knew as the meekest and
quietest of men walked away disapprovingly or expressed disagreement
with him pierre pushed his way into the middle of the group listened
and convinced himself that the man was indeed a liberal but of views
quite different from his own the naval officer spoke in a particularly
sonorous musical and aristocratic baritone voice pleasantly
swallowing his rs and generally slurring his consonants the voice of a
man calling out to his servant heah bwing me my pipe it was
indicative of dissipation and the exercise of authority

what if the smolensk people have offahd to waise militia for the
empewah ah we to take smolensk as our patten if the noble awistocwacy
of the pwovince of moscow thinks fit it can show its loyalty to our
sovweign the empewah in other ways have we fogotten the waising of
the militia in the yeah seven all that did was to enwich the pwiests
sons and thieves and wobbahs

count ilyá rostóv smiled blandly and nodded approval

and was our militia of any use to the empia not at all it only wuined
our farming bettah have another conscwiption o ou men will wetun
neithah soldiers no peasants and well get only depwavity fwom them
the nobility dont gwudge theah livesevewy one of us will go and bwing
in more wecwuits and the sovweign that was the way he referred to
the emperor need only say the word and well all die fo him added
the orator with animation

count rostóvs mouth watered with pleasure and he nudged pierre but
pierre wanted to speak himself he pushed forward feeling stirred but
not yet sure what stirred him or what he would say scarcely had he
opened his mouth when one of the senators a man without a tooth in his
head with a shrewd though angry expression standing near the first
speaker interrupted him evidently accustomed to managing debates and
to maintaining an argument he began in low but distinct tones

i imagine sir said he mumbling with his toothless mouth that we
have been summoned here not to discuss whether its best for the empire
at the present moment to adopt conscription or to call out the militia
we have been summoned to reply to the appeal with which our sovereign
the emperor has honored us but to judge what is bestconscription or
the militiawe can leave to the supreme authority

pierre suddenly saw an outlet for his excitement he hardened his heart
against the senator who was introducing this set and narrow attitude
into the deliberations of the nobility pierre stepped forward and
interrupted him he himself did not yet know what he would say but he
began to speak eagerly occasionally lapsing into french or expressing
himself in bookish russian

excuse me your excellency he began he was well acquainted with the
senator but thought it necessary on this occasion to address him
formally though i dont agree with the gentleman he hesitated
he wished to say mon tres honorable preopinantmy very honorable
opponent with the gentleman whom i have not the honor of knowing
i suppose that the nobility have been summoned not merely to express
their sympathy and enthusiasm but also to consider the means by which we
can assist our fatherland i imagine he went on warming to his
subject that the emperor himself would not be satisfied to find in us
merely owners of serfs whom we are willing to devote to his service and
chair a canon  we are ready to make of ourselvesand not to obtain from
us any cococounsel

 food for cannon

many persons withdrew from the circle noticing the senators sarcastic
smile and the freedom of pierres remarks only count rostóv was pleased
with them as he had been pleased with those of the naval officer the
senator and in general with whatever speech he had last heard

i think that before discussing these questions pierre continued we
should ask the emperormost respectfully ask his majestyto let us know
the number of our troops and the position in which our army and our
forces now are and then

but scarcely had pierre uttered these words before he was attacked from
three sides the most vigorous attack came from an old acquaintance a
boston player who had always been well disposed toward him stepan
stepanovich adraksin adraksin was in uniform and whether as a result
of the uniform or from some other cause pierre saw before him quite a
different man with a sudden expression of malevolence on his aged face
adraksin shouted at pierre

in the first place i tell you we have no right to question the emperor
about that and secondly if the russian nobility had that right the
emperor could not answer such a question the troops are moved according
to the enemys movements and the number of men increases and
decreases

another voice that of a nobleman of medium height and about forty years
of age whom pierre had formerly met at the gypsies and knew as a bad
cardplayer and who also transformed by his uniform came up to pierre
interrupted adraksin

yes and this is not a time for discussing he continued but for
acting there is war in russia the enemy is advancing to destroy
russia to desecrate the tombs of our fathers to carry off our wives
and children the nobleman smote his breast we will all arise
everyone of us will go for our father the tsar he shouted rolling
his bloodshot eyes several approving voices were heard in the crowd
we are russians and will not grudge our blood in defense of our faith
the throne and the fatherland we must cease raving if we are sons of
our fatherland we will show europe how russia rises to the defense of
russia

pierre wished to reply but could not get in a word he felt that his
words apart from what meaning they conveyed were less audible than the
sound of his opponents voice

count rostóv at the back of the crowd was expressing approval several
persons briskly turning a shoulder to the orator at the end of a
phrase said

thats right quite right just so

pierre wished to say that he was ready to sacrifice his money his
serfs or himself only one ought to know the state of affairs in order
to be able to improve it but he was unable to speak many voices
shouted and talked at the same time so that count rostóv had not time
to signify his approval of them all and the group increased dispersed
reformed and then moved with a hum of talk into the largest hall and
to the big table not only was pierres attempt to speak unsuccessful
but he was rudely interrupted pushed aside and people turned away from
him as from a common enemy this happened not because they were
displeased by the substance of his speech which had even been forgotten
after the many subsequent speeches but to animate it the crowd needed a
tangible object to love and a tangible object to hate pierre became the
latter many other orators spoke after the excited nobleman and all in
the same tone many spoke eloquently and with originality

glinka the editor of the russian messenger who was recognized cries
of author author were heard in the crowd said that hell must be
repulsed by hell and that he had seen a child smiling at lightning
flashes and thunderclaps but we will not be that child

yes yes at thunderclaps was repeated approvingly in the back rows
of the crowd

the crowd drew up to the large table at which sat grayhaired or bald
seventyyearold magnates uniformed and besashed almost all of whom
pierre had seen in their own homes with their buffoons or playing
boston at the clubs with an incessant hum of voices the crowd advanced
to the table pressed by the throng against the high backs of the
chairs the orators spoke one after another and sometimes two together
those standing behind noticed what a speaker omitted to say and hastened
to supply it others in that heat and crush racked their brains to find
some thought and hastened to utter it the old magnates whom pierre
knew sat and turned to look first at one and then at another and their
faces for the most part only expressed the fact that they found it very
hot pierre however felt excited and the general desire to show that
they were ready to go to all lengthswhich found expression in the tones
and looks more than in the substance of the speechesinfected him too
he did not renounce his opinions but felt himself in some way to blame
and wished to justify himself

i only said that it would be more to the purpose to make sacrifices
when we know what is needed said he trying to be heard above the
other voices

one of the old men nearest to him looked round but his attention was
immediately diverted by an exclamation at the other side of the table

yes moscow will be surrendered she will be our expiation shouted
one man

he is the enemy of mankind cried another allow me to speak
gentlemen you are crushing me





chapter xxiii

at that moment count rostopchin with his protruding chin and alert eyes
wearing the uniform of a general with sash over his shoulder entered
the room stepping briskly to the front of the crowd of gentry

our sovereign the emperor will be here in a moment said rostopchin
i am straight from the palace seeing the position we are in i think
there is little need for discussion the emperor has deigned to summon
us and the merchants millions will pour forth from therehe pointed to
the merchants hallbut our business is to supply men and not spare
ourselves that is the least we can do

a conference took place confined to the magnates sitting at the table
the whole consultation passed more than quietly after all the preceding
noise the sound of their old voices saying one after another i agree
or for variety i too am of that opinion and so on had even a
mournful effect

the secretary was told to write down the resolution of the moscow
nobility and gentry that they would furnish ten men fully equipped
out of every thousand serfs as the smolensk gentry had done their
chairs made a scraping noise as the gentlemen who had conferred rose
with apparent relief and began walking up and down arm in arm to
stretch their legs and converse in couples

the emperor the emperor a sudden cry resounded through the halls and
the whole throng hurried to the entrance

the emperor entered the hall through a broad path between two lines of
nobles every face expressed respectful awestruck curiosity pierre
stood rather far off and could not hear all that the emperor said from
what he did hear he understood that the emperor spoke of the danger
threatening the empire and of the hopes he placed on the moscow
nobility he was answered by a voice which informed him of the
resolution just arrived at

gentlemen said the emperor with a quivering voice

there was a rustling among the crowd and it again subsided so that
pierre distinctly heard the pleasantly human voice of the emperor saying
with emotion

i never doubted the devotion of the russian nobles but today it has
surpassed my expectations i thank you in the name of the fatherland
gentlemen let us act time is most precious

the emperor ceased speaking the crowd began pressing round him and
rapturous exclamations were heard from all sides

yes most precious a royal word said count rostóv with a sob he
stood at the back and though he had heard hardly anything understood
everything in his own way

from the hall of the nobility the emperor went to that of the merchants
there he remained about ten minutes pierre was among those who saw him
come out from the merchants hall with tears of emotion in his eyes as
became known later he had scarcely begun to address the merchants
before tears gushed from his eyes and he concluded in a trembling voice
when pierre saw the emperor he was coming out accompanied by two
merchants one of whom pierre knew a fat otkupshchik the other was the
mayor a man with a thin sallow face and narrow beard both were
weeping tears filled the thin mans eyes and the fat otkupshchik
sobbed outright like a child and kept repeating

our lives and propertytake them your majesty

pierres one feeling at the moment was a desire to show that he was
ready to go all lengths and was prepared to sacrifice everything he now
felt ashamed of his speech with its constitutional tendency and sought
an opportunity of effacing it having heard that count mamonov was
furnishing a regiment bezúkhov at once informed rostopchin that he
would give a thousand men and their maintenance

old rostóv could not tell his wife of what had passed without tears and
at once consented to pétyas request and went himself to enter his name

next day the emperor left moscow the assembled nobles all took off
their uniforms and settled down again in their homes and clubs and not
without some groans gave orders to their stewards about the enrollment
feeling amazed themselves at what they had done





book ten





chapter i

napoleon began the war with russia because he could not resist going to
dresden could not help having his head turned by the homage he
received could not help donning a polish uniform and yielding to the
stimulating influence of a june morning and could not refrain from
bursts of anger in the presence of kurakin and then of balashev

alexander refused negotiations because he felt himself to be personally
insulted barclay de tolly tried to command the army in the best way
because he wished to fulfill his duty and earn fame as a great
commander rostóv charged the french because he could not restrain his
wish for a gallop across a level field and in the same way the
innumerable people who took part in the war acted in accord with their
personal characteristics habits circumstances and aims they were
moved by fear or vanity rejoiced or were indignant reasoned imagining
that they knew what they were doing and did it of their own free will
but they all were involuntary tools of history carrying on a work
concealed from them but comprehensible to us such is the inevitable
fate of men of action and the higher they stand in the social hierarchy
the less are they free

the actors of  have long since left the stage their personal
interests have vanished leaving no trace and nothing remains of that
time but its historic results

providence compelled all these men striving to attain personal aims to
further the accomplishment of a stupendous result no one of them at all
expectedneither napoleon nor alexander nor still less any of those
who did the actual fighting

the cause of the destruction of the french army in  is clear to us
now no one will deny that that cause was on the one hand its advance
into the heart of russia late in the season without any preparation for
a winter campaign and on the other the character given to the war by
the burning of russian towns and the hatred of the foe this aroused
among the russian people but no one at the time foresaw what now seems
so evident that this was the only way an army of eight hundred thousand
menthe best in the world and led by the best generalcould be destroyed
in conflict with a raw army of half its numerical strength and led by
inexperienced commanders as the russian army was not only did no one
see this but on the russian side every effort was made to hinder the
only thing that could save russia while on the french side despite
napoleons experience and socalled military genius every effort was
directed to pushing on to moscow at the end of the summer that is to
doing the very thing that was bound to lead to destruction

in historical works on the year  french writers are very fond of
saying that napoleon felt the danger of extending his line that he
sought a battle and that his marshals advised him to stop at smolensk
and of making similar statements to show that the danger of the campaign
was even then understood russian authors are still fonder of telling us
that from the commencement of the campaign a scythian war plan was
adopted to lure napoleon into the depths of russia and this plan some
of them attribute to pfuel others to a certain frenchman others to
toll and others again to alexander himselfpointing to notes projects
and letters which contain hints of such a line of action but all these
hints at what happened both from the french side and the russian are
advanced only because they fit in with the event had that event not
occurred these hints would have been forgotten as we have forgotten the
thousands and millions of hints and expectations to the contrary which
were current then but have now been forgotten because the event
falsified them there are always so many conjectures as to the issue of
any event that however it may end there will always be people to say i
said then that it would be so quite forgetting that amid their
innumerable conjectures many were to quite the contrary effect

conjectures as to napoleons awareness of the danger of extending his
line and on the russian side as to luring the enemy into the depths
of russia are evidently of that kind and only by much straining can
historians attribute such conceptions to napoleon and his marshals or
such plans to the russian commanders all the facts are in flat
contradiction to such conjectures during the whole period of the war
not only was there no wish on the russian side to draw the french into
the heart of the country but from their first entry into russia
everything was done to stop them and not only was napoleon not afraid
to extend his line but he welcomed every step forward as a triumph and
did not seek battle as eagerly as in former campaigns but very lazily

at the very beginning of the war our armies were divided and our sole
aim was to unite them though uniting the armies was no advantage if we
meant to retire and lure the enemy into the depths of the country our
emperor joined the army to encourage it to defend every inch of russian
soil and not to retreat the enormous drissa camp was formed on pfuels
plan and there was no intention of retiring farther the emperor
reproached the commanders in chief for every step they retired he could
not bear the idea of letting the enemy even reach smolensk still less
could he contemplate the burning of moscow and when our armies did
unite he was displeased that smolensk was abandoned and burned without a
general engagement having been fought under its walls

so thought the emperor and the russian commanders and people were still
more provoked at the thought that our forces were retreating into the
depths of the country

napoleon having cut our armies apart advanced far into the country and
missed several chances of forcing an engagement in august he was at
smolensk and thought only of how to advance farther though as we now
see that advance was evidently ruinous to him

the facts clearly show that napoleon did not foresee the danger of the
advance on moscow nor did alexander and the russian commanders then
think of luring napoleon on but quite the contrary the luring of
napoleon into the depths of the country was not the result of any plan
for no one believed it to be possible it resulted from a most complex
interplay of intrigues aims and wishes among those who took part in
the war and had no perception whatever of the inevitable or of the one
way of saving russia everything came about fortuitously the armies
were divided at the commencement of the campaign we tried to unite
them with the evident intention of giving battle and checking the
enemys advance and by this effort to unite them while avoiding battle
with a much stronger enemy and necessarily withdrawing the armies at an
acute anglewe led the french on to smolensk but we withdrew at an
acute angle not only because the french advanced between our two armies
the angle became still more acute and we withdrew still farther because
barclay de tolly was an unpopular foreigner disliked by bagration who
would come under his command and bagrationbeing in command of the
second armytried to postpone joining up and coming under barclays
command as long as he could bagration was slow in effecting the
junctionthough that was the chief aim of all at headquartersbecause
as he alleged he exposed his army to danger on this march and it was
best for him to retire more to the left and more to the south worrying
the enemy from flank and rear and securing from the ukraine recruits for
his army and it looks as if he planned this in order not to come under
the command of the detested foreigner barclay whose rank was inferior
to his own

the emperor was with the army to encourage it but his presence and
ignorance of what steps to take and the enormous number of advisers and
plans destroyed the first armys energy and it retired

the intention was to make a stand at the drissa camp but paulucci
aiming at becoming commanderinchief unexpectedly employed his energy
to influence alexander and pfuels whole plan was abandoned and the
command entrusted to barclay but as barclay did not inspire confidence
his power was limited the armies were divided there was no unity of
command and barclay was unpopular but from this confusion division
and the unpopularity of the foreign commanderinchief there resulted
on the one hand indecision and the avoidance of a battle which we could
not have refrained from had the armies been united and had someone else
instead of barclay been in command and on the other an everincreasing
indignation against the foreigners and an increase in patriotic zeal

at last the emperor left the army and as the most convenient and indeed
the only pretext for his departure it was decided that it was necessary
for him to inspire the people in the capitals and arouse the nation in
general to a patriotic war and by this visit of the emperor to moscow
the strength of the russian army was trebled

he left in order not to obstruct the commanderinchiefs undivided
control of the army and hoping that more decisive action would then be
taken but the command of the armies became still more confused and
enfeebled bennigsen the tsarevich and a swarm of adjutants general
remained with the army to keep the commanderinchief under observation
and arouse his energy and barclay feeling less free than ever under
the observation of all these eyes of the emperor became still more
cautious of undertaking any decisive action and avoided giving battle

barclay stood for caution the tsarevich hinted at treachery and
demanded a general engagement lubomirski bronnitski wlocki and the
others of that group stirred up so much trouble that barclay under
pretext of sending papers to the emperor dispatched these polish
adjutants general to petersburg and plunged into an open struggle with
bennigsen and the tsarevich

at smolensk the armies at last reunited much as bagration disliked it

bagration drove up in a carriage to the house occupied by barclay
barclay donned his sash and came out to meet and report to his senior
officer bagration

despite his seniority in rank bagration in this contest of magnanimity
took his orders from barclay but having submitted agreed with him
less than ever by the emperors orders bagration reported direct to
him he wrote to arakcheev the emperors confidant it must be as my
sovereign pleases but i cannot work with the minister meaning
barclay for gods sake send me somewhere else if only in command of a
regiment i cannot stand it here headquarters are so full of germans
that a russian cannot exist and there is no sense in anything i thought
i was really serving my sovereign and the fatherland but it turns out
that i am serving barclay i confess i do not want to

the swarm of bronnitskis and wintzingerodes and their like still further
embittered the relations between the commanders in chief and even less
unity resulted preparations were made to fight the french before
smolensk a general was sent to survey the position this general
hating barclay rode to visit a friend of his own a corps commander
and having spent the day with him returned to barclay and condemned
as unsuitable from every point of view the battleground he had not
seen

while disputes and intrigues were going on about the future field of
battle and while we were looking for the frenchhaving lost touch with
themthe french stumbled upon neverovskis division and reached the
walls of smolensk

it was necessary to fight an unexpected battle at smolensk to save our
lines of communication the battle was fought and thousands were killed
on both sides

smolensk was abandoned contrary to the wishes of the emperor and of the
whole people but smolensk was burned by its own inhabitantswho had
been misled by their governor and these ruined inhabitants setting an
example to other russians went to moscow thinking only of their own
losses but kindling hatred of the foe napoleon advanced farther and we
retired thus arriving at the very result which caused his destruction





chapter ii

the day after his son had left prince nicholas sent for princess mary
to come to his study

well are you satisfied now said he youve made me quarrel with my
son satisfied are you thats all you wanted satisfied it hurts
me it hurts im old and weak and this is what you wanted well then
gloat over it gloat over it

after that princess mary did not see her father for a whole week he was
ill and did not leave his study

princess mary noticed to her surprise that during this illness the old
prince not only excluded her from his room but did not admit
mademoiselle bourienne either tíkhon alone attended him

at the end of the week the prince reappeared and resumed his former way
of life devoting himself with special activity to building operations
and the arrangement of the gardens and completely breaking off his
relations with mademoiselle bourienne his looks and cold tone to his
daughter seemed to say there you see you plotted against me you
lied to prince andrew about my relations with that frenchwoman and made
me quarrel with him but you see i need neither her nor you

princess mary spent half of every day with little nicholas watching his
lessons teaching him russian and music herself and talking to
dessalles the rest of the day she spent over her books with her old
nurse or with gods folk who sometimes came by the back door to see
her

of the war princess mary thought as women do think about wars she
feared for her brother who was in it was horrified by and amazed at the
strange cruelty that impels men to kill one another but she did not
understand the significance of this war which seemed to her like all
previous wars she did not realize the significance of this war though
dessalles with whom she constantly conversed was passionately interested
in its progress and tried to explain his own conception of it to her
and though the gods folk who came to see her reported in their own
way the rumors current among the people of an invasion by antichrist
and though julie now princess drubetskáya who had resumed
correspondence with her wrote patriotic letters from moscow

i write you in russian my good friend wrote julie in her frenchified
russian because i have a detestation for all the french and the same
for their language which i cannot support to hear spoken we in
moscow are elated by enthusiasm for our adored emperor

my poor husband is enduring pains and hunger in jewish taverns but the
news which i have inspires me yet more

you heard probably of the heroic exploit of raevski embracing his two
sons and saying i will perish with them but we will not be shaken
and truly though the enemy was twice stronger than we we were
unshakable we pass the time as we can but in war as in war the
princesses aline and sophie sit whole days with me and we unhappy
widows of live men make beautiful conversations over our charpie
only you my friend are missing and so on

the chief reason princess mary did not realize the full significance of
this war was that the old prince never spoke of it did not recognize
it and laughed at dessalles when he mentioned it at dinner the
princes tone was so calm and confident that princess mary
unhesitatingly believed him

all that july the old prince was exceedingly active and even animated
he planned another garden and began a new building for the domestic
serfs the only thing that made princess mary anxious about him was that
he slept very little and instead of sleeping in his study as usual
changed his sleeping place every day one day he would order his camp
bed to be set up in the glass gallery another day he remained on the
couch or on the lounge chair in the drawing room and dozed there without
undressing whileinstead of mademoiselle bouriennea serf boy read to
him then again he would spend a night in the dining room

on august  a second letter was received from prince andrew in his
first letter which came soon after he had left home prince andrew had
dutifully asked his fathers forgiveness for what he had allowed himself
to say and begged to be restored to his favor to this letter the old
prince had replied affectionately and from that time had kept the
frenchwoman at a distance prince andrews second letter written near
vitebsk after the french had occupied that town gave a brief account of
the whole campaign enclosed for them a plan he had drawn and forecasts
as to the further progress of the war in this letter prince andrew
pointed out to his father the danger of staying at bald hills so near
the theater of war and on the armys direct line of march and advised
him to move to moscow

at dinner that day on dessalles mentioning that the french were said
to have already entered vitebsk the old prince remembered his sons
letter

there was a letter from prince andrew today he said to princess
maryhavent you read it

no father she replied in a frightened voice

she could not have read the letter as she did not even know it had
arrived

he writes about this war said the prince with the ironic smile that
had become habitual to him in speaking of the present war

that must be very interesting said dessalles prince andrew is in a
position to know

oh very interesting said mademoiselle bourienne

go and get it for me said the old prince to mademoiselle bourienne
you knowunder the paperweight on the little table

mademoiselle bourienne jumped up eagerly

no dont he exclaimed with a frown you go michael ivánovich

michael ivánovich rose and went to the study but as soon as he had left
the room the old prince looking uneasily round threw down his napkin
and went himself

they cant do anything always make some muddle he muttered

while he was away princess mary dessalles mademoiselle bourienne and
even little nicholas exchanged looks in silence the old prince returned
with quick steps accompanied by michael ivánovich bringing the letter
and a plan these he put down beside himnot letting anyone read them at
dinner

on moving to the drawing room he handed the letter to princess mary and
spreading out before him the plan of the new building and fixing his
eyes upon it told her to read the letter aloud when she had done so
princess mary looked inquiringly at her father he was examining the
plan evidently engrossed in his own ideas

what do you think of it prince dessalles ventured to ask

i i said the prince as if unpleasantly awakened and not taking
his eyes from the plan of the building

very possibly the theater of war will move so near to us that

ha ha ha the theater of war said the prince i have said and still
say that the theater of war is poland and the enemy will never get
beyond the niemen

dessalles looked in amazement at the prince who was talking of the
niemen when the enemy was already at the dnieper but princess mary
forgetting the geographical position of the niemen thought that what
her father was saying was correct

when the snow melts theyll sink in the polish swamps only they could
fail to see it the prince continued evidently thinking of the
campaign of  which seemed to him so recent bennigsen should have
advanced into prussia sooner then things would have taken a different
turn

but prince dessalles began timidly the letter mentions
vitebsk

ah the letter yes replied the prince peevishly yes yes
his face suddenly took on a morose expression he paused yes he
writes that the french were beaten at at what river is it

dessalles dropped his eyes

the prince says nothing about that he remarked gently

doesnt he but i didnt invent it myself

no one spoke for a long time

yes yes well michael ivánovich he suddenly went on raising
his head and pointing to the plan of the building tell me how you mean
to alter it

michael ivánovich went up to the plan and the prince after speaking to
him about the building looked angrily at princess mary and dessalles and
went to his own room

princess mary saw dessalles embarrassed and astonished look fixed on
her father noticed his silence and was struck by the fact that her
father had forgotten his sons letter on the drawing room table but she
was not only afraid to speak of it and ask dessalles the reason of his
confusion and silence but was afraid even to think about it

in the evening michael ivánovich sent by the prince came to princess
mary for prince andrews letter which had been forgotten in the drawing
room she gave it to him and unpleasant as it was to her to do so
ventured to ask him what her father was doing

always busy replied michael ivánovich with a respectfully ironic
smile which caused princess mary to turn pale hes worrying very much
about the new building he has been reading a little but nowmichael
ivánovich went on lowering his voicenow hes at his desk busy with
his will i expect one of the princes favorite occupations of late
had been the preparation of some papers he meant to leave at his death
and which he called his will

and alpatych is being sent to smolensk asked princess mary

oh yes he has been waiting to start for some time





chapter iii

when michael ivánovich returned to the study with the letter the old
prince with spectacles on and a shade over his eyes was sitting at his
open bureau with screened candles holding a paper in his outstretched
hand and in a somewhat dramatic attitude was reading his manuscripthis
remarks as he termed itwhich was to be transmitted to the emperor
after his death

when michael ivánovich went in there were tears in the princes eyes
evoked by the memory of the time when the paper he was now reading had
been written he took the letter from michael ivánovichs hand put it
in his pocket folded up his papers and called in alpatych who had long
been waiting

the prince had a list of things to be bought in smolensk and walking up
and down the room past alpatych who stood by the door he gave his
instructions

first notepaperdo you hear eight quires like this sample gilt
edged it must be exactly like the sample varnish sealing wax as in
michael ivánovichs list

he paced up and down for a while and glanced at his notes

then hand to the governor in person a letter about the deed

next bolts for the doors of the new building were wanted and had to be
of a special shape the prince had himself designed and a leather case
had to be ordered to keep the will in

the instructions to alpatych took over two hours and still the prince
did not let him go he sat down sank into thought closed his eyes and
dozed off alpatych made a slight movement

well go go if anything more is wanted ill send after you

alpatych went out the prince again went to his bureau glanced into it
fingered his papers closed the bureau again and sat down at the table
to write to the governor

it was already late when he rose after sealing the letter he wished to
sleep but he knew he would not be able to and that most depressing
thoughts came to him in bed so he called tíkhon and went through the
rooms with him to show him where to set up the bed for that night

he went about looking at every corner every place seemed
unsatisfactory but worst of all was his customary couch in the study
that couch was dreadful to him probably because of the oppressive
thoughts he had had when lying there it was unsatisfactory everywhere
but the corner behind the piano in the sitting room was better than
other places he had never slept there yet

with the help of a footman tíkhon brought in the bedstead and began
putting it up

thats not right thats not right cried the prince and himself
pushed it a few inches from the corner and then closer in again

well at last ive finished now ill rest thought the prince and
let tíkhon undress him

frowning with vexation at the effort necessary to divest himself of his
coat and trousers the prince undressed sat down heavily on the bed
and appeared to be meditating as he looked contemptuously at his
withered yellow legs he was not meditating but only deferring the
moment of making the effort to lift those legs up and turn over on the
bed ugh how hard it is oh that this toil might end and you would
release me thought he pressing his lips together he made that effort
for the twentythousandth time and lay down but hardly had he done so
before he felt the bed rocking backwards and forwards beneath him as if
it were breathing heavily and jolting this happened to him almost every
night he opened his eyes as they were closing

no peace damn them he muttered angry he knew not with whom ah
yes there was something else important very important that i was
keeping till i should be in bed the bolts no i told him about them
no it was something something in the drawing room princess mary
talked some nonsense dessalles that fool said something something in
my pocketcant remember

tíkhon what did we talk about at dinner

about prince michael

be quiet quiet the prince slapped his hand on the table yes i
know prince andrews letter princess mary read it dessalles said
something about vitebsk now ill read it

he had the letter taken from his pocket and the tableon which stood a
glass of lemonade and a spiral wax candlemoved close to the bed and
putting on his spectacles he began reading only now in the stillness of
the night reading it by the faint light under the green shade did he
grasp its meaning for a moment

the french at vitebsk in four days march they may be at smolensk
perhaps are already there tíkhon tíkhon jumped up no no i dont
want anything he shouted

he put the letter under the candlestick and closed his eyes and there
rose before him the danube at bright noonday reeds the russian camp
and himself a young general without a wrinkle on his ruddy face
vigorous and alert entering potëmkins gaily colored tent and a
burning sense of jealousy of the favorite agitated him now as strongly
as it had done then he recalled all the words spoken at that first
meeting with potëmkin and he saw before him a plump rather sallow
faced short stout woman the empress mother with her smile and her
words at her first gracious reception of him and then that same face on
the catafalque and the encounter he had with zubov over her coffin
about his right to kiss her hand

oh quicker quicker to get back to that time and have done with all
the present quicker quickerand that they should leave me in peace





chapter iv

bald hills prince nicholas bolkónskis estate lay forty miles east
from smolensk and two miles from the main road to moscow

the same evening that the prince gave his instructions to alpatych
dessalles having asked to see princess mary told her that as the
prince was not very well and was taking no steps to secure his safety
though from prince andrews letter it was evident that to remain at bald
hills might be dangerous he respectfully advised her to send a letter
by alpatych to the provincial governor at smolensk asking him to let
her know the state of affairs and the extent of the danger to which bald
hills was exposed dessalles wrote this letter to the governor for
princess mary she signed it and it was given to alpatych with
instructions to hand it to the governor and to come back as quickly as
possible if there was danger

having received all his orders alpatych wearing a white beaver hata
present from the princeand carrying a stick as the prince did went out
accompanied by his family three wellfed roans stood ready harnessed to
a small conveyance with a leather hood

the larger bell was muffled and the little bells on the harness stuffed
with paper the prince allowed no one at bald hills to drive with
ringing bells but on a long journey alpatych liked to have them his
satellitesthe senior clerk a countinghouse clerk a scullery maid a
cook two old women a little pageboy the coachman and various
domestic serfswere seeing him off

his daughter placed chintzcovered down cushions for him to sit on and
behind his back his old sisterinlaw popped in a small bundle and one
of the coachmen helped him into the vehicle

there there womens fuss women women said alpatych puffing and
speaking rapidly just as the prince did and he climbed into the trap

after giving the clerk orders about the work to be done alpatych not
trying to imitate the prince now lifted the hat from his bald head and
crossed himself three times

if there is anything come back yakov alpatych for christs sake
think of us cried his wife referring to the rumors of war and the
enemy

women women womens fuss muttered alpatych to himself and started
on his journey looking round at the fields of yellow rye and the still
green thickly growing oats and at other quite black fields just being
plowed a second time

as he went along he looked with pleasure at the years splendid crop of
corn scrutinized the strips of ryefield which here and there were
already being reaped made his calculations as to the sowing and the
harvest and asked himself whether he had not forgotten any of the
princes orders

having baited the horses twice on the way he arrived at the town toward
evening on the fourth of august

alpatych kept meeting and overtaking baggage trains and troops on the
road as he approached smolensk he heard the sounds of distant firing
but these did not impress him what struck him most was the sight of a
splendid field of oats in which a camp had been pitched and which was
being mown down by the soldiers evidently for fodder this fact
impressed alpatych but in thinking about his own business he soon
forgot it

all the interests of his life for more than thirty years had been
bounded by the will of the prince and he never went beyond that limit
everything not connected with the execution of the princes orders did
not interest and did not even exist for alpatych

on reaching smolensk on the evening of the fourth of august he put up in
the gachina suburb across the dnieper at the inn kept by ferapontov
where he had been in the habit of putting up for the last thirty years
some thirty years ago ferapontov by alpatychs advice had bought a
wood from the prince had begun to trade and now had a house an inn
and a corn dealers shop in that province he was a stout dark red
faced peasant in the forties with thick lips a broad knob of a nose
similar knobs over his black frowning brows and a round belly

wearing a waistcoat over his cotton shirt ferapontov was standing
before his shop which opened onto the street on seeing alpatych he went
up to him

youre welcome yakov alpatych folks are leaving the town but you
have come to it said he

why are they leaving the town asked alpatych

thats what i say folks are foolish always afraid of the french

womens fuss womens fuss said alpatych

just what i think yakov alpatych what i say is orders have been
given not to let them in so that must be right and the peasants are
asking three rubles for cartingit isnt christian

yakov alpatych heard without heeding he asked for a samovar and for hay
for his horses and when he had had his tea he went to bed

all night long troops were moving past the inn next morning alpatych
donned a jacket he wore only in town and went out on business it was a
sunny morning and by eight oclock it was already hot a good day for
harvesting thought alpatych

from beyond the town firing had been heard since early morning at eight
oclock the booming of cannon was added to the sound of musketry many
people were hurrying through the streets and there were many soldiers
but cabs were still driving about tradesmen stood at their shops and
service was being held in the churches as usual alpatych went to the
shops to government offices to the post office and to the governors
in the offices and shops and at the post office everyone was talking
about the army and about the enemy who was already attacking the town
everybody was asking what should be done and all were trying to calm
one another

in front of the governors house alpatych found a large number of
people cossacks and a traveling carriage of the governors at the
porch he met two of the landed gentry one of whom he knew this man an
excaptain of police was saying angrily

its no joke you know its all very well if youre single one man
though undone is but one as the proverb says but with thirteen in
your family and all the property theyve brought us to utter ruin
what sort of governors are they to do that they ought to be hangedthe
brigands

oh come thats enough said the other

what do i care let him hear were not dogs said the excaptain of
police and looking round he noticed alpatych

oh yakov alpatych what have you come for

to see the governor by his excellencys order answered alpatych
lifting his head and proudly thrusting his hand into the bosom of his
coat as he always did when he mentioned the prince he has ordered
me to inquire into the position of affairs he added

yes go and find out shouted the angry gentleman theyve brought
things to such a pass that there are no carts or anything there it
is again do you hear said he pointing in the direction whence came
the sounds of firing

theyve brought us all to ruin the brigands he repeated and
descended the porch steps

alpatych swayed his head and went upstairs in the waiting room were
tradesmen women and officials looking silently at one another the
door of the governors room opened and they all rose and moved forward
an official ran out said some words to a merchant called a stout
official with a cross hanging on his neck to follow him and vanished
again evidently wishing to avoid the inquiring looks and questions
addressed to him alpatych moved forward and next time the official came
out addressed him one hand placed in the breast of his buttoned coat
and handed him two letters

to his honor baron asch from generalinchief prince bolkónski he
announced with such solemnity and significance that the official turned
to him and took the letters

a few minutes later the governor received alpatych and hurriedly said to
him

inform the prince and princess that i knew nothing i acted on the
highest instructionshere and he handed a paper to alpatych still
as the prince is unwell my advice is that they should go to moscow i am
just starting myself inform them

but the governor did not finish a dusty perspiring officer ran into the
room and began to say something in french the governors face expressed
terror

go he said nodding his head to alpatych and began questioning the
officer

eager frightened helpless glances were turned on alpatych when he came
out of the governors room involuntarily listening now to the firing
which had drawn nearer and was increasing in strength alpatych hurried
to his inn the paper handed to him by the governor said this

i assure you that the town of smolensk is not in the slightest danger
as yet and it is unlikely that it will be threatened with any i from
the one side and prince bagration from the other are marching to unite
our forces before smolensk which junction will be effected on the nd
instant and both armies with their united forces will defend our
compatriots of the province entrusted to your care till our efforts
shall have beaten back the enemies of our fatherland or till the last
warrior in our valiant ranks has perished from this you will see that
you have a perfect right to reassure the inhabitants of smolensk for
those defended by two such brave armies may feel assured of victory
instructions from barclay de tolly to baron asch the civil governor of
smolensk

people were anxiously roaming about the streets

carts piled high with household utensils chairs and cupboards kept
emerging from the gates of the yards and moving along the streets
loaded carts stood at the house next to ferapontovs and women were
wailing and lamenting as they said goodby a small watchdog ran round
barking in front of the harnessed horses

alpatych entered the innyard at a quicker pace than usual and went
straight to the shed where his horses and trap were the coachman was
asleep he woke him up told him to harness and went into the passage
from the hosts room came the sounds of a child crying the despairing
sobs of a woman and the hoarse angry shouting of ferapontov the cook
began running hither and thither in the passage like a frightened hen
just as alpatych entered

hes done her to death killed the mistress beat her dragged her
about so

what for asked alpatych

she kept begging to go away shes a woman take me away says she
dont let me perish with my little children folks she says are all
gone so why she says dont we go and he began beating and pulling
her about so

at these words alpatych nodded as if in approval and not wishing to
hear more went to the door of the room opposite the innkeepers where
he had left his purchases

you brute you murderer screamed a thin pale woman who with a baby
in her arms and her kerchief torn from her head burst through the door
at that moment and down the steps into the yard

ferapontov came out after her but on seeing alpatych adjusted his
waistcoat smoothed his hair yawned and followed alpatych into the
opposite room

going already said he

alpatych without answering or looking at his host sorted his packages
and asked how much he owed

well reckon up well have you been to the governors asked
ferapontov what has been decided

alpatych replied that the governor had not told him anything definite

with our business how can we get away said ferapontov wed have to
pay seven rubles a cartload to dorogobuzh and i tell them theyre not
christians to ask it selivanov now did a good stroke last
thursdaysold flour to the army at nine rubles a sack will you have
some tea he added

while the horses were being harnessed alpatych and ferapontov over their
tea talked of the price of corn the crops and the good weather for
harvesting

well it seems to be getting quieter remarked ferapontov finishing
his third cup of tea and getting up ours must have got the best of it
the orders were not to let them in so were in force it seems they
say the other day matthew ivanych platov drove them into the river
marina and drowned some eighteen thousand in one day

alpatych collected his parcels handed them to the coachman who had come
in and settled up with the innkeeper the noise of wheels hoofs and
bells was heard from the gateway as a little trap passed out

it was by now late in the afternoon half the street was in shadow the
other half brightly lit by the sun alpatych looked out of the window
and went to the door suddenly the strange sound of a faroff whistling
and thud was heard followed by a boom of cannon blending into a dull
roar that set the windows rattling

he went out into the street two men were running past toward the
bridge from different sides came whistling sounds and the thud of
cannon balls and bursting shells falling on the town but these sounds
were hardly heard in comparison with the noise of the firing outside the
town and attracted little attention from the inhabitants the town was
being bombarded by a hundred and thirty guns which napoleon had ordered
up after four oclock the people did not at once realize the meaning of
this bombardment

at first the noise of the falling bombs and shells only aroused
curiosity ferapontovs wife who till then had not ceased wailing under
the shed became quiet and with the baby in her arms went to the gate
listening to the sounds and looking in silence at the people

the cook and a shop assistant came to the gate with lively curiosity
everyone tried to get a glimpse of the projectiles as they flew over
their heads several people came round the corner talking eagerly

what force remarked one knocked the roof and ceiling all to
splinters

routed up the earth like a pig said another

thats grand it bucks one up laughed the first lucky you jumped
aside or it would have wiped you out

others joined those men and stopped and told how cannon balls had fallen
on a house close to them meanwhile still more projectiles now with the
swift sinister whistle of a cannon ball now with the agreeable
intermittent whistle of a shell flew over peoples heads incessantly
but not one fell close by they all flew over alpatych was getting into
his trap the innkeeper stood at the gate

what are you staring at he shouted to the cook who in her red skirt
with sleeves rolled up swinging her bare elbows had stepped to the
corner to listen to what was being said

what marvels she exclaimed but hearing her masters voice she turned
back pulling down her tuckedup skirt

once more something whistled but this time quite close swooping
downwards like a little bird a flame flashed in the middle of the
street something exploded and the street was shrouded in smoke

scoundrel what are you doing shouted the innkeeper rushing to the
cook

at that moment the pitiful wailing of women was heard from different
sides the frightened baby began to cry and people crowded silently
with pale faces round the cook the loudest sound in that crowd was her
wailing

ohhh dear souls dear kind souls dont let me die my good
souls

five minutes later no one remained in the street the cook with her
thigh broken by a shell splinter had been carried into the kitchen
alpatych his coachman ferapontovs wife and children and the house
porter were all sitting in the cellar listening the roar of guns the
whistling of projectiles and the piteous moaning of the cook which
rose above the other sounds did not cease for a moment the mistress
rocked and hushed her baby and when anyone came into the cellar asked in
a pathetic whisper what had become of her husband who had remained in
the street a shopman who entered told her that her husband had gone
with others to the cathedral whence they were fetching the wonder
working icon of smolensk

toward dusk the cannonade began to subside alpatych left the cellar and
stopped in the doorway the evening sky that had been so clear was
clouded with smoke through which high up the sickle of the new moon
shone strangely now that the terrible din of the guns had ceased a hush
seemed to reign over the town broken only by the rustle of footsteps
the moaning the distant cries and the crackle of fires which seemed
widespread everywhere the cooks moans had now subsided on two sides
black curling clouds of smoke rose and spread from the fires through
the streets soldiers in various uniforms walked or ran confusedly in
different directions like ants from a ruined anthill several of them
ran into ferapontovs yard before alpatychs eyes alpatych went out to
the gate a retreating regiment thronging and hurrying blocked the
street

noticing him an officer said the town is being abandoned get away
get away and then turning to the soldiers shouted

ill teach you to run into the yards

alpatych went back to the house called the coachman and told him to
set off ferapontovs whole household came out too following alpatych
and the coachman the women who had been silent till then suddenly
began to wail as they looked at the firesthe smoke and even the flames
of which could be seen in the failing twilightand as if in reply the
same kind of lamentation was heard from other parts of the street
inside the shed alpatych and the coachman arranged the tangled reins and
traces of their horses with trembling hands

as alpatych was driving out of the gate he saw some ten soldiers in
ferapontovs open shop talking loudly and filling their bags and
knapsacks with flour and sunflower seeds just then ferapontov returned
and entered his shop on seeing the soldiers he was about to shout at
them but suddenly stopped and clutching at his hair burst into sobs
and laughter

loot everything lads dont let those devils get it he cried taking
some bags of flour himself and throwing them into the street

some of the soldiers were frightened and ran away others went on
filling their bags on seeing alpatych ferapontov turned to him

russia is done for he cried alpatych ill set the place on fire
myself were done for and ferapontov ran into the yard

soldiers were passing in a constant stream along the street blocking it
completely so that alpatych could not pass out and had to wait
ferapontovs wife and children were also sitting in a cart waiting till
it was possible to drive out

night had come there were stars in the sky and the new moon shone out
amid the smoke that screened it on the sloping descent to the dnieper
alpatychs cart and that of the innkeepers wife which were slowly
moving amid the rows of soldiers and of other vehicles had to stop in
a side street near the crossroads where the vehicles had stopped a
house and some shops were on fire this fire was already burning itself
out the flames now died down and were lost in the black smoke now
suddenly flared up again brightly lighting up with strange distinctness
the faces of the people crowding at the crossroads black figures
flitted about before the fire and through the incessant crackling of
the flames talking and shouting could be heard seeing that his trap
would not be able to move on for some time alpatych got down and turned
into the side street to look at the fire soldiers were continually
rushing backwards and forwards near it and he saw two of them and a man
in a frieze coat dragging burning beams into another yard across the
street while others carried bundles of hay

alpatych went up to a large crowd standing before a high barn which was
blazing briskly the walls were all on fire and the back wall had fallen
in the wooden roof was collapsing and the rafters were alight the
crowd was evidently watching for the roof to fall in and alpatych
watched for it too

alpatych a familiar voice suddenly hailed the old man

mercy on us your excellency answered alpatych immediately
recognizing the voice of his young prince

prince andrew in his riding cloak mounted on a black horse was looking
at alpatych from the back of the crowd

why are you here he asked

your your excellency stammered alpatych and broke into sobs are
we really lost master

why are you here prince andrew repeated

at that moment the flames flared up and showed his young masters pale
worn face alpatych told how he had been sent there and how difficult it
was to get away

are we really quite lost your excellency he asked again

prince andrew without replying took out a notebook and raising his knee
began writing in pencil on a page he tore out he wrote to his sister

smolensk is being abandoned bald hills will be occupied by the enemy
within a week set off immediately for moscow let me know at once when
you will start send by special messenger to usvyazh

having written this and given the paper to alpatych he told him how to
arrange for departure of the prince the princess his son and the
boys tutor and how and where to let him know immediately before he
had had time to finish giving these instructions a chief of staff
followed by a suite galloped up to him

you are a colonel shouted the chief of staff with a german accent in
a voice familiar to prince andrew houses are set on fire in your
presence and you stand by what does this mean you will answer for it
shouted berg who was now assistant to the chief of staff of the
commander of the left flank of the infantry of the first army a place
as berg said very agreeable and well en evidence

prince andrew looked at him and without replying went on speaking to
alpatych

so tell them that i shall await a reply till the tenth and if by the
tenth i dont receive news that they have all got away i shall have to
throw up everything and come myself to bald hills

prince said berg recognizing prince andrew i only spoke because i
have to obey orders because i always do obey exactly you must
please excuse me he went on apologetically

something cracked in the flames the fire died down for a moment and
wreaths of black smoke rolled from under the roof there was another
terrible crash and something huge collapsed

ourourou yelled the crowd echoing the crash of the collapsing roof
of the barn the burning grain in which diffused a cakelike aroma all
around the flames flared up again lighting the animated delighted
exhausted faces of the spectators

the man in the frieze coat raised his arms and shouted

its fine lads now its raging its fine

thats the owner himself cried several voices

well then continued prince andrew to alpatych report to them as i
have told you and not replying a word to berg who was now mute beside
him he touched his horse and rode down the side street





chapter v

from smolensk the troops continued to retreat followed by the enemy on
the tenth of august the regiment prince andrew commanded was marching
along the highroad past the avenue leading to bald hills heat and
drought had continued for more than three weeks each day fleecy clouds
floated across the sky and occasionally veiled the sun but toward
evening the sky cleared again and the sun set in reddishbrown mist
heavy night dews alone refreshed the earth the unreaped corn was
scorched and shed its grain the marshes dried up the cattle lowed from
hunger finding no food on the sunparched meadows only at night and in
the forests while the dew lasted was there any freshness but on the
road the highroad along which the troops marched there was no such
freshness even at night or when the road passed through the forest the
dew was imperceptible on the sandy dust churned up more than six inches
deep as soon as day dawned the march began the artillery and baggage
wagons moved noiselessly through the deep dust that rose to the very
hubs of the wheels and the infantry sank ankledeep in that soft
choking hot dust that never cooled even at night some of this dust was
kneaded by the feet and wheels while the rest rose and hung like a
cloud over the troops settling in eyes ears hair and nostrils and
worst of all in the lungs of the men and beasts as they moved along that
road the higher the sun rose the higher rose that cloud of dust and
through the screen of its hot fine particles one could look with naked
eye at the sun which showed like a huge crimson ball in the unclouded
sky there was no wind and the men choked in that motionless
atmosphere they marched with handkerchiefs tied over their noses and
mouths when they passed through a village they all rushed to the wells
and fought for the water and drank it down to the mud

prince andrew was in command of a regiment and the management of that
regiment the welfare of the men and the necessity of receiving and
giving orders engrossed him the burning of smolensk and its
abandonment made an epoch in his life a novel feeling of anger against
the foe made him forget his own sorrow he was entirely devoted to the
affairs of his regiment and was considerate and kind to his men and
officers in the regiment they called him our prince were proud of
him and loved him but he was kind and gentle only to those of his
regiment to timokhin and the likepeople quite new to him belonging to
a different world and who could not know and understand his past as
soon as he came across a former acquaintance or anyone from the staff
he bristled up immediately and grew spiteful ironical and
contemptuous everything that reminded him of his past was repugnant to
him and so in his relations with that former circle he confined himself
to trying to do his duty and not to be unfair

in truth everything presented itself in a dark and gloomy light to
prince andrew especially after the abandonment of smolensk on the sixth
of august he considered that it could and should have been defended
and after his sick father had had to flee to moscow abandoning to
pillage his dearly beloved bald hills which he had built and peopled
but despite this thanks to his regiment prince andrew had something to
think about entirely apart from general questions two days previously
he had received news that his father son and sister had left for
moscow and though there was nothing for him to do at bald hills prince
andrew with a characteristic desire to foment his own grief decided that
he must ride there

he ordered his horse to be saddled and leaving his regiment on the
march rode to his fathers estate where he had been born and spent his
childhood riding past the pond where there used always to be dozens of
women chattering as they rinsed their linen or beat it with wooden
beetles prince andrew noticed that there was not a soul about and that
the little washing wharf torn from its place and half submerged was
floating on its side in the middle of the pond he rode to the keepers
lodge no one at the stone entrance gates of the drive and the door
stood open grass had already begun to grow on the garden paths and
horses and calves were straying in the english park prince andrew rode
up to the hothouse some of the glass panes were broken and of the
trees in tubs some were overturned and others dried up he called for
tarás the gardener but no one replied having gone round the corner of
the hothouse to the ornamental garden he saw that the carved garden
fence was broken and branches of the plum trees had been torn off with
the fruit an old peasant whom prince andrew in his childhood had often
seen at the gate was sitting on a green garden seat plaiting a bast
shoe

he was deaf and did not hear prince andrew ride up he was sitting on
the seat the old prince used to like to sit on and beside him strips of
bast were hanging on the broken and withered branch of a magnolia

prince andrew rode up to the house several limes in the old garden had
been cut down and a piebald mare and her foal were wandering in front of
the house among the rosebushes the shutters were all closed except at
one window which was open a little serf boy seeing prince andrew ran
into the house alpatych having sent his family away was alone at bald
hills and was sitting indoors reading the lives of the saints on
hearing that prince andrew had come he went out with his spectacles on
his nose buttoning his coat and hastily stepping up without a word
began weeping and kissing prince andrews knee

then vexed at his own weakness he turned away and began to report on
the position of affairs everything precious and valuable had been
removed to bogucharovo seventy quarters of grain had also been carted
away the hay and the spring corn of which alpatych said there had been
a remarkable crop that year had been commandeered by the troops and
mown down while still green the peasants were ruined some of them too
had gone to bogucharovo only a few remained

without waiting to hear him out prince andrew asked

when did my father and sister leave meaning when did they leave for
moscow

alpatych understanding the question to refer to their departure for
bogucharovo replied that they had left on the seventh and again went
into details concerning the estate management asking for instructions

am i to let the troops have the oats and to take a receipt for them
we have still six hundred quarters left he inquired

what am i to say to him thought prince andrew looking down on the
old mans bald head shining in the sun and seeing by the expression on
his face that the old man himself understood how untimely such questions
were and only asked them to allay his grief

yes let them have it replied prince andrew

if you noticed some disorder in the garden said alpatych it was
impossible to prevent it three regiments have been here and spent the
night dragoons mostly i took down the name and rank of their
commanding officer to hand in a complaint about it

well and what are you going to do will you stay here if the enemy
occupies the place asked prince andrew

alpatych turned his face to prince andrew looked at him and suddenly
with a solemn gesture raised his arm

he is my refuge his will be done he exclaimed

a group of bareheaded peasants was approaching across the meadow toward
the prince

well goodby said prince andrew bending over to alpatych you must
go away too take away what you can and tell the serfs to go to the
ryazan estate or to the one near moscow

alpatych clung to prince andrews leg and burst into sobs gently
disengaging himself the prince spurred his horse and rode down the
avenue at a gallop

the old man was still sitting in the ornamental garden like a fly
impassive on the face of a loved one who is dead tapping the last on
which he was making the bast shoe and two little girls running out
from the hot house carrying in their skirts plums they had plucked from
the trees there came upon prince andrew on seeing the young master
the elder one with frightened look clutched her younger companion by the
hand and hid with her behind a birch tree not stopping to pick up some
green plums they had dropped

prince andrew turned away with startled haste unwilling to let them see
that they had been observed he was sorry for the pretty frightened
little girl was afraid of looking at her and yet felt an irresistible
desire to do so a new sensation of comfort and relief came over him
when seeing these girls he realized the existence of other human
interests entirely aloof from his own and just as legitimate as those
that occupied him evidently these girls passionately desired one
thingto carry away and eat those green plums without being caughtand
prince andrew shared their wish for the success of their enterprise he
could not resist looking at them once more believing their danger past
they sprang from their ambush and chirruping something in their shrill
little voices and holding up their skirts their bare little sunburned
feet scampered merrily and quickly across the meadow grass

prince andrew was somewhat refreshed by having ridden off the dusty
highroad along which the troops were moving but not far from bald hills
he again came out on the road and overtook his regiment at its halting
place by the dam of a small pond it was past one oclock the sun a
red ball through the dust burned and scorched his back intolerably
through his black coat the dust always hung motionless above the buzz
of talk that came from the resting troops there was no wind as he
crossed the dam prince andrew smelled the ooze and freshness of the
pond he longed to get into that water however dirty it might be and
he glanced round at the pool from whence came sounds of shrieks and
laughter the small muddy green pond had risen visibly more than a
foot flooding the dam because it was full of the naked white bodies of
soldiers with brickred hands necks and faces who were splashing
about in it all this naked white human flesh laughing and shrieking
floundered about in that dirty pool like carp stuffed into a watering
can and the suggestion of merriment in that floundering mass rendered
it specially pathetic

one fairhaired young soldier of the third company whom prince andrew
knew and who had a strap round the calf of one leg crossed himself
stepped back to get a good run and plunged into the water another a
dark noncommissioned officer who was always shaggy stood up to his
waist in the water joyfully wriggling his muscular figure and snorted
with satisfaction as he poured the water over his head with hands
blackened to the wrists there were sounds of men slapping one another
yelling and puffing

everywhere on the bank on the dam and in the pond there was healthy
white muscular flesh the officer timokhin with his red little nose
standing on the dam wiping himself with a towel felt confused at seeing
the prince but made up his mind to address him nevertheless

its very nice your excellency wouldnt you like to said he

its dirty replied prince andrew making a grimace

well clear it out for you in a minute said timokhin and still
undressed ran off to clear the men out of the pond

the prince wants to bathe

what prince ours said many voices and the men were in such haste to
clear out that the prince could hardly stop them he decided that he
would rather wash himself with water in the barn

flesh bodies cannon fodder he thought and he looked at his own
naked body and shuddered not from cold but from a sense of disgust and
horror he did not himself understand aroused by the sight of that
immense number of bodies splashing about in the dirty pond

on the seventh of august prince bagration wrote as follows from his
quarters at mikháylovna on the smolensk road

dear count alexis andréevichhe was writing to arakcheev but knew that
his letter would be read by the emperor and therefore weighed every
word in it to the best of his ability

i expect the minister barclay de tolly has already reported the
abandonment of smolensk to the enemy it is pitiable and sad and the
whole army is in despair that this most important place has been
wantonly abandoned i for my part begged him personally most urgently
and finally wrote him but nothing would induce him to consent i swear
to you on my honor that napoleon was in such a fix as never before and
might have lost half his army but could not have taken smolensk our
troops fought and are fighting as never before with fifteen thousand
men i held the enemy at bay for thirtyfive hours and beat him but he
would not hold out even for fourteen hours it is disgraceful a stain
on our army and as for him he ought it seems to me not to live if
he reports that our losses were great it is not true perhaps about
four thousand not more and not even that but even were they ten
thousand thats war but the enemy has lost masses

what would it have cost him to hold out for another two days they would
have had to retire of their own accord for they had no water for men or
horses he gave me his word he would not retreat but suddenly sent
instructions that he was retiring that night we cannot fight in this
way or we may soon bring the enemy to moscow

there is a rumor that you are thinking of peace god forbid that you
should make peace after all our sacrifices and such insane retreats you
would set all russia against you and everyone of us would feel ashamed
to wear the uniform if it has come to thiswe must fight as long as
russia can and as long as there are men able to stand

one man ought to be in command and not two your minister may perhaps
be good as a minister but as a general he is not merely bad but
execrable yet to him is entrusted the fate of our whole country i
am really frantic with vexation forgive my writing boldly it is clear
that the man who advocates the conclusion of a peace and that the
minister should command the army does not love our sovereign and
desires the ruin of us all so i write you frankly call out the
militia for the minister is leading these visitors after him to moscow
in a most masterly way the whole army feels great suspicion of the
imperial aidedecamp wolzogen he is said to be more napoleons man
than ours and he is always advising the minister i am not merely civil
to him but obey him like a corporal though i am his senior this is
painful but loving my benefactor and sovereign i submit only i am
sorry for the emperor that he entrusts our fine army to such as he
consider that on our retreat we have lost by fatigue and left in the
hospital more than fifteen thousand men and had we attacked this would
not have happened tell me for gods sake what will russia our mother
russia say to our being so frightened and why are we abandoning our
good and gallant fatherland to such rabble and implanting feelings of
hatred and shame in all our subjects what are we scared at and of whom
are we afraid i am not to blame that the minister is vacillating a
coward dense dilatory and has all bad qualities the whole army
bewails it and calls down curses upon him





chapter vi

among the innumerable categories applicable to the phenomena of human
life one may discriminate between those in which substance prevails and
those in which form prevails to the latteras distinguished from
village country provincial or even moscow lifewe may allot
petersburg life and especially the life of its salons that life of the
salons is unchanging since the year  we had made peace and had
again quarreled with bonaparte and had made constitutions and unmade
them again but the salons of anna pávlovna and hélène remained just as
they had beenthe one seven and the other five years before at anna
pávlovnas they talked with perplexity of bonapartes successes just as
before and saw in them and in the subservience shown to him by the
european sovereigns a malicious conspiracy the sole object of which was
to cause unpleasantness and anxiety to the court circle of which anna
pávlovna was the representative and in hélènes salon which rumyántsev
himself honored with his visits regarding hélène as a remarkably
intelligent woman they talked with the same ecstasy in  as in
of the great nation and the great man and regretted our rupture
with france a rupture which according to them ought to be promptly
terminated by peace

of late since the emperors return from the army there had been some
excitement in these conflicting salon circles and some demonstrations of
hostility to one another but each camp retained its own tendency in
anna pávlovnas circle only those frenchmen were admitted who were deep
rooted legitimists and patriotic views were expressed to the effect
that one ought not to go to the french theater and that to maintain the
french troupe was costing the government as much as a whole army corps
the progress of the war was eagerly followed and only the reports most
flattering to our army were circulated in the french circle of hélène
and rumyántsev the reports of the cruelty of the enemy and of the war
were contradicted and all napoleons attempts at conciliation were
discussed in that circle they discountenanced those who advised hurried
preparations for a removal to kazan of the court and the girls
educational establishments under the patronage of the dowager empress
in hélènes circle the war in general was regarded as a series of formal
demonstrations which would very soon end in peace and the view
prevailed expressed by bilibinwho now in petersburg was quite at home
in hélènes house which every clever man was obliged to visitthat not
by gunpowder but by those who invented it would matters be settled in
that circle the moscow enthusiasmnews of which had reached petersburg
simultaneously with the emperors returnwas ridiculed sarcastically and
very cleverly though with much caution

anna pávlovnas circle on the contrary was enraptured by this enthusiasm
and spoke of it as plutarch speaks of the deeds of the ancients prince
vasíli who still occupied his former important posts formed a
connecting link between these two circles he visited his good friend
anna pávlovna as well as his daughters diplomatic salon and often
in his constant comings and goings between the two camps became confused
and said at hélènes what he should have said at anna pávlovnas and
vice versa

soon after the emperors return prince vasíli in a conversation about
the war at anna pávlovnas severely condemned barclay de tolly but was
undecided as to who ought to be appointed commanderinchief one of the
visitors usually spoken of as a man of great merit having described
how he had that day seen kutúzov the newly chosen chief of the
petersburg militia presiding over the enrollment of recruits at the
treasury cautiously ventured to suggest that kutúzov would be the man
to satisfy all requirements

anna pávlovna remarked with a melancholy smile that kutúzov had done
nothing but cause the emperor annoyance

i have talked and talked at the assembly of the nobility prince
vasíli interrupted but they did not listen to me i told them his
election as chief of the militia would not please the emperor they did
not listen to me

its all this mania for opposition he went on and who for it is
all because we want to ape the foolish enthusiasm of those muscovites
prince vasíli continued forgetting for a moment that though at hélènes
one had to ridicule the moscow enthusiasm at anna pávlovnas one had to
be ecstatic about it but he retrieved his mistake at once now is it
suitable that count kutúzov the oldest general in russia should
preside at that tribunal he will get nothing for his pains how could
they make a man commanderinchief who cannot mount a horse who drops
asleep at a council and has the very worst morals a good reputation he
made for himself at bucharest i dont speak of his capacity as a
general but at a time like this how they appoint a decrepit blind old
man positively blind a fine idea to have a blind general he cant see
anything to play blindmans bluff he cant see at all

no one replied to his remarks

this was quite correct on the twentyfourth of july but on the twenty
ninth of july kutúzov received the title of prince this might indicate
a wish to get rid of him and therefore prince vasílis opinion
continued to be correct though he was not now in any hurry to express
it but on the eighth of august a committee consisting of field marshal
saltykov arakcheev vyazmitinov lopukhin and kochubey met to consider
the progress of the war this committee came to the conclusion that our
failures were due to a want of unity in the command and though the
members of the committee were aware of the emperors dislike of kutúzov
after a short deliberation they agreed to advise his appointment as
commander in chief that same day kutúzov was appointed commanderin
chief with full powers over the armies and over the whole region
occupied by them

on the ninth of august prince vasíli at anna pávlovnas again met the
man of great merit the latter was very attentive to anna pávlovna
because he wanted to be appointed director of one of the educational
establishments for young ladies prince vasíli entered the room with the
air of a happy conqueror who has attained the object of his desires

well have you heard the great news prince kutúzov is field marshal
all dissensions are at an end i am so glad so delighted at last we
have a man said he glancing sternly and significantly round at
everyone in the drawing room

the man of great merit despite his desire to obtain the post of
director could not refrain from reminding prince vasíli of his former
opinion though this was impolite to prince vasíli in anna pávlovnas
drawing room and also to anna pávlovna herself who had received the
news with delight he could not resist the temptation

but prince they say he is blind said he reminding prince vasíli of
his own words

eh nonsense he sees well enough said prince vasíli rapidly in a
deep voice and with a slight coughthe voice and cough with which he was
wont to dispose of all difficulties

he sees well enough he added and what i am so pleased about he
went on is that our sovereign has given him full powers over all the
armies and the whole regionpowers no commanderinchief ever had
before he is a second autocrat he concluded with a victorious smile

god grant it god grant it said anna pávlovna

the man of great merit who was still a novice in court circles
wishing to flatter anna pávlovna by defending her former position on
this question observed

it is said that the emperor was reluctant to give kutúzov those powers
they say he blushed like a girl to whom joconde is read when he said to
kutúzov your emperor and the fatherland award you this honor

perhaps the heart took no part in that speech said anna pávlovna

oh no no warmly rejoined prince vasíli who would not now yield
kutúzov to anyone in his opinion kutúzov was not only admirable
himself but was adored by everybody no thats impossible said he
for our sovereign appreciated him so highly before

god grant only that prince kutúzov assumes real power and does not
allow anyone to put a spoke in his wheel observed anna pávlovna

understanding at once to whom she alluded prince vasíli said in a
whisper

i know for a fact that kutúzov made it an absolute condition that the
tsarevich should not be with the army do you know what he said to the
emperor

and prince vasíli repeated the words supposed to have been spoken by
kutúzov to the emperor i can neither punish him if he does wrong nor
reward him if he does right

oh a very wise man is prince kutúzov i have known him a long time

they even say remarked the man of great merit who did not yet
possess courtly tact that his excellency made it an express condition
that the sovereign himself should not be with the army

as soon as he said this both prince vasíli and anna pávlovna turned away
from him and glanced sadly at one another with a sigh at his naïvete





chapter vii

while this was taking place in petersburg the french had already passed
smolensk and were drawing nearer and nearer to moscow napoleons
historian thiers like other of his historians trying to justify his
hero says that he was drawn to the walls of moscow against his will he
is as right as other historians who look for the explanation of historic
events in the will of one man he is as right as the russian historians
who maintain that napoleon was drawn to moscow by the skill of the
russian commanders here besides the law of retrospection which regards
all the past as a preparation for events that subsequently occur the
law of reciprocity comes in confusing the whole matter a good
chessplayer having lost a game is sincerely convinced that his loss
resulted from a mistake he made and looks for that mistake in the
opening but forgets that at each stage of the game there were similar
mistakes and that none of his moves were perfect he only notices the
mistake to which he pays attention because his opponent took advantage
of it how much more complex than this is the game of war which occurs
under certain limits of time and where it is not one will that
manipulates lifeless objects but everything results from innumerable
conflicts of various wills

after smolensk napoleon sought a battle beyond dorogobuzh at vyazma and
then at tsarevozaymishche but it happened that owing to a conjunction
of innumerable circumstances the russians could not give battle till
they reached borodino seventy miles from moscow from vyazma napoleon
ordered a direct advance on moscow

moscou la capitale asiatique de ce grand empire la ville sacree des
peuples dalexandre moscou avec ses innombrables eglises en forme de
pagodes chinoises  this moscow gave napoleons imagination no rest on
the march from vyazma to tsarevozaymishche he rode his light bay
bobtailed ambler accompanied by his guards his bodyguard his pages
and aidesdecamp berthier his chief of staff dropped behind to
question a russian prisoner captured by the cavalry followed by
lelorgne dideville an interpreter he overtook napoleon at a gallop
and reined in his horse with an amused expression

 moscow the asiatic capital of this great empire the sacred city of
alexanders people moscow with its innumerable churches shaped like
chinese pagodas

well asked napoleon

one of platovs cossacks says that platovs corps is joining up with
the main army and that kutúzov has been appointed commanderinchief he
is a very shrewd and garrulous fellow

napoleon smiled and told them to give the cossack a horse and bring the
man to him he wished to talk to him himself several adjutants galloped
off and an hour later lavrushka the serf denisov had handed over to
rostóv rode up to napoleon in an orderlys jacket and on a french
cavalry saddle with a merry and tipsy face napoleon told him to ride
by his side and began questioning him

you are a cossack

yes a cossack your honor

the cossack not knowing in what company he was for napoleons plain
appearance had nothing about it that would reveal to an oriental mind
the presence of a monarch talked with extreme familiarity of the
incidents of the war says thiers narrating this episode in reality
lavrushka having got drunk the day before and left his master
dinnerless had been whipped and sent to the village in quest of
chickens where he engaged in looting till the french took him prisoner
lavrushka was one of those coarse barefaced lackeys who have seen all
sorts of things consider it necessary to do everything in a mean and
cunning way are ready to render any sort of service to their master
and are keen at guessing their masters baser impulses especially those
prompted by vanity and pettiness

finding himself in the company of napoleon whose identity he had easily
and surely recognized lavrushka was not in the least abashed but merely
did his utmost to gain his new masters favor

he knew very well that this was napoleon but napoleons presence could
no more intimidate him than rostóvs or a sergeant majors with the
rods would have done for he had nothing that either the sergeant major
or napoleon could deprive him of

so he rattled on telling all the gossip he had heard among the
orderlies much of it true but when napoleon asked him whether the
russians thought they would beat bonaparte or not lavrushka screwed up
his eyes and considered

in this question he saw subtle cunning as men of his type see cunning
in everything so he frowned and did not answer immediately

its like this he said thoughtfully if theres a battle soon yours
will win thats right but if three days pass then after that well
then that same battle will not soon be over

lelorgne dideville smilingly interpreted this speech to napoleon thus
if a battle takes place within the next three days the french will win
but if later god knows what will happen napoleon did not smile
though he was evidently in high good humor and he ordered these words
to be repeated

lavrushka noticed this and to entertain him further pretending not to
know who napoleon was added

we know that you have bonaparte and that he has beaten everybody in the
world but we are a different matterwithout knowing why or how this
bit of boastful patriotism slipped out at the end

the interpreter translated these words without the last phrase and
bonaparte smiled the young cossack made his mighty interlocutor
smile says thiers after riding a few paces in silence napoleon
turned to berthier and said he wished to see how the news that he was
talking to the emperor himself to that very emperor who had written his
immortally victorious name on the pyramids would affect this enfant du
don

 child of the don

the fact was accordingly conveyed to lavrushka

lavrushka understanding that this was done to perplex him and that
napoleon expected him to be frightened to gratify his new masters
promptly pretended to be astonished and awestruck opened his eyes
wide and assumed the expression he usually put on when taken to be
whipped as soon as napoleons interpreter had spoken says thiers
the cossack seized by amazement did not utter another word but rode
on his eyes fixed on the conqueror whose fame had reached him across
the steppes of the east all his loquacity was suddenly arrested and
replaced by a naïve and silent feeling of admiration napoleon after
making the cossack a present had him set free like a bird restored to
its native fields

napoleon rode on dreaming of the moscow that so appealed to his
imagination and the bird restored to its native fields galloped to
our outposts inventing on the way all that had not taken place but that
he meant to relate to his comrades what had really taken place he did
not wish to relate because it seemed to him not worth telling he found
the cossacks inquired for the regiment operating with platovs
detachment and by evening found his master nicholas rostóv quartered
at yankovo rostóv was just mounting to go for a ride round the
neighboring villages with ilyin he let lavrushka have another horse and
took him along with him





chapter viii

princess mary was not in moscow and out of danger as prince andrew
supposed

after the return of alpatych from smolensk the old prince suddenly
seemed to awake as from a dream he ordered the militiamen to be called
up from the villages and armed and wrote a letter to the commanderin
chief informing him that he had resolved to remain at bald hills to the
last extremity and to defend it leaving to the commanderinchiefs
discretion to take measures or not for the defense of bald hills where
one of russias oldest generals would be captured or killed and he
announced to his household that he would remain at bald hills

but while himself remaining he gave instructions for the departure of
the princess and dessalles with the little prince to bogucharovo and
thence to moscow princess mary alarmed by her fathers feverish and
sleepless activity after his previous apathy could not bring herself to
leave him alone and for the first time in her life ventured to disobey
him she refused to go away and her fathers fury broke over her in a
terrible storm he repeated every injustice he had ever inflicted on
her trying to convict her he told her she had worn him out had caused
his quarrel with his son had harbored nasty suspicions of him making
it the object of her life to poison his existence and he drove her from
his study telling her that if she did not go away it was all the same to
him he declared that he did not wish to remember her existence and
warned her not to dare to let him see her the fact that he did not as
she had feared order her to be carried away by force but only told her
not to let him see her cheered princess mary she knew it was a proof
that in the depth of his soul he was glad she was remaining at home and
had not gone away

the morning after little nicholas had left the old prince donned his
full uniform and prepared to visit the commanderinchief his caleche
was already at the door princess mary saw him walk out of the house in
his uniform wearing all his orders and go down the garden to review his
armed peasants and domestic serfs she sat by the window listening to
his voice which reached her from the garden suddenly several men came
running up the avenue with frightened faces

princess mary ran out to the porch down the flowerbordered path and
into the avenue a large crowd of militiamen and domestics were moving
toward her and in their midst several men were supporting by the
armpits and dragging along a little old man in a uniform and
decorations she ran up to him and in the play of the sunlight that
fell in small round spots through the shade of the limetree avenue
could not be sure what change there was in his face all she could see
was that his former stern and determined expression had altered to one
of timidity and submission on seeing his daughter he moved his helpless
lips and made a hoarse sound it was impossible to make out what he
wanted he was lifted up carried to his study and laid on the very
couch he had so feared of late

the doctor who was fetched that same night bled him and said that the
prince had had a seizure paralyzing his right side

it was becoming more and more dangerous to remain at bald hills and
next day they moved the prince to bogucharovo the doctor accompanying
him

by the time they reached bogucharovo dessalles and the little prince
had already left for moscow

for three weeks the old prince lay stricken by paralysis in the new
house prince andrew had built at bogucharovo ever in the same state
getting neither better nor worse he was unconscious and lay like a
distorted corpse he muttered unceasingly his eyebrows and lips
twitching and it was impossible to tell whether he understood what was
going on around him or not one thing was certainthat he was suffering
and wished to say something but what it was no one could tell it
might be some caprice of a sick and halfcrazy man or it might relate
to public affairs or possibly to family concerns

the doctor said this restlessness did not mean anything and was due to
physical causes but princess mary thought he wished to tell her
something and the fact that her presence always increased his
restlessness confirmed her opinion

he was evidently suffering both physically and mentally there was no
hope of recovery it was impossible for him to travel it would not do
to let him die on the road would it not be better if the end did come
the very end princess mary sometimes thought night and day hardly
sleeping at all she watched him and terrible to say often watched him
not with hope of finding signs of improvement but wishing to find
symptoms of the approach of the end

strange as it was to her to acknowledge this feeling in herself yet
there it was and what seemed still more terrible to her was that since
her fathers illness began perhaps even sooner when she stayed with
him expecting something to happen all the personal desires and hopes
that had been forgotten or sleeping within her had awakened thoughts
that had not entered her mind for yearsthoughts of a life free from the
fear of her father and even the possibility of love and of family
happinessfloated continually in her imagination like temptations of the
devil thrust them aside as she would questions continually recurred to
her as to how she would order her life now after that these were
temptations of the devil and princess mary knew it she knew that the
sole weapon against him was prayer and she tried to pray she assumed
an attitude of prayer looked at the icons repeated the words of a
prayer but she could not pray she felt that a different world had now
taken possession of herthe life of a world of strenuous and free
activity quite opposed to the spiritual world in which till now she had
been confined and in which her greatest comfort had been prayer she
could not pray could not weep and worldly cares took possession of
her

it was becoming dangerous to remain in bogucharovo news of the approach
of the french came from all sides and in one village ten miles from
bogucharovo a homestead had been looted by french marauders

the doctor insisted on the necessity of moving the prince the
provincial marshal of the nobility sent an official to princess mary to
persuade her to get away as quickly as possible and the head of the
rural police having come to bogucharovo urged the same thing saying
that the french were only some twentyfive miles away that french
proclamations were circulating in the villages and that if the princess
did not take her father away before the fifteenth he could not answer
for the consequences

the princess decided to leave on the fifteenth the cares of preparation
and giving orders for which everyone came to her occupied her all day
she spent the night of the fourteenth as usual without undressing in
the room next to the one where the prince lay several times waking up
she heard his groans and muttering the creak of his bed and the steps
of tíkhon and the doctor when they turned him over several times she
listened at the door and it seemed to her that his mutterings were
louder than usual and that they turned him over oftener she could not
sleep and several times went to the door and listened wishing to enter
but not deciding to do so though he did not speak princess mary saw
and knew how unpleasant every sign of anxiety on his account was to him
she had noticed with what dissatisfaction he turned from the look she
sometimes involuntarily fixed on him she knew that her going in during
the night at an unusual hour would irritate him

but never had she felt so grieved for him or so much afraid of losing
him she recalled all her life with him and in every word and act of his
found an expression of his love of her occasionally amid these memories
temptations of the devil would surge into her imagination thoughts of
how things would be after his death and how her new liberated life
would be ordered but she drove these thoughts away with disgust toward
morning he became quiet and she fell asleep

she woke late that sincerity which often comes with waking showed her
clearly what chiefly concerned her about her fathers illness on waking
she listened to what was going on behind the door and hearing him
groan said to herself with a sigh that things were still the same

but what could have happened what did i want i want his death she
cried with a feeling of loathing for herself

she washed dressed said her prayers and went out to the porch in
front of it stood carriages without horses and things were being packed
into the vehicles

it was a warm gray morning princess mary stopped at the porch still
horrified by her spiritual baseness and trying to arrange her thoughts
before going to her father the doctor came downstairs and went out to
her

he is a little better today said he i was looking for you one can
make out something of what he is saying his head is clearer come in
he is asking for you

princess marys heart beat so violently at this news that she grew pale
and leaned against the wall to keep from falling to see him talk to
him feel his eyes on her now that her whole soul was overflowing with
those dreadful wicked temptations was a torment of joy and terror

come said the doctor

princess mary entered her fathers room and went up to his bed he was
lying on his back propped up high and his small bony hands with their
knotted purple veins were lying on the quilt his left eye gazed
straight before him his right eye was awry and his brows and lips
motionless he seemed altogether so thin small and pathetic his face
seemed to have shriveled or melted his features had grown smaller
princess mary went up and kissed his hand his left hand pressed hers so
that she understood that he had long been waiting for her to come he
twitched her hand and his brows and lips quivered angrily

she looked at him in dismay trying to guess what he wanted of her when
she changed her position so that his left eye could see her face he
calmed down not taking his eyes off her for some seconds then his lips
and tongue moved sounds came and he began to speak gazing timidly and
imploringly at her evidently afraid that she might not understand

straining all her faculties princess mary looked at him the comic
efforts with which he moved his tongue made her drop her eyes and with
difficulty repress the sobs that rose to her throat he said something
repeating the same words several times she could not understand them
but tried to guess what he was saying and inquiringly repeated the words
he uttered

mmmarateate he repeated several times

it was quite impossible to understand these sounds the doctor thought
he had guessed them and inquiringly repeated mary are you afraid
the prince shook his head again repeated the same sounds

my mind my mind aches questioned princess mary

he made a mumbling sound in confirmation of this took her hand and
began pressing it to different parts of his breast as if trying to find
the right place for it

always thoughts about you thoughts he then uttered much more
clearly than he had done before now that he was sure of being
understood

princess mary pressed her head against his hand trying to hide her sobs
and tears

he moved his hand over her hair

i have been calling you all night he brought out

if only i had known she said through her tears i was afraid to
come in

he pressed her hand

werent you asleep

no i did not sleep said princess mary shaking her head

unconsciously imitating her father she now tried to express herself as
he did as much as possible by signs and her tongue too seemed to move
with difficulty

dear one dearest princess mary could not quite make out what he
had said but from his look it was clear that he had uttered a tender
caressing word such as he had never used to her before why didnt you
come in

and i was wishing for his death thought princess mary

he was silent awhile

thank you daughter dear for all for all forgive thank
you forgive thank you and tears began to flow from his
eyes call andrew he said suddenly and a childish timid expression
of doubt showed itself on his face as he spoke

he himself seemed aware that his demand was meaningless so at least it
seemed to princess mary

i have a letter from him she replied

he glanced at her with timid surprise

where is he

hes with the army father at smolensk

he closed his eyes and remained silent a long time then as if in answer
to his doubts and to confirm the fact that now he understood and
remembered everything he nodded his head and reopened his eyes

yes he said softly and distinctly russia has perished theyve
destroyed her

and he began to sob and again tears flowed from his eyes princess mary
could no longer restrain herself and wept while she gazed at his face

again he closed his eyes his sobs ceased he pointed to his eyes and
tíkhon understanding him wiped away the tears

then he again opened his eyes and said something none of them could
understand for a long time till at last tíkhon understood and repeated
it princess mary had sought the meaning of his words in the mood in
which he had just been speaking she thought he was speaking of russia
or prince andrew of herself of his grandson or of his own death and
so she could not guess his words

put on your white dress i like it was what he said

having understood this princess mary sobbed still louder and the doctor
taking her arm led her out to the veranda soothing her and trying to
persuade her to prepare for her journey when she had left the room the
prince again began speaking about his son about the war and about the
emperor angrily twitching his brows and raising his hoarse voice and
then he had a second and final stroke

princess mary stayed on the veranda the day had cleared it was hot and
sunny she could understand nothing think of nothing and feel nothing
except passionate love for her father love such as she thought she had
never felt till that moment she ran out sobbing into the garden and as
far as the pond along the avenues of young lime trees prince andrew had
planted

yes i i i wished for his death yes i wanted it to end
quicker i wished to be at peace and what will become of me what
use will peace be when he is no longer here princess mary murmured
pacing the garden with hurried steps and pressing her hands to her bosom
which heaved with convulsive sobs

when she had completed the tour of the garden which brought her again
to the house she saw mademoiselle bouriennewho had remained at
bogucharovo and did not wish to leave itcoming toward her with a
stranger this was the marshal of the nobility of the district who had
come personally to point out to the princess the necessity for her
prompt departure princess mary listened without understanding him she
led him to the house offered him lunch and sat down with him then
excusing herself she went to the door of the old princes room the
doctor came out with an agitated face and said she could not enter

go away princess go away go away

she returned to the garden and sat down on the grass at the foot of the
slope by the pond where no one could see her she did not know how long
she had been there when she was aroused by the sound of a womans
footsteps running along the path she rose and saw dunyasha her maid
who was evidently looking for her and who stopped suddenly as if in
alarm on seeing her mistress

please come princess the prince said dunyasha in a breaking
voice

immediately im coming im coming replied the princess hurriedly
not giving dunyasha time to finish what she was saying and trying to
avoid seeing the girl she ran toward the house

princess its gods will you must be prepared for everything said
the marshal meeting her at the house door

let me alone its not true she cried angrily to him

the doctor tried to stop her she pushed him aside and ran to her
fathers door why are these people with frightened faces stopping me
i dont want any of them and what are they doing here she thought
she opened the door and the bright daylight in that previously darkened
room startled her in the room were her nurse and other women they all
drew back from the bed making way for her he was still lying on the
bed as before but the stern expression of his quiet face made princess
mary stop short on the threshold

no hes not deadits impossible she told herself and approached
him and repressing the terror that seized her she pressed her lips to
his cheek but she stepped back immediately all the force of the
tenderness she had been feeling for him vanished instantly and was
replaced by a feeling of horror at what lay there before her no he is
no more he is not but here where he was is something unfamiliar and
hostile some dreadful terrifying and repellent mystery and hiding
her face in her hands princess mary sank into the arms of the doctor
who held her up

in the presence of tíkhon and the doctor the women washed what had been
the prince tied his head up with a handkerchief that the mouth should
not stiffen while open and with another handkerchief tied together the
legs that were already spreading apart then they dressed him in uniform
with his decorations and placed his shriveled little body on a table
heaven only knows who arranged all this and when but it all got done as
if of its own accord toward night candles were burning round his
coffin a pall was spread over it the floor was strewn with sprays of
juniper a printed band was tucked in under his shriveled head and in a
corner of the room sat a chanter reading the psalms

just as horses shy and snort and gather about a dead horse so the
inmates of the house and strangers crowded into the drawing room round
the coffinthe marshal the village elder peasant womenand all with
fixed and frightened eyes crossing themselves bowed and kissed the old
princes cold and stiffened hand





chapter ix

until prince andrew settled in bogucharovo its owners had always been
absentees and its peasants were of quite a different character from
those of bald hills they differed from them in speech dress and
disposition they were called steppe peasants the old prince used to
approve of them for their endurance at work when they came to bald hills
to help with the harvest or to dig ponds and ditches but he disliked
them for their boorishness

prince andrews last stay at bogucharovo when he introduced hospitals
and schools and reduced the quitrent the peasants had to pay had not
softened their disposition but had on the contrary strengthened in them
the traits of character the old prince called boorishness various
obscure rumors were always current among them at one time a rumor that
they would all be enrolled as cossacks at another of a new religion to
which they were all to be converted then of some proclamation of the
tsars and of an oath to the tsar paul in  in connection with which
it was rumored that freedom had been granted them but the landowners had
stopped it then of peter fedorovichs return to the throne in seven
years time when everything would be made free and so simple that
there would be no restrictions rumors of the war with bonaparte and his
invasion were connected in their minds with the same sort of vague
notions of antichrist the end of the world and pure freedom

in the vicinity of bogucharovo were large villages belonging to the
crown or to owners whose serfs paid quitrent and could work where they
pleased there were very few resident landlords in the neighborhood and
also very few domestic or literate serfs and in the lives of the
peasantry of those parts the mysterious undercurrents in the life of the
russian people the causes and meaning of which are so baffling to
contemporaries were more clearly and strongly noticeable than among
others one instance which had occurred some twenty years before was a
movement among the peasants to emigrate to some unknown warm rivers
hundreds of peasants among them the bogucharovo folk suddenly began
selling their cattle and moving in whole families toward the southeast
as birds migrate to somewhere beyond the sea so these men with their
wives and children streamed to the southeast to parts where none of
them had ever been they set off in caravans bought their freedom one
by one or ran away and drove or walked toward the warm rivers many
of them were punished some sent to siberia many died of cold and
hunger on the road many returned of their own accord and the movement
died down of itself just as it had sprung up without apparent reason
but such undercurrents still existed among the people and gathered new
forces ready to manifest themselves just as strangely unexpectedly and
at the same time simply naturally and forcibly now in  to anyone
living in close touch with these people it was apparent that these
undercurrents were acting strongly and nearing an eruption

alpatych who had reached bogucharovo shortly before the old princes
death noticed an agitation among the peasants and that contrary to
what was happening in the bald hills district where over a radius of
forty miles all the peasants were moving away and leaving their villages
to be devastated by the cossacks the peasants in the steppe region
round bogucharovo were it was rumored in touch with the french
received leaflets from them that passed from hand to hand and did not
migrate he learned from domestic serfs loyal to him that the peasant
karp who possessed great influence in the village commune and had
recently been away driving a government transport had returned with
news that the cossacks were destroying deserted villages but that the
french did not harm them alpatych also knew that on the previous day
another peasant had even brought from the village of visloukhovo which
was occupied by the french a proclamation by a french general that no
harm would be done to the inhabitants and if they remained they would
be paid for anything taken from them as proof of this the peasant had
brought from visloukhovo a hundred rubles in notes he did not know that
they were false paid to him in advance for hay

more important still alpatych learned that on the morning of the very
day he gave the village elder orders to collect carts to move the
princess luggage from bogucharovo there had been a village meeting at
which it had been decided not to move but to wait yet there was no time
to waste on the fifteenth the day of the old princes death the
marshal had insisted on princess marys leaving at once as it was
becoming dangerous he had told her that after the sixteenth he could
not be responsible for what might happen on the evening of the day the
old prince died the marshal went away promising to return next day for
the funeral but this he was unable to do for he received tidings that
the french had unexpectedly advanced and had barely time to remove his
own family and valuables from his estate

for some thirty years bogucharovo had been managed by the village elder
dron whom the old prince called by the diminutive dronushka

dron was one of those physically and mentally vigorous peasants who grow
big beards as soon as they are of age and go on unchanged till they are
sixty or seventy without a gray hair or the loss of a tooth as
straight and strong at sixty as at thirty

soon after the migration to the warm rivers in which he had taken
part like the rest dron was made village elder and overseer of
bogucharovo and had since filled that post irreproachably for twenty
three years the peasants feared him more than they did their master
the masters both the old prince and the young and the steward
respected him and jestingly called him the minister during the whole
time of his service dron had never been drunk or ill never after
sleepless nights or the hardest tasks had he shown the least fatigue
and though he could not read he had never forgotten a single money
account or the number of quarters of flour in any of the endless
cartloads he sold for the prince nor a single shock of the whole corn
crop on any single acre of the bogucharovo fields

alpatych arriving from the devastated bald hills estate sent for his
dron on the day of the princes funeral and told him to have twelve
horses got ready for the princess carriages and eighteen carts for the
things to be removed from bogucharovo though the peasants paid
quitrent alpatych thought no difficulty would be made about complying
with this order for there were two hundred and thirty households at
work in bogucharovo and the peasants were well to do but on hearing the
order dron lowered his eyes and remained silent alpatych named certain
peasants he knew from whom he told him to take the carts

dron replied that the horses of these peasants were away carting
alpatych named others but they too according to dron had no horses
available some horses were carting for the government others were too
weak and others had died for want of fodder it seemed that no horses
could be had even for the carriages much less for the carting

alpatych looked intently at dron and frowned just as dron was a model
village elder so alpatych had not managed the princes estates for
twenty years in vain he was a model steward possessing in the highest
degree the faculty of divining the needs and instincts of those he dealt
with having glanced at dron he at once understood that his answers did
not express his personal views but the general mood of the bogucharovo
commune by which the elder had already been carried away but he also
knew that dron who had acquired property and was hated by the commune
must be hesitating between the two camps the masters and the serfs
he noticed this hesitation in drons look and therefore frowned and
moved closer up to him

now just listen dronushka said he dont talk nonsense to me his
excellency prince andrew himself gave me orders to move all the people
away and not leave them with the enemy and there is an order from the
tsar about it too anyone who stays is a traitor to the tsar do you
hear

i hear dron answered without lifting his eyes

alpatych was not satisfied with this reply

eh dron it will turn out badly he said shaking his head

the power is in your hands dron rejoined sadly

eh dron drop it alpatych repeated withdrawing his hand from his
bosom and solemnly pointing to the floor at drons feet i can see
through you and three yards into the ground under you he continued
gazing at the floor in front of dron

dron was disconcerted glanced furtively at alpatych and again lowered
his eyes

you drop this nonsense and tell the people to get ready to leave their
homes and go to moscow and to get carts ready for tomorrow morning for
the princess things and dont go to any meeting yourself do you
hear

dron suddenly fell on his knees

yakov alpatych discharge me take the keys from me and discharge me
for christs sake

stop that cried alpatych sternly i see through you and three yards
under you he repeated knowing that his skill in beekeeping his
knowledge of the right time to sow the oats and the fact that he had
been able to retain the old princes favor for twenty years had long
since gained him the reputation of being a wizard and that the power of
seeing three yards under a man is considered an attribute of wizards

dron got up and was about to say something but alpatych interrupted
him

what is it you have got into your heads eh what are you thinking
of eh

what am i to do with the people said dron theyre quite beside
themselves i have already told them

told them i dare say said alpatych are they drinking he asked
abruptly

quite beside themselves yakov alpatych theyve fetched another
barrel

well then listen ill go to the police officer and you tell them
so and that they must stop this and the carts must be got ready

i understand

alpatych did not insist further he had managed people for a long time
and knew that the chief way to make them obey is to show no suspicion
that they can possibly disobey having wrung a submissive i understand
from dron alpatych contented himself with that though he not only
doubted but felt almost certain that without the help of troops the
carts would not be forthcoming

and so it was for when evening came no carts had been provided in the
village outside the drink shop another meeting was being held which
decided that the horses should be driven out into the woods and the
carts should not be provided without saying anything of this to the
princess alpatych had his own belongings taken out of the carts which
had arrived from bald hills and had those horses got ready for the
princess carriages meanwhile he went himself to the police
authorities





chapter x

after her fathers funeral princess mary shut herself up in her room and
did not admit anyone a maid came to the door to say that alpatych was
asking for orders about their departure this was before his talk with
dron princess mary raised herself on the sofa on which she had been
lying and replied through the closed door that she did not mean to go
away and begged to be left in peace

the windows of the room in which she was lying looked westward she lay
on the sofa with her face to the wall fingering the buttons of the
leather cushion and seeing nothing but that cushion and her confused
thoughts were centered on one subjectthe irrevocability of death and
her own spiritual baseness which she had not suspected but which had
shown itself during her fathers illness she wished to pray but did not
dare to dared not in her present state of mind address herself to god
she lay for a long time in that position

the sun had reached the other side of the house and its slanting rays
shone into the open window lighting up the room and part of the morocco
cushion at which princess mary was looking the flow of her thoughts
suddenly stopped unconsciously she sat up smoothed her hair got up
and went to the window involuntarily inhaling the freshness of the
clear but windy evening

yes you can well enjoy the evening now he is gone and no one will
hinder you she said to herself and sinking into a chair she let her
head fall on the window sill

someone spoke her name in a soft and tender voice from the garden and
kissed her head she looked up it was mademoiselle bourienne in a black
dress and weepers she softly approached princess mary sighed kissed
her and immediately began to cry the princess looked up at her all
their former disharmony and her own jealousy recurred to her mind but
she remembered too how he had changed of late toward mademoiselle
bourienne and could not bear to see her thereby showing how unjust were
the reproaches princess mary had mentally addressed to her besides is
it for me for me who desired his death to condemn anyone she
thought

princess mary vividly pictured to herself the position of mademoiselle
bourienne whom she had of late kept at a distance but who yet was
dependent on her and living in her house she felt sorry for her and
held out her hand with a glance of gentle inquiry mademoiselle
bourienne at once began crying again and kissed that hand speaking of
the princess sorrow and making herself a partner in it she said her
only consolation was the fact that the princess allowed her to share her
sorrow that all the old misunderstandings should sink into nothing but
this great grief that she felt herself blameless in regard to everyone
and that he from above saw her affection and gratitude the princess
heard her not heeding her words but occasionally looking up at her and
listening to the sound of her voice

your position is doubly terrible dear princess said mademoiselle
bourienne after a pause i understand that you could not and cannot
think of yourself but with my love for you i must do so has
alpatych been to you has he spoken to you of going away she asked

princess mary did not answer she did not understand who was to go or
where to is it possible to plan or think of anything now is it not
all the same she thought and did not reply

you know chere marie said mademoiselle bourienne that we are in
dangerare surrounded by the french it would be dangerous to move now
if we go we are almost sure to be taken prisoners and god knows

princess mary looked at her companion without understanding what she was
talking about

oh if anyone knew how little anything matters to me now she said
of course i would on no account wish to go away from him alpatych
did say something about going speak to him i can do nothing
nothing and dont want to

ive spoken to him he hopes we should be in time to get away tomorrow
but i think it would now be better to stay here said mademoiselle
bourienne because you will agree chere marie to fall into the hands
of the soldiers or of riotous peasants would be terrible

mademoiselle bourienne took from her reticule a proclamation not
printed on ordinary russian paper of general rameaus telling people
not to leave their homes and that the french authorities would afford
them proper protection she handed this to the princess

i think it would be best to appeal to that general she continued
and i am sure that all due respect would be shown you

princess mary read the paper and her face began to quiver with stifled
sobs

from whom did you get this she asked

they probably recognized that i am french by my name replied
mademoiselle bourienne blushing

princess mary with the paper in her hand rose from the window and with
a pale face went out of the room and into what had been prince andrews
study

dunyasha send alpatych or dronushka or somebody to me she said
and tell mademoiselle bourienne not to come to me she added hearing
mademoiselle bouriennes voice we must go at once at once she said
appalled at the thought of being left in the hands of the french

if prince andrew heard that i was in the power of the french that i
the daughter of prince nicholas bolkónski asked general rameau for
protection and accepted his favor this idea horrified her made her
shudder blush and feel such a rush of anger and pride as she had never
experienced before all that was distressing and especially all that
was humiliating in her position rose vividly to her mind they the
french would settle in this house m le general rameau would occupy
prince andrews study and amuse himself by looking through and reading
his letters and papers mademoiselle bourienne would do the honors of
bogucharovo for him i should be given a small room as a favor the
soldiers would violate my fathers newly dug grave to steal his crosses
and stars they would tell me of their victories over the russians and
would pretend to sympathize with my sorrow thought princess mary
not thinking her own thoughts but feeling bound to think like her father
and her brother for herself she did not care where she remained or what
happened to her but she felt herself the representative of her dead
father and of prince andrew involuntarily she thought their thoughts
and felt their feelings what they would have said and what they would
have done she felt bound to say and do she went into prince andrews
study trying to enter completely into his ideas and considered her
position

the demands of life which had seemed to her annihilated by her fathers
death all at once rose before her with a new previously unknown force
and took possession of her

agitated and flushed she paced the room sending now for michael
ivánovich and now for tíkhon or dron dunyasha the nurse and the other
maids could not say in how far mademoiselle bouriennes statement was
correct alpatych was not at home he had gone to the police neither
could the architect michael ivánovich who on being sent for came in
with sleepy eyes tell princess mary anything with just the same smile
of agreement with which for fifteen years he had been accustomed to
answer the old prince without expressing views of his own he now
replied to princess mary so that nothing definite could be got from his
answers the old valet tíkhon with sunken emaciated face that bore the
stamp of inconsolable grief replied yes princess to all princess
marys questions and hardly refrained from sobbing as he looked at her

at length dron the village elder entered the room and with a deep bow
to princess mary came to a halt by the doorpost

princess mary walked up and down the room and stopped in front of him

dronushka she said regarding as a sure friend this dronushka who
always used to bring a special kind of gingerbread from his visit to the
fair at vyazma every year and smilingly offer it to her dronushka now
since our misfortune she began but could not go on

we are all in gods hands said he with a sigh

they were silent for a while

dronushka alpatych has gone off somewhere and i have no one to turn
to is it true as they tell me that i cant even go away

why shouldnt you go away your excellency you can go said dron

i was told it would be dangerous because of the enemy dear friend i
can do nothing i understand nothing i have nobody i want to go away
tonight or early tomorrow morning

dron paused he looked askance at princess mary and said there are no
horses i told yakov alpatych so

why are there none asked the princess

its all gods scourge said dron what horses we had have been taken
for the army or have diedthis is such a year its not a case of
feeding horseswe may die of hunger ourselves as it is some go three
days without eating weve nothing weve been ruined

princess mary listened attentively to what he told her

the peasants are ruined they have no bread she asked

theyre dying of hunger said dron its not a case of carting

but why didnt you tell me dronushka isnt it possible to help them
ill do all i can

to princess mary it was strange that now at a moment when such sorrow
was filling her soul there could be rich people and poor and the rich
could refrain from helping the poor she had heard vaguely that there
was such a thing as landlords corn which was sometimes given to the
peasants she also knew that neither her father nor her brother would
refuse to help the peasants in need she only feared to make some
mistake in speaking about the distribution of the grain she wished to
give she was glad such cares presented themselves enabling her without
scruple to forget her own grief she began asking dron about the
peasants needs and what there was in bogucharovo that belonged to the
landlord

but we have grain belonging to my brother she said

the landlords grain is all safe replied dron proudly our prince
did not order it to be sold

give it to the peasants let them have all they need i give you leave
in my brothers name said she

dron made no answer but sighed deeply

give them that corn if there is enough of it distribute it all i give
this order in my brothers name and tell them that what is ours is
theirs we do not grudge them anything tell them so

dron looked intently at the princess while she was speaking

discharge me little mother for gods sake order the keys to be taken
from me said he i have served twentythree years and have done no
wrong discharge me for gods sake

princess mary did not understand what he wanted of her or why he was
asking to be discharged she replied that she had never doubted his
devotion and that she was ready to do anything for him and for the
peasants





chapter xi

an hour later dunyasha came to tell the princess that dron had come and
all the peasants had assembled at the barn by the princess order and
wished to have word with their mistress

but i never told them to come said princess mary i only told dron
to let them have the grain

only for gods sake princess dear have them sent away and dont go
out to them its all a trick said dunyasha and when yakov alpatych
returns let us get away and please dont

what is a trick asked princess mary in surprise

i know it is only listen to me for gods sake ask nurse too they say
they dont agree to leave bogucharovo as you ordered

youre making some mistake i never ordered them to go away said
princess mary call dronushka

dron came and confirmed dunyashas words the peasants had come by the
princess order

but i never sent for them declared the princess you must have given
my message wrong i only said that you were to give them the grain

dron only sighed in reply

if you order it they will go away said he

no no ill go out to them said princess mary and in spite of the
nurses and dunyashas protests she went out into the porch dron
dunyasha the nurse and michael ivánovich following her

they probably think i am offering them the grain to bribe them to
remain here while i myself go away leaving them to the mercy of the
french thought princess mary i will offer them monthly rations and
housing at our moscow estate i am sure andrew would do even more in my
place she thought as she went out in the twilight toward the crowd
standing on the pasture by the barn

the men crowded closer together stirred and rapidly took off their
hats princess mary lowered her eyes and tripping over her skirt came
close up to them so many different eyes old and young were fixed on
her and there were so many different faces that she could not
distinguish any of them and feeling that she must speak to them all at
once did not know how to do it but again the sense that she
represented her father and her brother gave her courage and she boldly
began her speech

i am very glad you have come she said without raising her eyes and
feeling her heart beating quickly and violently dronushka tells me
that the war has ruined you that is our common misfortune and i shall
grudge nothing to help you i am myself going away because it is
dangerous here the enemy is near because i am giving you
everything my friends and i beg you to take everything all our grain
so that you may not suffer want and if you have been told that i am
giving you the grain to keep you herethat is not true on the contrary
i ask you to go with all your belongings to our estate near moscow and
i promise you i will see to it that there you shall want for nothing
you shall be given food and lodging

the princess stopped sighs were the only sound heard in the crowd

i am not doing this on my own account she continued i do it in the
name of my dead father who was a good master to you and of my brother
and his son

again she paused no one broke the silence

ours is a common misfortune and we will share it together all that is
mine is yours she concluded scanning the faces before her

all eyes were gazing at her with one and the same expression she could
not fathom whether it was curiosity devotion gratitude or
apprehension and distrustbut the expression on all the faces was
identical

we are all very thankful for your bounty but it wont do for us to
take the landlords grain said a voice at the back of the crowd

but why not asked the princess

no one replied and princess mary looking round at the crowd found that
every eye she met now was immediately dropped

but why dont you want to take it she asked again

no one answered

the silence began to oppress the princess and she tried to catch
someones eye

why dont you speak she inquired of a very old man who stood just in
front of her leaning on his stick if you think something more is
wanted tell me i will do anything said she catching his eye

but as if this angered him he bent his head quite low and muttered

why should we agree we dont want the grain

why should we give up everything we dont agree dont agree we
are sorry for you but were not willing go away yourself alone
came from various sides of the crowd

and again all the faces in that crowd bore an identical expression
though now it was certainly not an expression of curiosity or gratitude
but of angry resolve

but you cant have understood me said princess mary with a sad smile
why dont you want to go i promise to house and feed you while here
the enemy would ruin you

but her voice was drowned by the voices of the crowd

were not willing let them ruin us we wont take your grain we dont
agree

again princess mary tried to catch someones eye but not a single eye
in the crowd was turned to her evidently they were all trying to avoid
her look she felt strange and awkward

oh yes an artful tale follow her into slavery pull down your houses
and go into bondage i dare say ill give you grain indeed she
says voices in the crowd were heard saying

with drooping head princess mary left the crowd and went back to the
house having repeated her order to dron to have horses ready for her
departure next morning she went to her room and remained alone with her
own thoughts





chapter xii

for a long time that night princess mary sat by the open window of her
room hearing the sound of the peasants voices that reached her from the
village but it was not of them she was thinking she felt that she
could not understand them however much she might think about them she
thought only of one thing her sorrow which after the break caused by
cares for the present seemed already to belong to the past now she
could remember it and weep or pray

after sunset the wind had dropped the night was calm and fresh toward
midnight the voices began to subside a cock crowed the full moon began
to show from behind the lime trees a fresh white dewy mist began to
rise and stillness reigned over the village and the house

pictures of the near pasther fathers illness and last momentsrose one
after another to her memory with mournful pleasure she now lingered
over these images repelling with horror only the last one the picture
of his death which she felt she could not contemplate even in
imagination at this still and mystic hour of night and these pictures
presented themselves to her so clearly and in such detail that they
seemed now present now past and now future

she vividly recalled the moment when he had his first stroke and was
being dragged along by his armpits through the garden at bald hills
muttering something with his helpless tongue twitching his gray
eyebrows and looking uneasily and timidly at her

even then he wanted to tell me what he told me the day he died she
thought he had always thought what he said then and she recalled in
all its detail the night at bald hills before he had the last stroke
when with a foreboding of disaster she had remained at home against his
will she had not slept and had stolen downstairs on tiptoe and going
to the door of the conservatory where he slept that night had listened
at the door in a suffering and weary voice he was saying something to
tíkhon speaking of the crimea and its warm nights and of the empress
evidently he had wanted to talk and why didnt he call me why didnt
he let me be there instead of tíkhon princess mary had thought and
thought again now now he will never tell anyone what he had in his
soul never will that moment return for him or for me when he might have
said all he longed to say and not tíkhon but i might have heard and
understood him why didnt i enter the room she thought perhaps he
would then have said to me what he said the day he died while talking
to tíkhon he asked about me twice he wanted to see me and i was
standing close by outside the door it was sad and painful for him to
talk to tíkhon who did not understand him i remember how he began
speaking to him about lise as if she were alivehe had forgotten she was
deadand tíkhon reminded him that she was no more and he shouted
fool he was greatly depressed from behind the door i heard how he
lay down on his bed groaning and loudly exclaimed my god why didnt
i go in then what could he have done to me what could i have lost and
perhaps he would then have been comforted and would have said that word
to me and princess mary uttered aloud the caressing word he had said
to her on the day of his death dearest she repeated and began
sobbing with tears that relieved her soul she now saw his face before
her and not the face she had known ever since she could remember and
had always seen at a distance but the timid feeble face she had seen
for the first time quite closely with all its wrinkles and details
when she stooped near to his mouth to catch what he said

dearest she repeated again

what was he thinking when he uttered that word what is he thinking
now this question suddenly presented itself to her and in answer she
saw him before her with the expression that was on his face as he lay in
his coffin with his chin bound up with a white handkerchief and the
horror that had seized her when she touched him and convinced herself
that that was not he but something mysterious and horrible seized her
again she tried to think of something else and to pray but could do
neither with wideopen eyes she gazed at the moonlight and the shadows
expecting every moment to see his dead face and she felt that the
silence brooding over the house and within it held her fast

dunyasha she whispered dunyasha she screamed wildly and tearing
herself out of this silence she ran to the servants quarters to meet
her old nurse and the maidservants who came running toward her





chapter xiii

on the seventeenth of august rostóv and ilyin accompanied by lavrushka
who had just returned from captivity and by an hussar orderly left
their quarters at yankovo ten miles from bogucharovo and went for a
rideto try a new horse ilyin had bought and to find out whether there
was any hay to be had in the villages

for the last three days bogucharovo had lain between the two hostile
armies so that it was as easy for the russian rearguard to get to it as
for the french vanguard rostóv as a careful squadron commander wished
to take such provisions as remained at bogucharovo before the french
could get them

rostóv and ilyin were in the merriest of moods on the way to
bogucharovo a princely estate with a dwelling house and farm where they
hoped to find many domestic serfs and pretty girls they questioned
lavrushka about napoleon and laughed at his stories and raced one
another to try ilyins horse

rostóv had no idea that the village he was entering was the property of
that very bolkónski who had been engaged to his sister

rostóv and ilyin gave rein to their horses for a last race along the
incline before reaching bogucharovo and rostóv outstripping ilyin was
the first to gallop into the village street

youre first cried ilyin flushed

yes always first both on the grassland and here answered rostóv
stroking his heated donets horse

and id have won on my frenchy your excellency said lavrushka from
behind alluding to his shabby cart horse only i didnt wish to
mortify you

they rode at a footpace to the barn where a large crowd of peasants was
standing

some of the men bared their heads others stared at the new arrivals
without doffing their caps two tall old peasants with wrinkled faces
and scanty beards emerged from the tavern smiling staggering and
singing some incoherent song and approached the officers

fine fellows said rostóv laughing is there any hay here

and how like one another said ilyin

a moost merry coompa sang one of the peasants with a
blissful smile

one of the men came out of the crowd and went up to rostóv

who do you belong to he asked

the french replied ilyin jestingly and here is napoleon
himselfand he pointed to lavrushka

then you are russians the peasant asked again

and is there a large force of you here said another a short man
coming up

very large answered rostóv but why have you collected here he
added is it a holiday

the old men have met to talk over the business of the commune replied
the peasant moving away

at that moment on the road leading from the big house two women and a
man in a white hat were seen coming toward the officers

the one in pink is mine so keep off said ilyin on seeing dunyasha
running resolutely toward him

shell be ours said lavrushka to ilyin winking

what do you want my pretty said ilyin with a smile

the princess ordered me to ask your regiment and your name

this is count rostóv squadron commander and i am your humble
servant

cooompany roared the tipsy peasant with a beatific smile as he
looked at ilyin talking to the girl following dunyasha alpatych
advanced to rostóv having bared his head while still at a distance

may i make bold to trouble your honor said he respectfully but with
a shade of contempt for the youthfulness of this officer and with a hand
thrust into his bosom my mistress daughter of general in chief prince
nicholas bolkónski who died on the fifteenth of this month finding
herself in difficulties owing to the boorishness of these peoplehe
pointed to the peasantsasks you to come up to the house wont you
please ride on a little farther said alpatych with a melancholy
smile as it is not convenient in the presence of he pointed to
the two peasants who kept as close to him as horseflies to a horse

ah alpatych ah yakov alpatych grand forgive us for christs
sake eh said the peasants smiling joyfully at him

rostóv looked at the tipsy peasants and smiled

or perhaps they amuse your honor remarked alpatych with a staid air
as he pointed at the old men with his free hand

no theres not much to be amused at here said rostóv and rode on a
little way whats the matter he asked

i make bold to inform your honor that the rude peasants here dont wish
to let the mistress leave the estate and threaten to unharness her
horses so that though everything has been packed up since morning her
excellency cannot get away

impossible exclaimed rostóv

i have the honor to report to you the actual truth said alpatych

rostóv dismounted gave his horse to the orderly and followed alpatych
to the house questioning him as to the state of affairs it appeared
that the princess offer of corn to the peasants the previous day and
her talk with dron and at the meeting had actually had so bad an effect
that dron had finally given up the keys and joined the peasants and had
not appeared when alpatych sent for him and that in the morning when
the princess gave orders to harness for her journey the peasants had
come in a large crowd to the barn and sent word that they would not let
her leave the village that there was an order not to move and that
they would unharness the horses alpatych had gone out to admonish them
but was told it was chiefly karp who did the talking dron not showing
himself in the crowd that they could not let the princess go that
there was an order to the contrary but that if she stayed they would
serve her as before and obey her in everything

at the moment when rostóv and ilyin were galloping along the road
princess mary despite the dissuasions of alpatych her nurse and the
maids had given orders to harness and intended to start but when the
cavalrymen were espied they were taken for frenchmen the coachman ran
away and the women in the house began to wail

father benefactor god has sent you exclaimed deeply moved voices as
rostóv passed through the anteroom

princess mary was sitting helpless and bewildered in the large sitting
room when rostóv was shown in she could not grasp who he was and why
he had come or what was happening to her when she saw his russian
face and by his walk and the first words he uttered recognized him as a
man of her own class she glanced at him with her deep radiant look and
began speaking in a voice that faltered and trembled with emotion this
meeting immediately struck rostóv as a romantic event a helpless girl
overwhelmed with grief left to the mercy of coarse rioting peasants
and what a strange fate sent me here what gentleness and nobility there
are in her features and expression thought he as he looked at her and
listened to her timid story

when she began to tell him that all this had happened the day after her
fathers funeral her voice trembled she turned away and then as if
fearing he might take her words as meant to move him to pity looked at
him with an apprehensive glance of inquiry there were tears in rostóvs
eyes princess mary noticed this and glanced gratefully at him with that
radiant look which caused the plainness of her face to be forgotten

i cannot express princess how glad i am that i happened to ride here
and am able to show my readiness to serve you said rostóv rising go
when you please and i give you my word of honor that no one shall dare
to cause you annoyance if only you will allow me to act as your escort
and bowing respectfully as if to a lady of royal blood he moved toward
the door

rostóvs deferential tone seemed to indicate that though he would
consider himself happy to be acquainted with her he did not wish to
take advantage of her misfortunes to intrude upon her

princess mary understood this and appreciated his delicacy

i am very very grateful to you she said in french but i hope it
was all a misunderstanding and that no one is to blame for it she
suddenly began to cry

excuse me she said

rostóv knitting his brows left the room with another low bow





chapter xiv

well is she pretty ah friendmy pink one is delicious her name is
dunyasha

but on glancing at rostóvs face ilyin stopped short he saw that his
hero and commander was following quite a different train of thought

rostóv glanced angrily at ilyin and without replying strode off with
rapid steps to the village

ill show them ill give it to them the brigands said he to
himself

alpatych at a gliding trot only just managing not to run kept up with
him with difficulty

what decision have you been pleased to come to said he

rostóv stopped and clenching his fists suddenly and sternly turned on
alpatych

decision what decision old dotard cried he what have you been
about eh the peasants are rioting and you cant manage them youre a
traitor yourself i know you ill flay you all alive and as if
afraid of wasting his store of anger he left alpatych and went rapidly
forward alpatych mastering his offended feelings kept pace with
rostóv at a gliding gait and continued to impart his views he said the
peasants were obdurate and that at the present moment it would be
imprudent to overresist them without an armed force and would it not
be better first to send for the military

ill give them armed force ill overresist them uttered rostóv
meaninglessly breathless with irrational animal fury and the need to
vent it

without considering what he would do he moved unconciously with quick
resolute steps toward the crowd and the nearer he drew to it the more
alpatych felt that this unreasonable action might produce good results
the peasants in the crowd were similarly impressed when they saw
rostóvs rapid firm steps and resolute frowning face

after the hussars had come to the village and rostóv had gone to see the
princess a certain confusion and dissension had arisen among the crowd
some of the peasants said that these new arrivals were russians and
might take it amiss that the mistress was being detained dron was of
this opinion but as soon as he expressed it karp and others attacked
their exelder

how many years have you been fattening on the commune karp shouted at
him its all one to you youll dig up your pot of money and take it
away with you what does it matter to you whether our homes are
ruined or not

weve been told to keep order and that no one is to leave their homes
or take away a single grain and thats all about it cried another

it was your sons turn to be conscripted but no fear you begrudged
your lump of a son a little old man suddenly began attacking dronand
so they took my vanka to be shaved for a soldier but we all have to
die

to be sure we all have to die im not against the commune said
dron

thats itnot against it youve filled your belly

the two tall peasants had their say as soon as rostóv followed by
ilyin lavrushka and alpatych came up to the crowd karp thrusting
his fingers into his belt and smiling a little walked to the front
dron on the contrary retired to the rear and the crowd drew closer
together

who is your elder here hey shouted rostóv coming up to the crowd
with quick steps

the elder what do you want with him asked karp

but before the words were well out of his mouth his cap flew off and a
fierce blow jerked his head to one side

caps off traitors shouted rostóv in a wrathful voice wheres the
elder he cried furiously

the elder he wants the elder dron zakharych you meek and
flustered voices here and there were heard calling and caps began to
come off their heads

we dont riot were following the orders declared karp and at that
moment several voices began speaking together

its as the old men have decidedtheres too many of you giving
orders

arguing mutiny brigands traitors cried rostóv unmeaningly in a
voice not his own gripping karp by the collar bind him bind him he
shouted though there was no one to bind him but lavrushka and alpatych

lavrushka however ran up to karp and seized him by the arms from
behind

shall i call up our men from beyond the hill he called out

alpatych turned to the peasants and ordered two of them by name to come
and bind karp the men obediently came out of the crowd and began taking
off their belts

wheres the elder demanded rostóv in a loud voice

with a pale and frowning face dron stepped out of the crowd

are you the elder bind him lavrushka shouted rostóv as if that
order too could not possibly meet with any opposition

and in fact two more peasants began binding dron who took off his own
belt and handed it to them as if to aid them

and you all listen to me said rostóv to the peasants be off to your
houses at once and dont let one of your voices be heard

why weve not done any harm we did it just out of foolishness its
all nonsense i said then that it was not in order voices were heard
bickering with one another

there what did i say said alpatych coming into his own again its
wrong lads

all our stupidity yakov alpatych came the answers and the crowd
began at once to disperse through the village

the two bound men were led off to the masters house the two drunken
peasants followed them

aye when i look at you said one of them to karp

how can one talk to the masters like that what were you thinking of
you fool added the othera real fool

two hours later the carts were standing in the courtyard of the
bogucharovo house the peasants were briskly carrying out the
proprietors goods and packing them on the carts and dron liberated at
princess marys wish from the cupboard where he had been confined was
standing in the yard directing the men

dont put it in so carelessly said one of the peasants a man with a
round smiling face taking a casket from a housemaid you know it has
cost money how can you chuck it in like that or shove it under the cord
where itll get rubbed i dont like that way of doing things let it
all be done properly according to rule look here put it under the
bast matting and cover it with haythats the way

eh books books said another peasant bringing out prince andrews
library cupboards dont catch up against it its heavy ladssolid
books

yes they worked all day and didnt play remarked the tall round
faced peasant gravely pointing with a significant wink at the
dictionaries that were on the top

unwilling to obtrude himself on the princess rostóv did not go back to
the house but remained in the village awaiting her departure when her
carriage drove out of the house he mounted and accompanied her eight
miles from bogucharovo to where the road was occupied by our troops at
the inn at yankovo he respectfully took leave of her for the first time
permitting himself to kiss her hand

how can you speak so he blushingly replied to princess marys
expressions of gratitude for her deliverance as she termed what had
occurred any police officer would have done as much if we had had
only peasants to fight we should not have let the enemy come so far
said he with a sense of shame and wishing to change the subject i am
only happy to have had the opportunity of making your acquaintance
goodbye princess i wish you happiness and consolation and hope to
meet you again in happier circumstances if you dont want to make me
blush please dont thank me

but the princess if she did not again thank him in words thanked him
with the whole expression of her face radiant with gratitude and
tenderness she could not believe that there was nothing to thank him
for on the contrary it seemed to her certain that had he not been
there she would have perished at the hands of the mutineers and of the
french and that he had exposed himself to terrible and obvious danger
to save her and even more certain was it that he was a man of lofty and
noble soul able to understand her position and her sorrow his kind
honest eyes with the tears rising in them when she herself had begun to
cry as she spoke of her loss did not leave her memory

when she had taken leave of him and remained alone she suddenly felt her
eyes filling with tears and then not for the first time the strange
question presented itself to her did she love him

on the rest of the way to moscow though the princess position was not
a cheerful one dunyasha who went with her in the carriage more than
once noticed that her mistress leaned out of the window and smiled at
something with an expression of mingled joy and sorrow

well supposing i do love him thought princess mary

ashamed as she was of acknowledging to herself that she had fallen in
love with a man who would perhaps never love her she comforted herself
with the thought that no one would ever know it and that she would not
be to blame if without ever speaking of it to anyone she continued to
the end of her life to love the man with whom she had fallen in love for
the first and last time in her life

sometimes when she recalled his looks his sympathy and his words
happiness did not appear impossible to her it was at those moments that
dunyasha noticed her smiling as she looked out of the carriage window

was it not fate that brought him to bogucharovo and at that very
moment thought princess mary and that caused his sister to refuse my
brother and in all this princess mary saw the hand of providence

the impression the princess made on rostóv was a very agreeable one to
remember her gave him pleasure and when his comrades hearing of his
adventure at bogucharovo rallied him on having gone to look for hay and
having picked up one of the wealthiest heiresses in russia he grew
angry it made him angry just because the idea of marrying the gentle
princess mary who was attractive to him and had an enormous fortune
had against his will more than once entered his head for himself
personally nicholas could not wish for a better wife by marrying her he
would make the countess his mother happy would be able to put his
fathers affairs in order and would evenhe felt itensure princess
marys happiness

but sónya and his plighted word that was why rostóv grew angry when he
was rallied about princess bolkónskaya





chapter xv

on receiving command of the armies kutúzov remembered prince andrew and
sent an order for him to report at headquarters

prince andrew arrived at tsarevozaymishche on the very day and at the
very hour that kutúzov was reviewing the troops for the first time he
stopped in the village at the priests house in front of which stood the
commanderinchiefs carriage and he sat down on the bench at the gate
awaiting his serene highness as everyone now called kutúzov from the
field beyond the village came now sounds of regimental music and now the
roar of many voices shouting hurrah to the new commanderinchief
two orderlies a courier and a majordomo stood near by some ten paces
from prince andrew availing themselves of kutúzovs absence and of the
fine weather a short swarthy lieutenant colonel of hussars with thick
mustaches and whiskers rode up to the gate and glancing at prince
andrew inquired whether his serene highness was putting up there and
whether he would soon be back

prince andrew replied that he was not on his serene highness staff but
was himself a new arrival the lieutenant colonel turned to a smart
orderly who with the peculiar contempt with which a commanderin
chiefs orderly speaks to officers replied

what his serene highness i expect hell be here soon what do you
want

the lieutenant colonel of hussars smiled beneath his mustache at the
orderlys tone dismounted gave his horse to a dispatch runner and
approached bolkónski with a slight bow bolkónski made room for him on
the bench and the lieutenant colonel sat down beside him

youre also waiting for the commanderinchief said he they say he
weceives evewyone thank god its awful with those sausage eaters
ermolov had weason to ask to be pwomoted to be a german now pwaps
wussians will get a look in as it was devil only knows what was
happening we kept wetweating and wetweating did you take part in the
campaign he asked

i had the pleasure replied prince andrew not only of taking part in
the retreat but of losing in that retreat all i held dearnot to mention
the estate and home of my birthmy father who died of grief i belong
to the province of smolensk

ah youre pwince bolkónski vewy glad to make your acquaintance im
lieutenant colonel denisov better known as vaska said denisov
pressing prince andrews hand and looking into his face with a
particularly kindly attention yes i heard said he sympathetically
and after a short pause added yes its scythian warfare its all
vewy wellonly not for those who get it in the neck so you are pwince
andwew bolkónski he swayed his head vewy pleased pwince to make
your acquaintance he repeated again smiling sadly and he again
pressed prince andrews hand

prince andrew knew denisov from what natásha had told him of her first
suitor this memory carried him sadly and sweetly back to those painful
feelings of which he had not thought lately but which still found place
in his soul of late he had received so many new and very serious
impressionssuch as the retreat from smolensk his visit to bald hills
and the recent news of his fathers deathand had experienced so many
emotions that for a long time past those memories had not entered his
mind and now that they did they did not act on him with nearly their
former strength for denisov too the memories awakened by the name of
bolkónski belonged to a distant romantic past when after supper and
after natáshas singing he had proposed to a little girl of fifteen
without realizing what he was doing he smiled at the recollection of
that time and of his love for natásha and passed at once to what now
interested him passionately and exclusively this was a plan of campaign
he had devised while serving at the outposts during the retreat he had
proposed that plan to barclay de tolly and now wished to propose it to
kutúzov the plan was based on the fact that the french line of
operation was too extended and it proposed that instead of or
concurrently with action on the front to bar the advance of the french
we should attack their line of communication he began explaining his
plan to prince andrew

they cant hold all that line its impossible i will undertake to
bweak thwough give me five hundwed men and i will bweak the line
thats certain theres only one wayguewilla warfare

denisov rose and began gesticulating as he explained his plan to
bolkónski in the midst of his explanation shouts were heard from the
army growing more incoherent and more diffused mingling with music and
songs and coming from the field where the review was held sounds of
hoofs and shouts were nearing the village

hes coming hes coming shouted a cossack standing at the gate

bolkónski and denisov moved to the gate at which a knot of soldiers a
guard of honor was standing and they saw kutúzov coming down the
street mounted on a rather small sorrel horse a huge suite of generals
rode behind him barclay was riding almost beside him and a crowd of
officers ran after and around them shouting hurrah

his adjutants galloped into the yard before him kutúzov was impatiently
urging on his horse which ambled smoothly under his weight and he
raised his hand to his white horse guards cap with a red band and no
peak nodding his head continually when he came up to the guard of
honor a fine set of grenadiers mostly wearing decorations who were
giving him the salute he looked at them silently and attentively for
nearly a minute with the steady gaze of a commander and then turned to
the crowd of generals and officers surrounding him suddenly his face
assumed a subtle expression he shrugged his shoulders with an air of
perplexity

and with such fine fellows to retreat and retreat well goodby
general he added and rode into the yard past prince andrew and
denisov

hurrah hurrah hurrah shouted those behind him

since prince andrew had last seen him kutúzov had grown still more
corpulent flaccid and fat but the bleached eyeball the scar and the
familiar weariness of his expression were still the same he was wearing
the white horse guards cap and a military overcoat with a whip hanging
over his shoulder by a thin strap he sat heavily and swayed limply on
his brisk little horse

whew whew whew he whistled just audibly as he rode into the
yard his face expressed the relief of relaxed strain felt by a man who
means to rest after a ceremony he drew his left foot out of the stirrup
and lurching with his whole body and puckering his face with the
effort raised it with difficulty onto the saddle leaned on his knee
groaned and slipped down into the arms of the cossacks and adjutants
who stood ready to assist him

he pulled himself together looked round screwing up his eyes glanced
at prince andrew and evidently not recognizing him moved with his
waddling gait to the porch whew whew whew he whistled and
again glanced at prince andrew as often occurs with old men it was
only after some seconds that the impression produced by prince andrews
face linked itself up with kutúzovs remembrance of his personality

ah how do you do my dear prince how do you do my dear boy come
along said he glancing wearily round and he stepped onto the porch
which creaked under his weight

he unbuttoned his coat and sat down on a bench in the porch

and hows your father

i received news of his death yesterday replied prince andrew
abruptly

kutúzov looked at him with eyes wide open with dismay and then took off
his cap and crossed himself

may the kingdom of heaven be his gods will be done to us all he
sighed deeply his whole chest heaving and was silent for a while i
loved him and respected him and sympathize with you with all my heart

he embraced prince andrew pressing him to his fat breast and for some
time did not let him go when he released him prince andrew saw that
kutúzovs flabby lips were trembling and that tears were in his eyes he
sighed and pressed on the bench with both hands to raise himself

come come with me well have a talk said he

but at that moment denisov no more intimidated by his superiors than by
the enemy came with jingling spurs up the steps of the porch despite
the angry whispers of the adjutants who tried to stop him kutúzov his
hands still pressed on the seat glanced at him glumly denisov having
given his name announced that he had to communicate to his serene
highness a matter of great importance for their countrys welfare
kutúzov looked wearily at him and lifting his hands with a gesture of
annoyance folded them across his stomach repeating the words for our
countrys welfare well what is it speak denisov blushed like a girl
it was strange to see the color rise in that shaggy bibulous time
worn face and boldly began to expound his plan of cutting the enemys
lines of communication between smolensk and vyazma denisov came from
those parts and knew the country well his plan seemed decidedly a good
one especially from the strength of conviction with which he spoke
kutúzov looked down at his own legs occasionally glancing at the door
of the adjoining hut as if expecting something unpleasant to emerge from
it and from that hut while denisov was speaking a general with a
portfolio under his arm really did appear

what said kutúzov in the midst of denisovs explanations are you
ready so soon

ready your serene highness replied the general

kutúzov swayed his head as much as to say how is one man to deal with
it all and again listened to denisov

i give my word of honor as a wussian officer said denisov that i
can bweak napoleons line of communication

what relation are you to intendant general kiril andréevich denisov
asked kutúzov interrupting him

he is my uncle your sewene highness

ah we were friends said kutúzov cheerfully all right all right
friend stay here at the staff and tomorrow well have a talk

with a nod to denisov he turned away and put out his hand for the papers
konovnitsyn had brought him

would not your serene highness like to come inside said the general
on duty in a discontented voice the plans must be examined and several
papers have to be signed

an adjutant came out and announced that everything was in readiness
within but kutúzov evidently did not wish to enter that room till he
was disengaged he made a grimace

no tell them to bring a small table out here my dear boy ill look
at them here said he dont go away he added turning to prince
andrew who remained in the porch and listened to the generals report

while this was being given prince andrew heard the whisper of a womans
voice and the rustle of a silk dress behind the door several times on
glancing that way he noticed behind that door a plump rosy handsome
woman in a pink dress with a lilac silk kerchief on her head holding a
dish and evidently awaiting the entrance of the commanderinchief
kutúzovs adjutant whispered to prince andrew that this was the wife of
the priest whose home it was and that she intended to offer his serene
highness bread and salt her husband has welcomed his serene highness
with the cross at the church and she intends to welcome him in the
house shes very pretty added the adjutant with a smile at those
words kutúzov looked round he was listening to the generals
reportwhich consisted chiefly of a criticism of the position at
tsarevozaymishcheas he had listened to denisov and seven years
previously had listened to the discussion at the austerlitz council of
war he evidently listened only because he had ears which though there
was a piece of tow in one of them could not help hearing but it was
evident that nothing the general could say would surprise or even
interest him that he knew all that would be said beforehand and heard
it all only because he had to as one has to listen to the chanting of a
service of prayer all that denisov had said was clever and to the
point what the general was saying was even more clever and to the
point but it was evident that kutúzov despised knowledge and
cleverness and knew of something else that would decide the
mattersomething independent of cleverness and knowledge prince andrew
watched the commanderinchiefs face attentively and the only
expression he could see there was one of boredom curiosity as to the
meaning of the feminine whispering behind the door and a desire to
observe propriety it was evident that kutúzov despised cleverness and
learning and even the patriotic feeling shown by denisov but despised
them not because of his own intellect feelings or knowledgehe did not
try to display any of thesebut because of something else he despised
them because of his old age and experience of life the only instruction
kutúzov gave of his own accord during that report referred to looting by
the russian troops at the end of the report the general put before him
for signature a paper relating to the recovery of payment from army
commanders for green oats mown down by the soldiers when landowners
lodged petitions for compensation

after hearing the matter kutúzov smacked his lips together and shook
his head

into the stove into the fire with it i tell you once for all my
dear fellow said he into the fire with all such things let them cut
the crops and burn wood to their hearts content i dont order it or
allow it but i dont exact compensation either one cant get on
without it when wood is chopped the chips will fly he looked at the
paper again oh this german precision he muttered shaking his head





chapter xvi

well thats all said kutúzov as he signed the last of the documents
and rising heavily and smoothing out the folds in his fat white neck he
moved toward the door with a more cheerful expression

the priests wife flushing rosy red caught up the dish she had after
all not managed to present at the right moment though she had so long
been preparing for it and with a low bow offered it to kutúzov

he screwed up his eyes smiled lifted her chin with his hand and said

ah what a beauty thank you sweetheart

he took some gold pieces from his trouser pocket and put them on the
dish for her well my dear and how are we getting on he asked
moving to the door of the room assigned to him the priests wife
smiled and with dimples in her rosy cheeks followed him into the room
the adjutant came out to the porch and asked prince andrew to lunch with
him half an hour later prince andrew was again called to kutúzov he
found him reclining in an armchair still in the same unbuttoned
overcoat he had in his hand a french book which he closed as prince
andrew entered marking the place with a knife prince andrew saw by the
cover that it was les chevaliers du cygne by madame de genlis

well sit down sit down here lets have a talk said kutúzov its
sad very sad but remember my dear fellow that i am a father to you
a second father

prince andrew told kutúzov all he knew of his fathers death and what
he had seen at bald hills when he passed through it

what what they have brought us to kutúzov suddenly cried in an
agitated voice evidently picturing vividly to himself from prince
andrews story the condition russia was in but give me time give me
time he said with a grim look evidently not wishing to continue this
agitating conversation and added i sent for you to keep you with me

i thank your serene highness but i fear i am no longer fit for the
staff replied prince andrew with a smile which kutúzov noticed

kutúzov glanced inquiringly at him

but above all added prince andrew i have grown used to my regiment
am fond of the officers and i fancy the men also like me i should be
sorry to leave the regiment if i decline the honor of being with you
believe me

a shrewd kindly yet subtly derisive expression lit up kutúzovs podgy
face he cut bolkónski short

i am sorry for i need you but youre right youre right its not
here that men are needed advisers are always plentiful but men are
not the regiments would not be what they are if the wouldbe advisers
served there as you do i remember you at austerlitz i remember
yes i remember you with the standard said kutúzov and a flush of
pleasure suffused prince andrews face at this recollection

taking his hand and drawing him downwards kutúzov offered his cheek to
be kissed and again prince andrew noticed tears in the old mans eyes
though prince andrew knew that kutúzovs tears came easily and that he
was particularly tender to and considerate of him from a wish to show
sympathy with his loss yet this reminder of austerlitz was both
pleasant and flattering to him

go your way and god be with you i know your path is the path of
honor he paused i missed you at bucharest but i needed someone to
send and changing the subject kutúzov began to speak of the turkish
war and the peace that had been concluded yes i have been much
blamed he said both for that war and the peace but everything
came at the right time tout vient a point a celui qui sait attendre
and there were as many advisers there as here he went on returning
to the subject of advisers which evidently occupied him ah those
advisers said he if we had listened to them all we should not have
made peace with turkey and should not have been through with that war
everything in haste but more haste less speed kamenski would have
been lost if he had not died he stormed fortresses with thirty thousand
men it is not difficult to capture a fortress but it is difficult to
win a campaign for that not storming and attacking but patience and
time are wanted kamenski sent soldiers to rustchuk but i only employed
these two things and took more fortresses than kamenski and made them
turks eat horseflesh he swayed his head and the french shall too
believe me he went on growing warmer and beating his chest ill
make them eat horseflesh and tears again dimmed his eyes

 everything comes in time to him who knows how to wait

but shant we have to accept battle remarked prince andrew

we shall if everybody wants it it cant be helped but believe me
my dear boy there is nothing stronger than those two patience and
time they will do it all but the advisers nentendent pas de cette
oreille voila le mal  some want a thingothers dont whats one to
do he asked evidently expecting an answer well what do you want us
to do he repeated and his eye shone with a deep shrewd look ill
tell you what to do he continued as prince andrew still did not
reply i will tell you what to do and what i do dans le doute mon
cher he paused abstienstoi he articulated the french proverb
deliberately

 dont see it that way thats the trouble

  when in doubt my dear fellow do nothing

well goodby my dear fellow remember that with all my heart i share
your sorrow and that for you i am not a serene highness nor a prince
nor a commanderinchief but a father if you want anything come
straight to me goodbye my dear boy

again he embraced and kissed prince andrew but before the latter had
left the room kutúzov gave a sigh of relief and went on with his
unfinished novel les chevaliers du cygne by madame de genlis

prince andrew could not have explained how or why it was but after that
interview with kutúzov he went back to his regiment reassured as to the
general course of affairs and as to the man to whom it had been
entrusted the more he realized the absence of all personal motive in
that old manin whom there seemed to remain only the habit of passions
and in place of an intellect grouping events and drawing conclusions
only the capacity calmly to contemplate the course of eventsthe more
reassured he was that everything would be as it should he will not
bring in any plan of his own he will not devise or undertake anything
thought prince andrew but he will hear everything remember
everything and put everything in its place he will not hinder anything
useful nor allow anything harmful he understands that there is
something stronger and more important than his own willthe inevitable
course of events and he can see them and grasp their significance and
seeing that significance can refrain from meddling and renounce his
personal wish directed to something else and above all thought prince
andrew one believes in him because hes russian despite the novel by
genlis and the french proverbs and because his voice shook when he
said what they have brought us to and had a sob in it when he said
he would make them eat horseflesh

on such feelings more or less dimly shared by all the unanimity and
general approval were founded with which despite court influences the
popular choice of kutúzov as commanderinchief was received





chapter xvii

after the emperor had left moscow life flowed on there in its usual
course and its course was so very usual that it was difficult to
remember the recent days of patriotic elation and ardor hard to believe
that russia was really in danger and that the members of the english
club were also sons of the fatherland ready to sacrifice everything for
it the one thing that recalled the patriotic fervor everyone had
displayed during the emperors stay was the call for contributions of
men and money a necessity that as soon as the promises had been made
assumed a legal official form and became unavoidable

with the enemys approach to moscow the moscovites view of their
situation did not grow more serious but on the contrary became even more
frivolous as always happens with people who see a great danger
approaching at the approach of danger there are always two voices that
speak with equal power in the human soul one very reasonably tells a
man to consider the nature of the danger and the means of escaping it
the other still more reasonably says that it is too depressing and
painful to think of the danger since it is not in mans power to
foresee everything and avert the general course of events and it is
therefore better to disregard what is painful till it comes and to
think about what is pleasant in solitude a man generally listens to the
first voice but in society to the second so it was now with the
inhabitants of moscow it was long since people had been as gay in
moscow as that year

rostopchins broadsheets headed by woodcuts of a drink shop a potman
and a moscow burgher called karpushka chigirin whohaving been a
militiaman and having had rather too much at the pubheard that napoleon
wished to come to moscow grew angry abused the french in very bad
language came out of the drink shop and under the sign of the eagle
began to address the assembled people were read and discussed
together with the latest of vasíli lvovich pushkins bouts rimes

in the corner room at the club members gathered to read these
broadsheets and some liked the way karpushka jeered at the french
saying they will swell up with russian cabbage burst with our
buckwheat porridge and choke themselves with cabbage soup they are all
dwarfs and one peasant woman will toss three of them with a hayfork
others did not like that tone and said it was stupid and vulgar it was
said that rostopchin had expelled all frenchmen and even all foreigners
from moscow and that there had been some spies and agents of napoleon
among them but this was told chiefly to introduce rostopchins witty
remark on that occasion the foreigners were deported to nizhni by boat
and rostopchin had said to them in french rentrez en vousmemes entrez
dans la barque et nen faites pas une barque de charon  there was
talk of all the government offices having been already removed from
moscow and to this shinshíns witticism was addedthat for that alone
moscow ought to be grateful to napoleon it was said that mamonovs
regiment would cost him eight hundred thousand rubles and that bezúkhov
had spent even more on his but that the best thing about bezúkhovs
action was that he himself was going to don a uniform and ride at the
head of his regiment without charging anything for the show

 think it over get into the barque and take care not to make it a
barque of charon

you dont spare anyone said julie drubetskáya as she collected and
pressed together a bunch of raveled lint with her thin beringed
fingers

julie was preparing to leave moscow next day and was giving a farewell
soiree

bezúkhov est ridicule but he is so kind and goodnatured what
pleasure is there to be so caustique

a forfeit cried a young man in militia uniform whom julie called mon
chevalier and who was going with her to nizhni

in julies set as in many other circles in moscow it had been agreed
that they would speak nothing but russian and that those who made a slip
and spoke french should pay fines to the committee of voluntary
contributions

another forfeit for a gallicism said a russian writer who was
present what pleasure is there to be is not russian

you spare no one continued julie to the young man without heeding the
authors remark

for caustiquei am guilty and will pay and i am prepared to pay again
for the pleasure of telling you the truth for gallicisms i wont be
responsible she remarked turning to the author i have neither the
money nor the time like prince galitsyn to engage a master to teach me
russian

ah here he is she added quand on no no she said to the
militia officer you wont catch me speak of the sun and you see its
rays and she smiled amiably at pierre we were just talking of you
she said with the facility in lying natural to a society woman we were
saying that your regiment would be sure to be better than mamonovs

oh dont talk to me of my regiment replied pierre kissing his
hostess hand and taking a seat beside her i am so sick of it

you will of course command it yourself said julie directing a sly
sarcastic glance toward the militia officer

the latter in pierres presence had ceased to be caustic and his face
expressed perplexity as to what julies smile might mean in spite of
his absentmindedness and good nature pierres personality immediately
checked any attempt to ridicule him to his face

no said pierre with a laughing glance at his big stout body i
should make too good a target for the french besides i am afraid i
should hardly be able to climb onto a horse

among those whom julies guests happened to choose to gossip about were
the rostóvs

i hear that their affairs are in a very bad way said julie and he
is so unreasonable the count himself i mean the razumóvskis wanted to
buy his house and his estate near moscow but it drags on and on he
asks too much

no i think the sale will come off in a few days said someone
though it is madness to buy anything in moscow now

why asked julie you dont think moscow is in danger

then why are you leaving

i what a question i am going because well because everyone is
going and besidesi am not joan of arc or an amazon

well of course of course let me have some more strips of linen

if he manages the business properly he will be able to pay off all his
debts said the militia officer speaking of rostóv

a kindly old man but not up to much and why do they stay on so long in
moscow they meant to leave for the country long ago natalie is quite
well again now isnt she julie asked pierre with a knowing smile

they are waiting for their younger son pierre replied he joined
obolenskis cossacks and went to belaya tserkov where the regiment is
being formed but now they have had him transferred to my regiment and
are expecting him every day the count wanted to leave long ago but the
countess wont on any account leave moscow till her son returns

i met them the day before yesterday at the arkhárovs natalie has
recovered her looks and is brighter she sang a song how easily some
people get over everything

get over what inquired pierre looking displeased

julie smiled

you know count such knights as you are only found in madame de
souzas novels

what knights what do you mean demanded pierre blushing

oh come my dear count cest la fable de tout moscou je vous admire
ma parole dhonneur

 it is the talk of all moscow my word i admire you

forfeit forfeit cried the militia officer

all right one cant talkhow tiresome

what is the talk of all moscow pierre asked angrily rising to his
feet

come now count you know

i dont know anything about it said pierre

i know you were friendly with natalie and so but i was always more
friendly with vérathat dear véra

no madame pierre continued in a tone of displeasure i have not
taken on myself the role of natalie rostóvas knight at all and have
not been to their house for nearly a month but i cannot understand the
cruelty

qui sexcuse saccuse  said julie smiling and waving the lint
triumphantly and to have the last word she promptly changed the
subject do you know what i heard today poor mary bolkónskaya arrived
in moscow yesterday do you know that she has lost her father

 who excuses himself accuses himself

really where is she i should like very much to see her said pierre

i spent the evening with her yesterday she is going to their estate
near moscow either today or tomorrow morning with her nephew

well and how is she asked pierre

she is well but sad but do you know who rescued her it is quite a
romance nicholas rostóv she was surrounded and they wanted to kill
her and had wounded some of her people he rushed in and saved her

another romance said the militia officer really this general
flight has been arranged to get all the old maids married off catiche
is one and princess bolkónskaya another

do you know i really believe she is un petit peu amoureuse du jeune
homme

 a little bit in love with the young man

forfeit forfeit forfeit

but how could one say that in russian





chapter xviii

when pierre returned home he was handed two of rostopchins broadsheets
that had been brought that day

the first declared that the report that count rostopchin had forbidden
people to leave moscow was false on the contrary he was glad that
ladies and tradesmens wives were leaving the city there will be less
panic and less gossip ran the broadsheet but i will stake my life on
it that scoundrel will not enter moscow these words showed pierre
clearly for the first time that the french would enter moscow the
second broadsheet stated that our headquarters were at vyazma that
count wittgenstein had defeated the french but that as many of the
inhabitants of moscow wished to be armed weapons were ready for them at
the arsenal sabers pistols and muskets which could be had at a low
price the tone of the proclamation was not as jocose as in the former
chigirin talks pierre pondered over these broadsheets evidently the
terrible stormcloud he had desired with the whole strength of his soul
but which yet aroused involuntary horror in him was drawing near

shall i join the army and enter the service or wait he asked himself
for the hundredth time he took a pack of cards that lay on the table
and began to lay them out for a game of patience

if this patience comes out he said to himself after shuffling the
cards holding them in his hand and lifting his head if it comes out
it means what does it mean

he had not decided what it should mean when he heard the voice of the
eldest princess at the door asking whether she might come in

then it will mean that i must go to the army said pierre to himself
come in come in he added to the princess

only the eldest princess the one with the stony face and long waist
was still living in pierres house the two younger ones had both
married

excuse my coming to you cousin she said in a reproachful and
agitated voice you know some decision must be come to what is going
to happen everyone has left moscow and the people are rioting how is
it that we are staying on

on the contrary things seem satisfactory ma cousine said pierre in
the bantering tone he habitually adopted toward her always feeling
uncomfortable in the role of her benefactor

satisfactory indeed very satisfactory barbara ivánovna told me today
how our troops are distinguishing themselves it certainly does them
credit and the people too are quite mutinousthey no longer obey even
my maid has taken to being rude at this rate they will soon begin
beating us one cant walk in the streets but above all the french
will be here any day now so what are we waiting for i ask just one
thing of you cousin she went on arrange for me to be taken to
petersburg whatever i may be i cant live under bonapartes rule

oh come ma cousine where do you get your information from on the
contrary

i wont submit to your napoleon others may if they please if you
dont want to do this

but i will ill give the order at once

the princess was apparently vexed at not having anyone to be angry with
muttering to herself she sat down on a chair

but you have been misinformed said pierre everything is quiet in
the city and there is not the slightest danger see ive just been
reading he showed her the broadsheet count rostopchin writes that
he will stake his life on it that the enemy will not enter moscow

oh that count of yours said the princess malevolently he is a
hypocrite a rascal who has himself roused the people to riot didnt he
write in those idiotic broadsheets that anyone whoever it might be
should be dragged to the lockup by his hair how silly and honor
and glory to whoever captures him he says this is what his cajolery
has brought us to barbara ivánovna told me the mob near killed her
because she said something in french

oh but its so you take everything so to heart said pierre and
began laying out his cards for patience

although that patience did come out pierre did not join the army but
remained in deserted moscow ever in the same state of agitation
irresolution and alarm yet at the same time joyfully expecting
something terrible

next day toward evening the princess set off and pierres head steward
came to inform him that the money needed for the equipment of his
regiment could not be found without selling one of the estates in
general the head steward made out to pierre that his project of raising
a regiment would ruin him pierre listened to him scarcely able to
repress a smile

well then sell it said he whats to be done i cant draw back
now

the worse everything became especially his own affairs the better was
pierre pleased and the more evident was it that the catastrophe he
expected was approaching hardly anyone he knew was left in town julie
had gone and so had princess mary of his intimate friends only the
rostóvs remained but he did not go to see them

to distract his thoughts he drove that day to the village of vorontsovo
to see the great balloon leppich was constructing to destroy the foe
and a trial balloon that was to go up next day the balloon was not yet
ready but pierre learned that it was being constructed by the emperors
desire the emperor had written to count rostopchin as follows

as soon as leppich is ready get together a crew of reliable and
intelligent men for his car and send a courier to general kutúzov to let
him know i have informed him of the matter

please impress upon leppich to be very careful where he descends for the
first time that he may not make a mistake and fall into the enemys
hands it is essential for him to combine his movements with those of
the commanderinchief

on his way home from vorontsovo as he was passing the bolotnoe place
pierre seeing a large crowd round the lobnoe place stopped and got out
of his trap a french cook accused of being a spy was being flogged the
flogging was only just over and the executioner was releasing from the
flogging bench a stout man with red whiskers in blue stockings and a
green jacket who was moaning piteously another criminal thin and
pale stood near judging by their faces they were both frenchmen with
a frightened and suffering look resembling that on the thin frenchmans
face pierre pushed his way in through the crowd

what is it who is it what is it for he kept asking

but the attention of the crowdofficials burghers shopkeepers
peasants and women in cloaks and in pelisseswas so eagerly centered on
what was passing in lobnoe place that no one answered him the stout man
rose frowned shrugged his shoulders and evidently trying to appear
firm began to pull on his jacket without looking about him but suddenly
his lips trembled and he began to cry in the way fullblooded grownup
men cry though angry with himself for doing so in the crowd people
began talking loudly to stifle their feelings of pity as it seemed to
pierre

hes cook to some prince

eh mounseer russian sauce seems to be sour to a frenchman sets his
teeth on edge said a wrinkled clerk who was standing behind pierre
when the frenchman began to cry

the clerk glanced round evidently hoping that his joke would be
appreciated some people began to laugh others continued to watch in
dismay the executioner who was undressing the other man

pierre choked his face puckered and he turned hastily away went back
to his trap muttering something to himself as he went and took his
seat as they drove along he shuddered and exclaimed several times so
audibly that the coachman asked him

what is your pleasure

where are you going shouted pierre to the man who was driving to
lubyanka street

to the governors as you ordered answered the coachman

fool idiot shouted pierre abusing his coachmana thing he rarely
did home i told you and drive faster blockhead i must get away
this very day he murmured to himself

at the sight of the tortured frenchman and the crowd surrounding the
lobnoe place pierre had so definitely made up his mind that he could no
longer remain in moscow and would leave for the army that very day that
it seemed to him that either he had told the coachman this or that the
man ought to have known it for himself

on reaching home pierre gave orders to evstafeyhis head coachman who
knew everything could do anything and was known to all moscowthat he
would leave that night for the army at mozhaysk and that his saddle
horses should be sent there this could not all be arranged that day so
on evstafeys representation pierre had to put off his departure till
next day to allow time for the relay horses to be sent on in advance

on the twentyfourth the weather cleared up after a spell of rain and
after dinner pierre left moscow when changing horses that night in
perkhushkovo he learned that there had been a great battle that
evening this was the battle of shevardino he was told that there in
perkhushkovo the earth trembled from the firing but nobody could answer
his questions as to who had won at dawn next day pierre was approaching
mozhaysk

every house in mozhaysk had soldiers quartered in it and at the hostel
where pierre was met by his groom and coachman there was no room to be
had it was full of officers

everywhere in mozhaysk and beyond it troops were stationed or on the
march cossacks foot and horse soldiers wagons caissons and cannon
were everywhere pierre pushed forward as fast as he could and the
farther he left moscow behind and the deeper he plunged into that sea of
troops the more was he overcome by restless agitation and a new and
joyful feeling he had not experienced before it was a feeling akin to
what he had felt at the sloboda palace during the emperors visita
sense of the necessity of undertaking something and sacrificing
something he now experienced a glad consciousness that everything that
constitutes mens happinessthe comforts of life wealth even life
itselfis rubbish it is pleasant to throw away compared with
something with what pierre could not say and he did not try to
determine for whom and for what he felt such particular delight in
sacrificing everything he was not occupied with the question of what to
sacrifice for the fact of sacrificing in itself afforded him a new and
joyous sensation





chapter xix

on the twentyfourth of august the battle of the shevardino redoubt was
fought on the twentyfifth not a shot was fired by either side and on
the twentysixth the battle of borodino itself took place

why and how were the battles of shevardino and borodino given and
accepted why was the battle of borodino fought there was not the least
sense in it for either the french or the russians its immediate result
for the russians was and was bound to be that we were brought nearer
to the destruction of moscowwhich we feared more than anything in the
world and for the french its immediate result was that they were
brought nearer to the destruction of their whole armywhich they feared
more than anything in the world what the result must be was quite
obvious and yet napoleon offered and kutúzov accepted that battle

if the commanders had been guided by reason it would seem that it must
have been obvious to napoleon that by advancing thirteen hundred miles
and giving battle with a probability of losing a quarter of his army he
was advancing to certain destruction and it must have been equally
clear to kutúzov that by accepting battle and risking the loss of a
quarter of his army he would certainly lose moscow for kutúzov this was
mathematically clear as it is that if when playing draughts i have one
man less and go on exchanging i shall certainly lose and therefore
should not exchange when my opponent has sixteen men and i have
fourteen i am only one eighth weaker than he but when i have exchanged
thirteen more men he will be three times as strong as i am

before the battle of borodino our strength in proportion to the french
was about as five to six but after that battle it was little more than
one to two previously we had a hundred thousand against a hundred and
twenty thousand afterwards little more than fifty thousand against a
hundred thousand yet the shrewd and experienced kutúzov accepted the
battle while napoleon who was said to be a commander of genius gave
it losing a quarter of his army and lengthening his lines of
communication still more if it is said that he expected to end the
campaign by occupying moscow as he had ended a previous campaign by
occupying vienna there is much evidence to the contrary napoleons
historians themselves tell us that from smolensk onwards he wished to
stop knew the danger of his extended position and knew that the
occupation of moscow would not be the end of the campaign for he had
seen at smolensk the state in which russian towns were left to him and
had not received a single reply to his repeated announcements of his
wish to negotiate

in giving and accepting battle at borodino kutúzov acted involuntarily
and irrationally but later on to fit what had occurred the historians
provided cunningly devised evidence of the foresight and genius of the
generals who of all the blind tools of history were the most enslaved
and involuntary

the ancients have left us model heroic poems in which the heroes furnish
the whole interest of the story and we are still unable to accustom
ourselves to the fact that for our epoch histories of that kind are
meaningless

on the other question how the battle of borodino and the preceding
battle of shevardino were fought there also exists a definite and well
known but quite false conception all the historians describe the
affair as follows

the russian army they say in its retreat from smolensk sought out for
itself the best position for a general engagement and found such a
position at borodino

the russians they say fortified this position in advance on the left
of the highroad from moscow to smolensk and almost at a right angle to
it from borodino to utitsa at the very place where the battle was
fought

in front of this position they say a fortified outpost was set up on
the shevardino mound to observe the enemy on the twentyfourth we are
told napoleon attacked this advanced post and took it and on the
twentysixth attacked the whole russian army which was in position on
the field of borodino

so the histories say and it is all quite wrong as anyone who cares to
look into the matter can easily convince himself

the russians did not seek out the best position but on the contrary
during the retreat passed many positions better than borodino they did
not stop at any one of these positions because kutúzov did not wish to
occupy a position he had not himself chosen because the popular demand
for a battle had not yet expressed itself strongly enough and because
miloradovich had not yet arrived with the militia and for many other
reasons the fact is that other positions they had passed were stronger
and that the position at borodino the one where the battle was fought
far from being strong was no more a position than any other spot one
might find in the russian empire by sticking a pin into the map at
hazard

not only did the russians not fortify the position on the field of
borodino to the left of and at a right angle to the highroad that is
the position on which the battle took place but never till the twenty
fifth of august  did they think that a battle might be fought
there this was shown first by the fact that there were no entrenchments
there by the twenty fifth and that those begun on the twentyfifth and
twentysixth were not completed and secondly by the position of the
shevardino redoubt that redoubt was quite senseless in front of the
position where the battle was accepted why was it more strongly
fortified than any other post and why were all efforts exhausted and
six thousand men sacrificed to defend it till late at night on the
twentyfourth a cossack patrol would have sufficed to observe the
enemy thirdly as proof that the position on which the battle was
fought had not been foreseen and that the shevardino redoubt was not an
advanced post of that position we have the fact that up to the twenty
fifth barclay de tolly and bagration were convinced that the shevardino
redoubt was the left flank of the position and that kutúzov himself in
his report written in hot haste after the battle speaks of the
shevardino redoubt as the left flank of the position it was much later
when reports on the battle of borodino were written at leisure that the
incorrect and extraordinary statement was invented probably to justify
the mistakes of a commanderinchief who had to be represented as
infallible that the shevardino redoubt was an advanced postwhereas in
reality it was simply a fortified point on the left flankand that the
battle of borodino was fought by us on an entrenched position previously
selected where as it was fought on a quite unexpected spot which was
almost unentrenched

the case was evidently this a position was selected along the river
kolochawhich crosses the highroad not at a right angle but at an acute
angleso that the left flank was at shevardino the right flank near the
village of novoe and the center at borodino at the confluence of the
rivers kolocha and voyna

to anyone who looks at the field of borodino without thinking of how the
battle was actually fought this position protected by the river
kolocha presents itself as obvious for an army whose object was to
prevent an enemy from advancing along the smolensk road to moscow

napoleon riding to valuevo on the twentyfourth did not see as the
history books say he did the position of the russians from utitsa to
borodino he could not have seen that position because it did not
exist nor did he see an advanced post of the russian army but while
pursuing the russian rearguard he came upon the left flank of the
russian positionat the shevardino redoubtand unexpectedly for the
russians moved his army across the kolocha and the russians not having
time to begin a general engagement withdrew their left wing from the
position they had intended to occupy and took up a new position which
had not been foreseen and was not fortified by crossing to the other
side of the kolocha to the left of the highroad napoleon shifted the
whole forthcoming battle from right to left looking from the russian
side and transferred it to the plain between utitsa semënovsk and
borodinoa plain no more advantageous as a position than any other plain
in russiaand there the whole battle of the twentysixth of august took
place

had napoleon not ridden out on the evening of the twentyfourth to the
kolocha and had he not then ordered an immediate attack on the redoubt
but had begun the attack next morning no one would have doubted that
the shevardino redoubt was the left flank of our position and the
battle would have taken place where we expected it in that case we
should probably have defended the shevardino redoubtour left
flankstill more obstinately we should have attacked napoleon in the
center or on the right and the engagement would have taken place on the
twentyfifth in the position we intended and had fortified but as the
attack on our left flank took place in the evening after the retreat of
our rear guard that is immediately after the fight at gridneva and
as the russian commanders did not wish or were not in time to begin a
general engagement then on the evening of the twentyfourth the first
and chief action of the battle of borodino was already lost on the
twentyfourth and obviously led to the loss of the one fought on the
twentysixth

after the loss of the shevardino redoubt we found ourselves on the
morning of the twentyfifth without a position for our left flank and
were forced to bend it back and hastily entrench it where it chanced to
be

not only was the russian army on the twentysixth defended by weak
unfinished entrenchments but the disadvantage of that position was
increased by the fact that the russian commandersnot having fully
realized what had happened namely the loss of our position on the left
flank and the shifting of the whole field of the forthcoming battle from
right to leftmaintained their extended position from the village of
novoe to utitsa and consequently had to move their forces from right to
left during the battle so it happened that throughout the whole battle
the russians opposed the entire french army launched against our left
flank with but half as many men poniatowskis action against utitsa
and uvarovs on the right flank against the french were actions
distinct from the main course of the battle so the battle of borodino
did not take place at all as in an effort to conceal our commanders
mistakes even at the cost of diminishing the glory due to the russian
army and people it has been described the battle of borodino was not
fought on a chosen and entrenched position with forces only slightly
weaker than those of the enemy but as a result of the loss of the
shevardino redoubt the russians fought the battle of borodino on an
open and almost unentrenched position with forces only half as numerous
as the french that is to say under conditions in which it was not
merely unthinkable to fight for ten hours and secure an indecisive
result but unthinkable to keep an army even from complete
disintegration and flight





chapter xx

on the morning of the twentyfifth pierre was leaving mozhaysk at the
descent of the high steep hill down which a winding road led out of the
town past the cathedral on the right where a service was being held and
the bells were ringing pierre got out of his vehicle and proceeded on
foot behind him a cavalry regiment was coming down the hill preceded by
its singers coming up toward him was a train of carts carrying men who
had been wounded in the engagement the day before the peasant drivers
shouting and lashing their horses kept crossing from side to side the
carts in each of which three or four wounded soldiers were lying or
sitting jolted over the stones that had been thrown on the steep
incline to make it something like a road the wounded bandaged with
rags with pale cheeks compressed lips and knitted brows held on to
the sides of the carts as they were jolted against one another almost
all of them stared with naïve childlike curiosity at pierres white hat
and green swallowtail coat

pierres coachman shouted angrily at the convoy of wounded to keep to
one side of the road the cavalry regiment as it descended the hill
with its singers surrounded pierres carriage and blocked the road
pierre stopped being pressed against the side of the cutting in which
the road ran the sunshine from behind the hill did not penetrate into
the cutting and there it was cold and damp but above pierres head was
the bright august sunshine and the bells sounded merrily one of the
carts with wounded stopped by the side of the road close to pierre the
driver in his bast shoes ran panting up to it placed a stone under one
of its tireless hind wheels and began arranging the breechband on his
little horse

one of the wounded an old soldier with a bandaged arm who was following
the cart on foot caught hold of it with his sound hand and turned to
look at pierre

i say fellow countryman will they set us down here or take us on to
moscow he asked

pierre was so deep in thought that he did not hear the question he was
looking now at the cavalry regiment that had met the convoy of wounded
now at the cart by which he was standing in which two wounded men were
sitting and one was lying one of those sitting up in the cart had
probably been wounded in the cheek his whole head was wrapped in rags
and one cheek was swollen to the size of a babys head his nose and
mouth were twisted to one side this soldier was looking at the
cathedral and crossing himself another a young lad a fairhaired
recruit as white as though there was no blood in his thin face looked
at pierre kindly with a fixed smile the third lay prone so that his
face was not visible the cavalry singers were passing close by

ah lost quite lost is my head so keen living in a foreign land

they sang their soldiers dance song

as if responding to them but with a different sort of merriment the
metallic sound of the bells reverberated high above and the hot rays of
the sun bathed the top of the opposite slope with yet another sort of
merriment but beneath the slope by the cart with the wounded near the
panting little nag where pierre stood it was damp somber and sad

the soldier with the swollen cheek looked angrily at the cavalry
singers

oh the coxcombs he muttered reproachfully

its not the soldiers only but ive seen peasants today too the
peasantseven they have to go said the soldier behind the cart
addressing pierre with a sad smile no distinctions made nowadays
they want the whole nation to fall on themin a word its moscow they
want to make an end of it

in spite of the obscurity of the soldiers words pierre understood what
he wanted to say and nodded approval

the road was clear again pierre descended the hill and drove on

he kept looking to either side of the road for familiar faces but only
saw everywhere the unfamiliar faces of various military men of different
branches of the service who all looked with astonishment at his white
hat and green tail coat

having gone nearly three miles he at last met an acquaintance and
eagerly addressed him this was one of the head army doctors he was
driving toward pierre in a covered gig sitting beside a young surgeon
and on recognizing pierre he told the cossack who occupied the drivers
seat to pull up

count your excellency how come you to be here asked the doctor

well you know i wanted to see

yes yes there will be something to see

pierre got out and talked to the doctor explaining his intention of
taking part in a battle

the doctor advised him to apply direct to kutúzov

why should you be god knows where out of sight during the battle he
said exchanging glances with his young companion anyhow his serene
highness knows you and will receive you graciously thats what you must
do

the doctor seemed tired and in a hurry

you think so ah i also wanted to ask you where our position is
exactly said pierre

the position repeated the doctor well thats not my line drive
past tatarinova a lot of digging is going on there go up the hillock
and youll see

can one see from there if you would

but the doctor interrupted him and moved toward his gig

i would go with you but on my honor im up to hereand he pointed to
his throat im galloping to the commander of the corps how do matters
stand you know count therell be a battle tomorrow out of an army
of a hundred thousand we must expect at least twenty thousand wounded
and we havent stretchers or bunks or dressers or doctors enough for
six thousand we have ten thousand carts but we need other things as
wellwe must manage as best we can

the strange thought that of the thousands of men young and old who had
stared with merry surprise at his hat perhaps the very men he had
noticed twenty thousand were inevitably doomed to wounds and death
amazed pierre

they may die tomorrow why are they thinking of anything but death
and by some latent sequence of thought the descent of the mozhaysk hill
the carts with the wounded the ringing bells the slanting rays of the
sun and the songs of the cavalrymen vividly recurred to his mind

the cavalry ride to battle and meet the wounded and do not for a moment
think of what awaits them but pass by winking at the wounded yet from
among these men twenty thousand are doomed to die and they wonder at my
hat strange thought pierre continuing his way to tatarinova

in front of a landowners house to the left of the road stood carriages
wagons and crowds of orderlies and sentinels the commanderinchief
was putting up there but just when pierre arrived he was not in and
hardly any of the staff were therethey had gone to the church service
pierre drove on toward gorki

when he had ascended the hill and reached the little village street he
saw for the first time peasant militiamen in their white shirts and with
crosses on their caps who talking and laughing loudly animated and
perspiring were at work on a huge knoll overgrown with grass to the
right of the road

some of them were digging others were wheeling barrowloads of earth
along planks while others stood about doing nothing

two officers were standing on the knoll directing the men on seeing
these peasants who were evidently still amused by the novelty of their
position as soldiers pierre once more thought of the wounded men at
mozhaysk and understood what the soldier had meant when he said they
want the whole nation to fall on them the sight of these bearded
peasants at work on the battlefield with their queer clumsy boots and
perspiring necks and their shirts opening from the left toward the
middle unfastened exposing their sunburned collarbones impressed
pierre more strongly with the solemnity and importance of the moment
than anything he had yet seen or heard





chapter xxi

pierre stepped out of his carriage and passing the toiling militiamen
ascended the knoll from which according to the doctor the battlefield
could be seen

it was about eleven oclock the sun shone somewhat to the left and
behind him and brightly lit up the enormous panorama which rising like
an amphitheater extended before him in the clear rarefied atmosphere

from above on the left bisecting that amphitheater wound the smolensk
highroad passing through a village with a white church some five
hundred paces in front of the knoll and below it this was borodino
below the village the road crossed the river by a bridge and winding
down and up rose higher and higher to the village of valuevo visible
about four miles away where napoleon was then stationed beyond valuevo
the road disappeared into a yellowing forest on the horizon far in the
distance in that birch and fir forest to the right of the road the
cross and belfry of the kolocha monastery gleamed in the sun here and
there over the whole of that blue expanse to right and left of the
forest and the road smoking campfires could be seen and indefinite
masses of troopsours and the enemys the ground to the rightalong the
course of the kolocha and moskva riverswas broken and hilly between
the hollows the villages of bezúbova and zakharino showed in the
distance on the left the ground was more level there were fields of
grain and the smoking ruins of semënovsk which had been burned down
could be seen

all that pierre saw was so indefinite that neither the left nor the
right side of the field fully satisfied his expectations nowhere could
he see the battlefield he had expected to find but only fields
meadows troops woods the smoke of campfires villages mounds and
streams and try as he would he could descry no military position in
this place which teemed with life nor could he even distinguish our
troops from the enemys

i must ask someone who knows he thought and addressed an officer who
was looking with curiosity at his huge unmilitary figure

may i ask you said pierre what village that is in front

burdino isnt it said the officer turning to his companion

borodino the other corrected him

the officer evidently glad of an opportunity for a talk moved up to
pierre

are those our men there pierre inquired

yes and there further on are the french said the officer there
they are there you can see them

where where asked pierre

one can see them with the naked eye why there

the officer pointed with his hand to the smoke visible on the left
beyond the river and the same stern and serious expression that pierre
had noticed on many of the faces he had met came into his face

ah those are the french and over there pierre pointed to a knoll
on the left near which some troops could be seen

those are ours

ah ours and there pierre pointed to another knoll in the
distance with a big tree on it near a village that lay in a hollow
where also some campfires were smoking and something black was visible

thats his again said the officer it was the shevardino redoubt
it was ours yesterday but now it is his

then how about our position

our position replied the officer with a smile of satisfaction i can
tell you quite clearly because i constructed nearly all our
entrenchments there you see theres our center at borodino just
there and he pointed to the village in front of them with the white
church thats where one crosses the kolocha you see down there where
the rows of hay are lying in the hollow theres the bridge thats our
center our right flank is over therehe pointed sharply to the right
far away in the broken groundthats where the moskva river is and we
have thrown up three redoubts there very strong ones the left
flank here the officer paused well you see thats difficult to
explain yesterday our left flank was there at shevardino you see
where the oak is but now we have withdrawn our left wingnow it is over
there do you see that village and the smoke thats semënovsk yes
there he pointed to raevskis knoll but the battle will hardly be
there his having moved his troops there is only a ruse he will
probably pass round to the right of the moskva but wherever it may be
many a man will be missing tomorrow he remarked

an elderly sergeant who had approached the officer while he was giving
these explanations had waited in silence for him to finish speaking but
at this point evidently not liking the officers remark interrupted
him

gabions must be sent for said he sternly

the officer appeared abashed as though he understood that one might
think of how many men would be missing tomorrow but ought not to speak
of it

well send number three company again the officer replied hurriedly

and you are you one of the doctors

no ive come on my own answered pierre and he went down the hill
again passing the militiamen

oh those damned fellows muttered the officer who followed him
holding his nose as he ran past the men at work

there they are bringing her coming there they are theyll be
here in a minute voices were suddenly heard saying and officers
soldiers and militiamen began running forward along the road

a church procession was coming up the hill from borodino first along
the dusty road came the infantry in ranks bareheaded and with arms
reversed from behind them came the sound of church singing

soldiers and militiamen ran bareheaded past pierre toward the
procession

they are bringing her our protectress the iberian mother of god
someone cried

the smolensk mother of god another corrected him

the militiamen both those who had been in the village and those who had
been at work on the battery threw down their spades and ran to meet the
church procession following the battalion that marched along the dusty
road came priests in their vestmentsone little old man in a hood with
attendants and singers behind them soldiers and officers bore a large
darkfaced icon with an embossed metal cover this was the icon that had
been brought from smolensk and had since accompanied the army behind
before and on both sides crowds of militiamen with bared heads walked
ran and bowed to the ground

at the summit of the hill they stopped with the icon the men who had
been holding it up by the linen bands attached to it were relieved by
others the chanters relit their censers and service began the hot
rays of the sun beat down vertically and a fresh soft wind played with
the hair of the bared heads and with the ribbons decorating the icon
the singing did not sound loud under the open sky an immense crowd of
bareheaded officers soldiers and militiamen surrounded the icon
behind the priest and a chanter stood the notabilities on a spot
reserved for them a bald general with a st georges cross on his neck
stood just behind the priests back and without crossing himself he
was evidently a german patiently awaited the end of the service which
he considered it necessary to hear to the end probably to arouse the
patriotism of the russian people another general stood in a martial
pose crossing himself by shaking his hand in front of his chest while
looking about him standing among the crowd of peasants pierre
recognized several acquaintances among these notables but did not look
at themhis whole attention was absorbed in watching the serious
expression on the faces of the crowd of soldiers and militiamen who were
all gazing eagerly at the icon as soon as the tired chanters who were
singing the service for the twentieth time that day began lazily and
mechanically to sing save from calamity thy servants o mother of
god and the priest and deacon chimed in for to thee under god we all
flee as to an inviolable bulwark and protection there again kindled in
all those faces the same expression of consciousness of the solemnity of
the impending moment that pierre had seen on the faces at the foot of
the hill at mozhaysk and momentarily on many and many faces he had met
that morning and heads were bowed more frequently and hair tossed back
and sighs and the sound men made as they crossed themselves were heard

the crowd round the icon suddenly parted and pressed against pierre
someone a very important personage judging by the haste with which way
was made for him was approaching the icon

it was kutúzov who had been riding round the position and on his way
back to tatarinova had stopped where the service was being held pierre
recognized him at once by his peculiar figure which distinguished him
from everybody else

with a long overcoat on his exceedingly stout roundshouldered body
with uncovered white head and puffy face showing the white ball of the
eye he had lost kutúzov walked with plunging swaying gait into the
crowd and stopped behind the priest he crossed himself with an
accustomed movement bent till he touched the ground with his hand and
bowed his white head with a deep sigh behind kutúzov was bennigsen and
the suite despite the presence of the commanderinchief who attracted
the attention of all the superior officers the militiamen and soldiers
continued their prayers without looking at him

when the service was over kutúzov stepped up to the icon sank heavily
to his knees bowed to the ground and for a long time tried vainly to
rise but could not do so on account of his weakness and weight his
white head twitched with the effort at last he rose kissed the icon as
a child does with naïvely pouting lips and again bowed till he touched
the ground with his hand the other generals followed his example then
the officers and after them with excited faces pressing on one
another crowding panting and pushing scrambled the soldiers and
militiamen





chapter xxii

staggering amid the crush pierre looked about him

count peter kirilovich how did you get here said a voice

pierre looked round borís drubetskóy brushing his knees with his hand
he had probably soiled them when he too had knelt before the icon
came up to him smiling borís was elegantly dressed with a slightly
martial touch appropriate to a campaign he wore a long coat and like
kutúzov had a whip slung across his shoulder

meanwhile kutúzov had reached the village and seated himself in the
shade of the nearest house on a bench which one cossack had run to
fetch and another had hastily covered with a rug an immense and
brilliant suite surrounded him

the icon was carried further accompanied by the throng pierre stopped
some thirty paces from kutúzov talking to borís

he explained his wish to be present at the battle and to see the
position

this is what you must do said borís i will do the honors of the
camp to you you will see everything best from where count bennigsen
will be i am in attendance on him you know ill mention it to him
but if you want to ride round the position come along with us we are
just going to the left flank then when we get back do spend the night
with me and well arrange a game of cards of course you know dmítri
sergéevich those are his quarters and he pointed to the third house
in the village of gorki

but i should like to see the right flank they say its very strong
said pierre i should like to start from the moskva river and ride
round the whole position

well you can do that later but the chief thing is the left flank

yes yes but where is prince bolkónskis regiment can you point it
out to me

prince andrews we shall pass it and ill take you to him

what about the left flank asked pierre

to tell you the truth between ourselves god only knows what state our
left flank is in said borís confidentially lowering his voice it is
not at all what count bennigsen intended he meant to fortify that knoll
quite differently but borís shrugged his shoulders his serene
highness would not have it or someone persuaded him you see but
borís did not finish for at that moment kaysarov kutúzovs adjutant
came up to pierre ah kaysarov said borís addressing him with an
unembarrassed smile i was just trying to explain our position to the
count it is amazing how his serene highness could so foresee the
intentions of the french

you mean the left flank asked kaysarov

yes exactly the left flank is now extremely strong

though kutúzov had dismissed all unnecessary men from the staff borís
had contrived to remain at headquarters after the changes he had
established himself with count bennigsen who like all on whom borís
had been in attendance considered young prince drubetskóy an invaluable
man

in the higher command there were two sharply defined parties kutúzovs
party and that of bennigsen the chief of staff borís belonged to the
latter and no one else while showing servile respect to kutúzov could
so create an impression that the old fellow was not much good and that
bennigsen managed everything now the decisive moment of battle had come
when kutúzov would be destroyed and the power pass to bennigsen or even
if kutúzov won the battle it would be felt that everything was done by
bennigsen in any case many great rewards would have to be given for
tomorrows action and new men would come to the front so borís was
full of nervous vivacity all day

after kaysarov others whom pierre knew came up to him and he had not
time to reply to all the questions about moscow that were showered upon
him or to listen to all that was told him the faces all expressed
animation and apprehension but it seemed to pierre that the cause of
the excitement shown in some of these faces lay chiefly in questions of
personal success his mind however was occupied by the different
expression he saw on other facesan expression that spoke not of
personal matters but of the universal questions of life and death
kutúzov noticed pierres figure and the group gathered round him

call him to me said kutúzov

an adjutant told pierre of his serene highness wish and pierre went
toward kutúzovs bench but a militiaman got there before him it was
dólokhov

how did that fellow get here asked pierre

hes a creature that wriggles in anywhere was the answer he has
been degraded you know now he wants to bob up again hes been
proposing some scheme or other and has crawled into the enemys picket
line at night hes a brave fellow

pierre took off his hat and bowed respectfully to kutúzov

i concluded that if i reported to your serene highness you might send
me away or say that you knew what i was reporting but then i shouldnt
lose anything dólokhov was saying

yes yes

but if i were right i should be rendering a service to my fatherland
for which i am ready to die

yes yes

and should your serene highness require a man who will not spare his
skin please think of me perhaps i may prove useful to your serene
highness

yes yes kutúzov repeated his laughing eye narrowing more and
more as he looked at pierre

just then borís with his courtierlike adroitness stepped up to
pierres side near kutúzov and in a most natural manner without raising
his voice said to pierre as though continuing an interrupted
conversation

the militia have put on clean white shirts to be ready to die what
heroism count

borís evidently said this to pierre in order to be overheard by his
serene highness he knew kutúzovs attention would be caught by those
words and so it was

what are you saying about the militia he asked borís

preparing for tomorrow your serene highnessfor deaththey have put on
clean shirts

ah a wonderful a matchless people said kutúzov and he closed his
eyes and swayed his head a matchless people he repeated with a sigh

so you want to smell gunpowder he said to pierre yes its a
pleasant smell i have the honor to be one of your wifes adorers is
she well my quarters are at your service

and as often happens with old people kutúzov began looking about
absentmindedly as if forgetting all he wanted to say or do

then evidently remembering what he wanted he beckoned to andrew
kaysarov his adjutants brother

those verses those verses of marins how do they go eh those he
wrote about gerakov lectures for the corps inditing recite them
recite them said he evidently preparing to laugh

kaysarov recited kutúzov smilingly nodded his head to the rhythm of
the verses

when pierre had left kutúzov dólokhov came up to him and took his hand

i am very glad to meet you here count he said aloud regardless of
the presence of strangers and in a particularly resolute and solemn
tone on the eve of a day when god alone knows who of us is fated to
survive i am glad of this opportunity to tell you that i regret the
misunderstandings that occurred between us and should wish you not to
have any ill feeling for me i beg you to forgive me

pierre looked at dólokhov with a smile not knowing what to say to him
with tears in his eyes dólokhov embraced pierre and kissed him

borís said a few words to his general and count bennigsen turned to
pierre and proposed that he should ride with him along the line

it will interest you said he

yes very much replied pierre

half an hour later kutúzov left for tatarinova and bennigsen and his
suite with pierre among them set out on their ride along the line





chapter xxiii

from gorki bennigsen descended the highroad to the bridge which when
they had looked at it from the hill the officer had pointed out as
being the center of our position and where rows of fragrant newmown hay
lay by the riverside they rode across that bridge into the village of
borodino and thence turned to the left passing an enormous number of
troops and guns and came to a high knoll where militiamen were digging
this was the redoubt as yet unnamed which afterwards became known as
the raevski redoubt or the knoll battery but pierre paid no special
attention to it he did not know that it would become more memorable to
him than any other spot on the plain of borodino

they then crossed the hollow to semënovsk where the soldiers were
dragging away the last logs from the huts and barns then they rode
downhill and uphill across a ryefield trodden and beaten down as if by
hail following a track freshly made by the artillery over the furrows
of the plowed land and reached some fleches  which were still being
dug

 a kind of entrenchment

at the fleches bennigsen stopped and began looking at the shevardino
redoubt opposite which had been ours the day before and where several
horsemen could be descried the officers said that either napoleon or
murat was there and they all gazed eagerly at this little group of
horsemen pierre also looked at them trying to guess which of the
scarcely discernible figures was napoleon at last those mounted men
rode away from the mound and disappeared

bennigsen spoke to a general who approached him and began explaining
the whole position of our troops pierre listened to him straining each
faculty to understand the essential points of the impending battle but
was mortified to feel that his mental capacity was inadequate for the
task he could make nothing of it bennigsen stopped speaking and
noticing that pierre was listening suddenly said to him

i dont think this interests you

on the contrary its very interesting replied pierre not quite
truthfully

from the fleches they rode still farther to the left along a road
winding through a thick lowgrowing birch wood in the middle of the
wood a brown hare with white feet sprang out and scared by the tramp of
the many horses grew so confused that it leaped along the road in front
of them for some time arousing general attention and laughter and only
when several voices shouted at it did it dart to one side and disappear
in the thicket after going through the wood for about a mile and a half
they came out on a glade where troops of tuchkovs corps were stationed
to defend the left flank

here at the extreme left flank bennigsen talked a great deal and with
much heat and as it seemed to pierre gave orders of great military
importance in front of tuchkovs troops was some high ground not
occupied by troops bennigsen loudly criticized this mistake saying
that it was madness to leave a height which commanded the country around
unoccupied and to place troops below it some of the generals expressed
the same opinion one in particular declared with martial heat that they
were put there to be slaughtered bennigsen on his own authority ordered
the troops to occupy the high ground this disposition on the left flank
increased pierres doubt of his own capacity to understand military
matters listening to bennigsen and the generals criticizing the
position of the troops behind the hill he quite understood them and
shared their opinion but for that very reason he could not understand
how the man who put them there behind the hill could have made so gross
and palpable a blunder

pierre did not know that these troops were not as bennigsen supposed
put there to defend the position but were in a concealed position as an
ambush that they should not be seen and might be able to strike an
approaching enemy unexpectedly bennigsen did not know this and moved
the troops forward according to his own ideas without mentioning the
matter to the commanderinchief





chapter xxiv

on that bright evening of august  prince andrew lay leaning on his
elbow in a brokendown shed in the village of knyazkovo at the further
end of his regiments encampment through a gap in the broken wall he
could see beside the wooden fence a row of thirty yearold birches
with their lower branches lopped off a field on which shocks of oats
were standing and some bushes near which rose the smoke of
campfiresthe soldiers kitchens

narrow and burdensome and useless to anyone as his life now seemed to
him prince andrew on the eve of battle felt agitated and irritable as
he had done seven years before at austerlitz

he had received and given the orders for next days battle and had
nothing more to do but his thoughtsthe simplest clearest and
therefore most terrible thoughtswould give him no peace he knew that
tomorrows battle would be the most terrible of all he had taken part
in and for the first time in his life the possibility of death
presented itself to himnot in relation to any worldly matter or with
reference to its effect on others but simply in relation to himself to
his own soulvividly plainly terribly and almost as a certainty and
from the height of this perception all that had previously tormented and
preoccupied him suddenly became illumined by a cold white light without
shadows without perspective without distinction of outline all life
appeared to him like magiclantern pictures at which he had long been
gazing by artificial light through a glass now he suddenly saw those
badly daubed pictures in clear daylight and without a glass yes yes
there they are those false images that agitated enraptured and
tormented me said he to himself passing in review the principal
pictures of the magic lantern of life and regarding them now in the cold
white daylight of his clear perception of death there they are those
rudely painted figures that once seemed splendid and mysterious glory
the good of society love of a woman the fatherland itselfhow
important these pictures appeared to me with what profound meaning they
seemed to be filled and it is all so simple pale and crude in the
cold white light of this morning which i feel is dawning for me the
three great sorrows of his life held his attention in particular his
love for a woman his fathers death and the french invasion which had
overrun half russia love that little girl who seemed to me brimming
over with mystic forces yes indeed i loved her i made romantic plans
of love and happiness with her oh what a boy i was he said aloud
bitterly ah me i believed in some ideal love which was to keep her
faithful to me for the whole year of my absence like the gentle dove in
the fable she was to pine apart from me but it was much simpler
really it was all very simple and horrible

when my father built bald hills he thought the place was his his land
his air his peasants but napoleon came and swept him aside
unconscious of his existence as he might brush a chip from his path
and his bald hills and his whole life fell to pieces princess mary says
it is a trial sent from above what is the trial for when he is not
here and will never return he is not here for whom then is the trial
intended the fatherland the destruction of moscow and tomorrow i
shall be killed perhaps not even by a frenchman but by one of our own
men by a soldier discharging a musket close to my ear as one of them
did yesterday and the french will come and take me by head and heels
and fling me into a hole that i may not stink under their noses and new
conditions of life will arise which will seem quite ordinary to others
and about which i shall know nothing i shall not exist

he looked at the row of birches shining in the sunshine with their
motionless green and yellow foliage and white bark to die to be
killed tomorrow that i should not exist that all this should still
be but no me

and the birches with their light and shade the curly clouds the smoke
of the campfires and all that was around him changed and seemed
terrible and menacing a cold shiver ran down his spine he rose
quickly went out of the shed and began to walk about

after he had returned voices were heard outside the shed whos that
he cried

the rednosed captain timokhin formerly dólokhovs squadron commander
but now from lack of officers a battalion commander shyly entered the
shed followed by an adjutant and the regimental paymaster

prince andrew rose hastily listened to the business they had come
about gave them some further instructions and was about to dismiss
them when he heard a familiar lisping voice behind the shed

devil take it said the voice of a man stumbling over something

prince andrew looked out of the shed and saw pierre who had tripped
over a pole on the ground and had nearly fallen coming his way it was
unpleasant to prince andrew to meet people of his own set in general
and pierre especially for he reminded him of all the painful moments of
his last visit to moscow

you what a surprise said he what brings you here this is
unexpected

as he said this his eyes and face expressed more than coldnessthey
expressed hostility which pierre noticed at once he had approached the
shed full of animation but on seeing prince andrews face he felt
constrained and ill at ease

i have come simply you know come it interests me said
pierre who had so often that day senselessly repeated that word
interesting i wish to see the battle

oh yes and what do the masonic brothers say about war how would they
stop it said prince andrew sarcastically well and hows moscow and
my people have they reached moscow at last he asked seriously

yes they have julie drubetskáya told me so i went to see them but
missed them they have gone to your estate near moscow





chapter xxv

the officers were about to take leave but prince andrew apparently
reluctant to be left alone with his friend asked them to stay and have
tea seats were brought in and so was the tea the officers gazed with
surprise at pierres huge stout figure and listened to his talk of
moscow and the position of our army round which he had ridden prince
andrew remained silent and his expression was so forbidding that pierre
addressed his remarks chiefly to the goodnatured battalion commander

so you understand the whole position of our troops prince andrew
interrupted him

yesthat is how do you mean said pierre not being a military man i
cant say i have understood it fully but i understand the general
position

well then you know more than anyone else be it who it may said
prince andrew

oh said pierre looking over his spectacles in perplexity at prince
andrew well and what do you think of kutúzovs appointment he
asked

i was very glad of his appointment thats all i know replied prince
andrew

and tell me your opinion of barclay de tolly in moscow they are saying
heaven knows what about him what do you think of him

ask them replied prince andrew indicating the officers

pierre looked at timokhin with the condescendingly interrogative smile
with which everybody involuntarily addressed that officer

we see light again since his serenity has been appointed your
excellency said timokhin timidly and continually turning to glance at
his colonel

why so asked pierre

well to mention only firewood and fodder let me inform you why when
we were retreating from sventsyani we dare not touch a stick or a wisp
of hay or anything you see we were going away so he would get it all
wasnt it so your excellency and again timokhin turned to the prince
but we darent in our regiment two officers were courtmartialed for
that kind of thing but when his serenity took command everything became
straight forward now we see light

then why was it forbidden

timokhin looked about in confusion not knowing what or how to answer
such a question pierre put the same question to prince andrew

why so as not to lay waste the country we were abandoning to the
enemy said prince andrew with venomous irony it is very sound one
cant permit the land to be pillaged and accustom the troops to
marauding at smolensk too he judged correctly that the french might
outflank us as they had larger forces but he could not understand
this cried prince andrew in a shrill voice that seemed to escape him
involuntarily he could not understand that there for the first time
we were fighting for russian soil and that there was a spirit in the
men such as i had never seen before that we had held the french for two
days and that that success had increased our strength tenfold he
ordered us to retreat and all our efforts and losses went for nothing
he had no thought of betraying us he tried to do the best he could he
thought out everything and that is why he is unsuitable he is
unsuitable now just because he plans out everything very thoroughly and
accurately as every german has to how can i explain well say your
father has a german valet and he is a splendid valet and satisfies your
fathers requirements better than you could then its all right to let
him serve but if your father is mortally sick youll send the valet
away and attend to your father with your own unpracticed awkward hands
and will soothe him better than a skilled man who is a stranger could
so it has been with barclay while russia was well a foreigner could
serve her and be a splendid minister but as soon as she is in danger
she needs one of her own kin but in your club they have been making him
out a traitor they slander him as a traitor and the only result will
be that afterwards ashamed of their false accusations they will make
him out a hero or a genius instead of a traitor and that will be still
more unjust he is an honest and very punctilious german

and they say hes a skillful commander rejoined pierre

i dont understand what is meant by a skillful commander replied
prince andrew ironically

a skillful commander replied pierre why one who foresees all
contingencies and foresees the adversarys intentions

but thats impossible said prince andrew as if it were a matter
settled long ago

pierre looked at him in surprise

and yet they say that war is like a game of chess he remarked

yes replied prince andrew but with this little difference that in
chess you may think over each move as long as you please and are not
limited for time and with this difference too that a knight is always
stronger than a pawn and two pawns are always stronger than one while
in war a battalion is sometimes stronger than a division and sometimes
weaker than a company the relative strength of bodies of troops can
never be known to anyone believe me he went on if things depended
on arrangements made by the staff i should be there making
arrangements but instead of that i have the honor to serve here in the
regiment with these gentlemen and i consider that on us tomorrows
battle will depend and not on those others success never depends
and never will depend on position or equipment or even on numbers
and least of all on position

but on what then

on the feeling that is in me and in him he pointed to timokhin and
in each soldier

prince andrew glanced at timokhin who looked at his commander in alarm
and bewilderment in contrast to his former reticent taciturnity prince
andrew now seemed excited he could apparently not refrain from
expressing the thoughts that had suddenly occurred to him

a battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it why did we lose
the battle at austerlitz the french losses were almost equal to ours
but very early we said to ourselves that we were losing the battle and
we did lose it and we said so because we had nothing to fight for
there we wanted to get away from the battlefield as soon as we could
weve lost so let us run and we ran if we had not said that till
the evening heaven knows what might not have happened but tomorrow we
shant say it you talk about our position the left flank weak and the
right flank too extended he went on thats all nonsense theres
nothing of the kind but what awaits us tomorrow a hundred million most
diverse chances which will be decided on the instant by the fact that
our men or theirs run or do not run and that this man or that man is
killed but all that is being done at present is only play the fact is
that those men with whom you have ridden round the position not only do
not help matters but hinder they are only concerned with their own
petty interests

at such a moment said pierre reproachfully

at such a moment prince andrew repeated to them it is only a moment
affording opportunities to undermine a rival and obtain an extra cross
or ribbon for me tomorrow means this a russian army of a hundred
thousand and a french army of a hundred thousand have met to fight and
the thing is that these two hundred thousand men will fight and the side
that fights more fiercely and spares itself least will win and if you
like i will tell you that whatever happens and whatever muddles those at
the top may make we shall win tomorrows battle tomorrow happen what
may we shall win

there now your excellency thats the truth the real truth said
timokhin who would spare himself now the soldiers in my battalion
believe me wouldnt drink their vodka its not the day for that
they say

all were silent the officers rose prince andrew went out of the shed
with them giving final orders to the adjutant after they had gone
pierre approached prince andrew and was about to start a conversation
when they heard the clatter of three horses hoofs on the road not far
from the shed and looking in that direction prince andrew recognized
wolzogen and clausewitz accompanied by a cossack they rode close by
continuing to converse and prince andrew involuntarily heard these
words

der krieg muss in raum verlegt werden der ansicht kann ich nicht genug
preis geben  said one of them

 the war must be extended widely i cannot sufficiently commend that
view

oh ja said the other der zweck ist nur den feind zu schwächen so
kann man gewiss nicht den verlust der privatpersonen in achtung
nehmen

 oh yes the only aim is to weaken the enemy so of course one cannot
take into account the loss of private individuals

oh no agreed the other

extend widely said prince andrew with an angry snort when they had
ridden past in that extend were my father son and sister at bald
hills thats all the same to him thats what i was saying to youthose
german gentlemen wont win the battle tomorrow but will only make all
the mess they can because they have nothing in their german heads but
theories not worth an empty eggshell and havent in their hearts the one
thing needed tomorrowthat which timokhin has they have yielded up all
europe to him and have now come to teach us fine teachers and again
his voice grew shrill

so you think we shall win tomorrows battle asked pierre

yes yes answered prince andrew absently one thing i would do if i
had the power he began again i would not take prisoners why take
prisoners its chivalry the french have destroyed my home and are on
their way to destroy moscow they have outraged and are outraging me
every moment they are my enemies in my opinion they are all criminals
and so thinks timokhin and the whole army they should be executed
since they are my foes they cannot be my friends whatever may have been
said at tilsit

yes yes muttered pierre looking with shining eyes at prince andrew
i quite agree with you

the question that had perturbed pierre on the mozhaysk hill and all that
day now seemed to him quite clear and completely solved he now
understood the whole meaning and importance of this war and of the
impending battle all he had seen that day all the significant and
stern expressions on the faces he had seen in passing were lit up for
him by a new light he understood that latent heat as they say in
physics of patriotism which was present in all these men he had seen
and this explained to him why they all prepared for death calmly and as
it were lightheartedly

not take prisoners prince andrew continued that by itself would
quite change the whole war and make it less cruel as it is we have
played at warthats whats vile we play at magnanimity and all that
stuff such magnanimity and sensibility are like the magnanimity and
sensibility of a lady who faints when she sees a calf being killed she
is so kindhearted that she cant look at blood but enjoys eating the
calf served up with sauce they talk to us of the rules of war of
chivalry of flags of truce of mercy to the unfortunate and so on its
all rubbish i saw chivalry and flags of truce in  they humbugged
us and we humbugged them they plunder other peoples houses issue
false paper money and worst of all they kill my children and my father
and then talk of rules of war and magnanimity to foes take no
prisoners but kill and be killed he who has come to this as i have
through the same sufferings

prince andrew who had thought it was all the same to him whether or not
moscow was taken as smolensk had been was suddenly checked in his
speech by an unexpected cramp in his throat he paced up and down a few
times in silence but his eyes glittered feverishly and his lips
quivered as he began speaking

if there was none of this magnanimity in war we should go to war only
when it was worth while going to certain death as now then there would
not be war because paul ivánovich had offended michael ivánovich and
when there was a war like this one it would be war and then the
determination of the troops would be quite different then all these
westphalians and hessians whom napoleon is leading would not follow him
into russia and we should not go to fight in austria and prussia
without knowing why war is not courtesy but the most horrible thing in
life and we ought to understand that and not play at war we ought to
accept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously it all lies in
that get rid of falsehood and let war be war and not a game as it is
now war is the favorite pastime of the idle and frivolous the military
calling is the most highly honored

but what is war what is needed for success in warfare what are the
habits of the military the aim of war is murder the methods of war are
spying treachery and their encouragement the ruin of a countrys
inhabitants robbing them or stealing to provision the army and fraud
and falsehood termed military craft the habits of the military class
are the absence of freedom that is discipline idleness ignorance
cruelty debauchery and drunkenness and in spite of all this it is the
highest class respected by everyone all the kings except the chinese
wear military uniforms and he who kills most people receives the
highest rewards

they meet as we shall meet tomorrow to murder one another they kill
and maim tens of thousands and then have thanksgiving services for
having killed so many people they even exaggerate the number and they
announce a victory supposing that the more people they have killed the
greater their achievement how does god above look at them and hear
them exclaimed prince andrew in a shrill piercing voice ah my
friend it has of late become hard for me to live i see that i have
begun to understand too much and it doesnt do for man to taste of the
tree of knowledge of good and evil ah well its not for long he
added

however youre sleepy and its time for me to sleep go back to
gorki said prince andrew suddenly

oh no pierre replied looking at prince andrew with frightened
compassionate eyes

go go before a battle one must have ones sleep out repeated prince
andrew

he came quickly up to pierre and embraced and kissed him goodbye be
off he shouted whether we meet again or not and turning away
hurriedly he entered the shed

it was already dark and pierre could not make out whether the
expression of prince andrews face was angry or tender

for some time he stood in silence considering whether he should follow
him or go away no he does not want it pierre concluded and i know
that this is our last meeting he sighed deeply and rode back to gorki

on reentering the shed prince andrew lay down on a rug but he could
not sleep

he closed his eyes one picture succeeded another in his imagination on
one of them he dwelt long and joyfully he vividly recalled an evening
in petersburg natásha with animated and excited face was telling him
how she had gone to look for mushrooms the previous summer and had lost
her way in the big forest she incoherently described the depths of the
forest her feelings and a talk with a beekeeper she met and
constantly interrupted her story to say no i cant im not telling
it right no you dont understand though he encouraged her by saying
that he did understand and he really had understood all she wanted to
say but natásha was not satisfied with her own words she felt that
they did not convey the passionately poetic feeling she had experienced
that day and wished to convey he was such a delightful old man and it
was so dark in the forest and he had such kind no i cant
describe it she had said flushed and excited prince andrew smiled
now the same happy smile as then when he had looked into her eyes i
understood her he thought i not only understood her but it was just
that inner spiritual force that sincerity that frankness of soulthat
very soul of hers which seemed to be fettered by her bodyit was that
soul i loved in her loved so strongly and happily and suddenly he
remembered how his love had ended he did not need anything of that
kind he neither saw nor understood anything of the sort he only saw in
her a pretty and fresh young girl with whom he did not deign to unite
his fate and i and he is still alive and gay

prince andrew jumped up as if someone had burned him and again began
pacing up and down in front of the shed





chapter xxvi

on august  the eve of the battle of borodino m de beausset prefect
of the french emperors palace arrived at napoleons quarters at
valuevo with colonel fabvier the former from paris and the latter from
madrid

donning his court uniform m de beausset ordered a box he had brought
for the emperor to be carried before him and entered the first
compartment of napoleons tent where he began opening the box while
conversing with napoleons aidesdecamp who surrounded him

fabvier not entering the tent remained at the entrance talking to some
generals of his acquaintance

the emperor napoleon had not yet left his bedroom and was finishing his
toilet slightly snorting and grunting he presented now his back and
now his plump hairy chest to the brush with which his valet was rubbing
him down another valet with his finger over the mouth of a bottle was
sprinkling eau de cologne on the emperors pampered body with an
expression which seemed to say that he alone knew where and how much eau
de cologne should be sprinkled napoleons short hair was wet and matted
on the forehead but his face though puffy and yellow expressed
physical satisfaction go on harder go on he muttered to the valet
who was rubbing him slightly twitching and grunting an aidedecamp
who had entered the bedroom to report to the emperor the number of
prisoners taken in yesterdays action was standing by the door after
delivering his message awaiting permission to withdraw napoleon
frowning looked at him from under his brows

no prisoners said he repeating the aidedecamps words they are
forcing us to exterminate them so much the worse for the russian
army go on harder harder he muttered hunching his back and
presenting his fat shoulders

all right let monsieur de beausset enter and fabvier too he said
nodding to the aidedecamp

yes sire and the aidedecamp disappeared through the door of the
tent

two valets rapidly dressed his majesty and wearing the blue uniform of
the guards he went with firm quick steps to the reception room

de beaussets hands meanwhile were busily engaged arranging the present
he had brought from the empress on two chairs directly in front of the
entrance but napoleon had dressed and come out with such unexpected
rapidity that he had not time to finish arranging the surprise

napoleon noticed at once what they were about and guessed that they were
not ready he did not wish to deprive them of the pleasure of giving him
a surprise so he pretended not to see de beausset and called fabvier to
him listening silently and with a stern frown to what fabvier told him
of the heroism and devotion of his troops fighting at salamanca at the
other end of europe with but one thoughtto be worthy of their
emperorand but one fearto fail to please him the result of that
battle had been deplorable napoleon made ironic remarks during
fabviers account as if he had not expected that matters could go
otherwise in his absence

i must make up for that in moscow said napoleon ill see you
later he added and summoned de beausset who by that time had
prepared the surprise having placed something on the chairs and covered
it with a cloth

de beausset bowed low with that courtly french bow which only the old
retainers of the bourbons knew how to make and approached him
presenting an envelope

napoleon turned to him gaily and pulled his ear

you have hurried here i am very glad well what is paris saying he
asked suddenly changing his former stern expression for a most cordial
tone

sire all paris regrets your absence replied de beausset as was
proper

but though napoleon knew that de beausset had to say something of this
kind and though in his lucid moments he knew it was untrue he was
pleased to hear it from him again he honored him by touching his ear

i am very sorry to have made you travel so far said he

sire i expected nothing less than to find you at the gates of moscow
replied de beausset

napoleon smiled and lifting his head absentmindedly glanced to the
right an aidedecamp approached with gliding steps and offered him a
gold snuffbox which he took

yes it has happened luckily for you he said raising the open
snuffbox to his nose you are fond of travel and in three days you
will see moscow you surely did not expect to see that asiatic capital
you will have a pleasant journey

de beausset bowed gratefully at this regard for his taste for travel of
which he had not till then been aware

ha whats this asked napoleon noticing that all the courtiers were
looking at something concealed under a cloth

with courtly adroitness de beausset half turned and without turning his
back to the emperor retired two steps twitching off the cloth at the
same time and said

a present to your majesty from the empress

it was a portrait painted in bright colors by gerard of the son borne
to napoleon by the daughter of the emperor of austria the boy whom for
some reason everyone called the king of rome

a very pretty curlyheaded boy with a look of the christ in the sistine
madonna was depicted playing at stick and ball the ball represented the
terrestrial globe and the stick in his other hand a scepter

though it was not clear what the artist meant to express by depicting
the socalled king of rome spiking the earth with a stick the allegory
apparently seemed to napoleon as it had done to all who had seen it in
paris quite clear and very pleasing

the king of rome he said pointing to the portrait with a graceful
gesture admirable

with the natural capacity of an italian for changing the expression of
his face at will he drew nearer to the portrait and assumed a look of
pensive tenderness he felt that what he now said and did would be
historical and it seemed to him that it would now be best for himwhose
grandeur enabled his son to play stick and ball with the terrestrial
globeto show in contrast to that grandeur the simplest paternal
tenderness his eyes grew dim he moved forward glanced round at a
chair which seemed to place itself under him and sat down on it
before the portrait at a single gesture from him everyone went out on
tiptoe leaving the great man to himself and his emotion

having sat still for a while he touchedhimself not knowing whythe
thick spot of paint representing the highest light in the portrait
rose and recalled de beausset and the officer on duty he ordered the
portrait to be carried outside his tent that the old guard stationed
round it might not be deprived of the pleasure of seeing the king of
rome the son and heir of their adored monarch

and while he was doing m de beausset the honor of breakfasting with
him they heard as napoleon had anticipated the rapturous cries of the
officers and men of the old guard who had run up to see the portrait

vive lempereur vive le roi de rome vive lempereur came those
ecstatic cries

after breakfast napoleon in de beaussets presence dictated his order of
the day to the army

short and energetic he remarked when he had read over the
proclamation which he had dictated straight off without corrections it
ran

soldiers this is the battle you have so longed for victory depends on
you it is essential for us it will give us all we need comfortable
quarters and a speedy return to our country behave as you did at
austerlitz friedland vitebsk and smolensk let our remotest posterity
recall your achievements this day with pride let it be said of each of
you he was in the great battle before moscow

before moscow repeated napoleon and inviting m de beausset who was
so fond of travel to accompany him on his ride he went out of the tent
to where the horses stood saddled

your majesty is too kind replied de beausset to the invitation to
accompany the emperor he wanted to sleep did not know how to ride and
was afraid of doing so

but napoleon nodded to the traveler and de beausset had to mount when
napoleon came out of the tent the shouting of the guards before his
sons portrait grew still louder napoleon frowned

take him away he said pointing with a gracefully majestic gesture to
the portrait it is too soon for him to see a field of battle

de beausset closed his eyes bowed his head and sighed deeply to
indicate how profoundly he valued and comprehended the emperors words





chapter xxvii

on the twentyfifth of august so his historians tell us napoleon spent
the whole day on horseback inspecting the locality considering plans
submitted to him by his marshals and personally giving commands to his
generals

the original line of the russian forces along the river kolocha had been
dislocated by the capture of the shevardino redoubt on the twenty
fourth and part of the linethe left flankhad been drawn back that
part of the line was not entrenched and in front of it the ground was
more open and level than elsewhere it was evident to anyone military
or not that it was here the french should attack it would seem that
not much consideration was needed to reach this conclusion nor any
particular care or trouble on the part of the emperor and his marshals
nor was there any need of that special and supreme quality called genius
that people are so apt to ascribe to napoleon yet the historians who
described the event later and the men who then surrounded napoleon and
he himself thought otherwise

napoleon rode over the plain and surveyed the locality with a profound
air and in silence nodded with approval or shook his head dubiously
and without communicating to the generals around him the profound course
of ideas which guided his decisions merely gave them his final
conclusions in the form of commands having listened to a suggestion
from davout who was now called prince deckmuhl to turn the russian
left wing napoleon said it should not be done without explaining why
not to a proposal made by general campan who was to attack the
fleches to lead his division through the woods napoleon agreed though
the socalled duke of elchingen ney ventured to remark that a movement
through the woods was dangerous and might disorder the division

having inspected the country opposite the shevardino redoubt napoleon
pondered a little in silence and then indicated the spots where two
batteries should be set up by the morrow to act against the russian
entrenchments and the places where in line with them the field
artillery should be placed

after giving these and other commands he returned to his tent and the
dispositions for the battle were written down from his dictation

these dispositions of which the french historians write with enthusiasm
and other historians with profound respect were as follows

at dawn the two new batteries established during the night on the plain
occupied by the prince deckmuhl will open fire on the opposing
batteries of the enemy

at the same time the commander of the artillery of the st corps
general pernetti with thirty cannon of campans division and all the
howitzers of dessaixs and friants divisions will move forward open
fire and overwhelm with shellfire the enemys battery against which
will operate

 guns of the artillery of the guards  guns of campans division

and      guns of friants and dessaixs divisions

in all  guns

the commander of the artillery of the rd corps general fouche will
place the howitzers of the rd and th corps sixteen in all on the
flanks of the battery that is to bombard the entrenchment on the left
which will have forty guns in all directed against it

general sorbier must be ready at the first order to advance with all the
howitzers of the guards artillery against either one or other of the
entrenchments

during the cannonade prince poniatowski is to advance through the wood
on the village and turn the enemys position

general campan will move through the wood to seize the first
fortification

after the advance has begun in this manner orders will be given in
accordance with the enemys movements

the cannonade on the left flank will begin as soon as the guns of the
right wing are heard the sharpshooters of morands division and of the
vicekings division will open a heavy fire on seeing the attack
commence on the right wing

the viceking will occupy the village and cross by its three bridges
advancing to the same heights as morands and gibrards divisions which
under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt and come into
line with the rest of the forces

all this must be done in good order le tout se fera avec ordre et
methode as far as possible retaining troops in reserve

the imperial camp near mozhaysk

september

these dispositions which are very obscure and confused if one allows
oneself to regard the arrangements without religious awe of his genius
related to napoleons orders to deal with four pointsfour different
orders not one of these was or could be carried out

in the disposition it is said first that the batteries placed on the
spot chosen by napoleon with the guns of pernetti and fouche which
were to come in line with them  guns in all were to open fire and
shower shells on the russian fleches and redoubts this could not be
done as from the spots selected by napoleon the projectiles did not
carry to the russian works and those  guns shot into the air until
the nearest commander contrary to napoleons instructions moved them
forward

the second order was that poniatowski moving to the village through the
wood should turn the russian left flank this could not be done and was
not done because poniatowski advancing on the village through the
wood met tuchkov there barring his way and could not and did not turn
the russian position

the third order was general campan will move through the wood to seize
the first fortification general campans division did not seize the
first fortification but was driven back for on emerging from the wood
it had to reform under grapeshot of which napoleon was unaware

the fourth order was the viceking will occupy the village borodino
and cross by its three bridges advancing to the same heights as
morands and gibrards divisions for whose movements no directions are
given which under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt
and come into line with the rest of the forces

as far as one can make out not so much from this unintelligible
sentence as from the attempts the viceking made to execute the orders
given him he was to advance from the left through borodino to the
redoubt while the divisions of morand and gerard were to advance
simultaneously from the front

all this like the other parts of the disposition was not and could not
be executed after passing through borodino the viceking was driven
back to the kolocha and could get no farther while the divisions of
morand and gerard did not take the redoubt but were driven back and the
redoubt was only taken at the end of the battle by the cavalry a thing
probably unforeseen and not heard of by napoleon so not one of the
orders in the disposition was or could be executed but in the
disposition it is said that after the fight has commenced in this
manner orders will be given in accordance with the enemys movements
and so it might be supposed that all necessary arrangements would be
made by napoleon during the battle but this was not and could not be
done for during the whole battle napoleon was so far away that as
appeared later he could not know the course of the battle and not one
of his orders during the fight could be executed





chapter xxviii

many historians say that the french did not win the battle of borodino
because napoleon had a cold and that if he had not had a cold the
orders he gave before and during the battle would have been still more
full of genius and russia would have been lost and the face of the world
have been changed to historians who believe that russia was shaped by
the will of one manpeter the greatand that france from a republic
became an empire and french armies went to russia at the will of one
mannapoleonto say that russia remained a power because napoleon had a
bad cold on the twentyfourth of august may seem logical and convincing

if it had depended on napoleons will to fight or not to fight the
battle of borodino and if this or that other arrangement depended on
his will then evidently a cold affecting the manifestation of his will
might have saved russia and consequently the valet who omitted to bring
napoleon his waterproof boots on the twentyfourth would have been the
savior of russia along that line of thought such a deduction is
indubitable as indubitable as the deduction voltaire made in jest
without knowing what he was jesting at when he saw that the massacre
of st bartholomew was due to charles ixs stomach being deranged but
to men who do not admit that russia was formed by the will of one man
peter i or that the french empire was formed and the war with russia
begun by the will of one man napoleon that argument seems not merely
untrue and irrational but contrary to all human reality to the
question of what causes historic events another answer presents itself
namely that the course of human events is predetermined from on
highdepends on the coincidence of the wills of all who take part in the
events and that a napoleons influence on the course of these events is
purely external and fictitious

strange as at first glance it may seem to suppose that the massacre of
st bartholomew was not due to charles ixs will though he gave the
order for it and thought it was done as a result of that order and
strange as it may seem to suppose that the slaughter of eighty thousand
men at borodino was not due to napoleons will though he ordered the
commencement and conduct of the battle and thought it was done because
he ordered it strange as these suppositions appear yet human
dignitywhich tells me that each of us is if not more at least not less
a man than the great napoleondemands the acceptance of that solution of
the question and historic investigation abundantly confirms it

at the battle of borodino napoleon shot at no one and killed no one
that was all done by the soldiers therefore it was not he who killed
people

the french soldiers went to kill and be killed at the battle of borodino
not because of napoleons orders but by their own volition the whole
armyfrench italian german polish and dutchhungry ragged and
weary of the campaign felt at the sight of an army blocking their road
to moscow that the wine was drawn and must be drunk had napoleon then
forbidden them to fight the russians they would have killed him and
have proceeded to fight the russians because it was inevitable

when they heard napoleons proclamation offering them as compensation
for mutilation and death the words of posterity about their having been
in the battle before moscow they cried vive lempereur just as they
had cried vive lempereur at the sight of the portrait of the boy
piercing the terrestrial globe with a toy stick and just as they would
have cried vive lempereur at any nonsense that might be told them
there was nothing left for them to do but cry vive lempereur and go
to fight in order to get food and rest as conquerors in moscow so it
was not because of napoleons commands that they killed their fellow
men

and it was not napoleon who directed the course of the battle for none
of his orders were executed and during the battle he did not know what
was going on before him so the way in which these people killed one
another was not decided by napoleons will but occurred independently of
him in accord with the will of hundreds of thousands of people who took
part in the common action it only seemed to napoleon that it all took
place by his will and so the question whether he had or had not a cold
has no more historic interest than the cold of the least of the
transport soldiers

moreover the assertion made by various writers that his cold was the
cause of his dispositions not being as wellplanned as on former
occasions and of his orders during the battle not being as good as
previously is quite baseless which again shows that napoleons cold on
the twentysixth of august was unimportant

the dispositions cited above are not at all worse but are even better
than previous dispositions by which he had won victories his pseudo
orders during the battle were also no worse than formerly but much the
same as usual these dispositions and orders only seem worse than
previous ones because the battle of borodino was the first napoleon did
not win the profoundest and most excellent dispositions and orders seem
very bad and every learned militarist criticizes them with looks of
importance when they relate to a battle that has been lost and the
very worst dispositions and orders seem very good and serious people
fill whole volumes to demonstrate their merits when they relate to a
battle that has been won

the dispositions drawn up by weyrother for the battle of austerlitz were
a model of perfection for that kind of composition but still they were
criticizedcriticized for their very perfection for their excessive
minuteness

napoleon at the battle of borodino fulfilled his office as
representative of authority as well as and even better than at other
battles he did nothing harmful to the progress of the battle he
inclined to the most reasonable opinions he made no confusion did not
contradict himself did not get frightened or run away from the field of
battle but with his great tact and military experience carried out his
role of appearing to command calmly and with dignity





chapter xxix

on returning from a second inspection of the lines napoleon remarked

the chessmen are set up the game will begin tomorrow

having ordered punch and summoned de beausset he began to talk to him
about paris and about some changes he meant to make in the empress
household surprising the prefect by his memory of minute details
relating to the court

he showed an interest in trifles joked about de beaussets love of
travel and chatted carelessly as a famous selfconfident surgeon who
knows his job does when turning up his sleeves and putting on his apron
while a patient is being strapped to the operating table the matter is
in my hands and is clear and definite in my head when the time comes to
set to work i shall do it as no one else could but now i can jest and
the more i jest and the calmer i am the more tranquil and confident you
ought to be and the more amazed at my genius

having finished his second glass of punch napoleon went to rest before
the serious business which he considered awaited him next day he was
so much interested in that task that he was unable to sleep and in
spite of his cold which had grown worse from the dampness of the
evening he went into the large division of the tent at three oclock in
the morning loudly blowing his nose he asked whether the russians had
not withdrawn and was told that the enemys fires were still in the
same places he nodded approval

the adjutant in attendance came into the tent

well rapp do you think we shall do good business today napoleon
asked him

without doubt sire replied rapp

napoleon looked at him

do you remember sire what you did me the honor to say at smolensk
continued rapp the wine is drawn and must be drunk

napoleon frowned and sat silent for a long time leaning his head on his
hand

this poor army he suddenly remarked it has diminished greatly since
smolensk fortune is frankly a courtesan rapp i have always said so
and i am beginning to experience it but the guards rapp the guards
are intact he remarked interrogatively

yes sire replied rapp

napoleon took a lozenge put it in his mouth and glanced at his watch
he was not sleepy and it was still not nearly morning it was impossible
to give further orders for the sake of killing time for the orders had
all been given and were now being executed

have the biscuits and rice been served out to the regiments of the
guards asked napoleon sternly

yes sire

the rice too

rapp replied that he had given the emperors order about the rice but
napoleon shook his head in dissatisfaction as if not believing that his
order had been executed an attendant came in with punch napoleon
ordered another glass to be brought for rapp and silently sipped his
own

i have neither taste nor smell he remarked sniffing at his glass
this cold is tiresome they talk about medicinewhat is the good of
medicine when it cant cure a cold corvisart gave me these lozenges but
they dont help at all what can doctors cure one cant cure anything
our body is a machine for living it is organized for that it is its
nature let life go on in it unhindered and let it defend itself it
will do more than if you paralyze it by encumbering it with remedies
our body is like a perfect watch that should go for a certain time the
watchmaker cannot open it he can only adjust it by fumbling and that
blindfold yes our body is just a machine for living that is all

and having entered on the path of definition of which he was fond
napoleon suddenly and unexpectedly gave a new one

do you know rapp what military art is asked he it is the art of
being stronger than the enemy at a given moment thats all

rapp made no reply

tomorrow we shall have to deal with kutúzov said napoleon we shall
see do you remember at braunau he commanded an army for three weeks and
did not once mount a horse to inspect his entrenchments we shall
see

he looked at his watch it was still only four oclock he did not feel
sleepy the punch was finished and there was still nothing to do he
rose walked to and fro put on a warm overcoat and a hat and went out
of the tent the night was dark and damp a scarcely perceptible
moisture was descending from above near by the campfires were dimly
burning among the french guards and in the distance those of the
russian line shone through the smoke the weather was calm and the
rustle and tramp of the french troops already beginning to move to take
up their positions were clearly audible

napoleon walked about in front of his tent looked at the fires and
listened to these sounds and as he was passing a tall guardsman in a
shaggy cap who was standing sentinel before his tent and had drawn
himself up like a black pillar at sight of the emperor napoleon stopped
in front of him

what year did you enter the service he asked with that affectation of
military bluntness and geniality with which he always addressed the
soldiers

the man answered the question

ah one of the old ones has your regiment had its rice

it has your majesty

napoleon nodded and walked away

at halfpast five napoleon rode to the village of shevardino

it was growing light the sky was clearing only a single cloud lay in
the east the abandoned campfires were burning themselves out in the
faint morning light

on the right a single deep report of a cannon resounded and died away in
the prevailing silence some minutes passed a second and a third report
shook the air then a fourth and a fifth boomed solemnly near by on the
right

the first shots had not yet ceased to reverberate before others rang out
and yet more were heard mingling with and overtaking one another

napoleon with his suite rode up to the shevardino redoubt where he
dismounted the game had begun





chapter xxx

on returning to gorki after having seen prince andrew pierre ordered
his groom to get the horses ready and to call him early in the morning
and then immediately fell asleep behind a partition in a corner borís
had given up to him

before he was thoroughly awake next morning everybody had already left
the hut the panes were rattling in the little windows and his groom was
shaking him

your excellency your excellency your excellency he kept repeating
pertinaciously while he shook pierre by the shoulder without looking at
him having apparently lost hope of getting him to wake up

what has it begun is it time pierre asked waking up

hear the firing said the groom a discharged soldier all the
gentlemen have gone out and his serene highness himself rode past long
ago

pierre dressed hastily and ran out to the porch outside all was bright
fresh dewy and cheerful the sun just bursting forth from behind a
cloud that had concealed it was shining with rays still half broken by
the clouds over the roofs of the street opposite on the dew
besprinkled dust of the road on the walls of the houses on the
windows the fence and on pierres horses standing before the hut the
roar of guns sounded more distinct outside an adjutant accompanied by a
cossack passed by at a sharp trot

its time count its time cried the adjutant

telling the groom to follow him with the horses pierre went down the
street to the knoll from which he had looked at the field of battle the
day before a crowd of military men was assembled there members of the
staff could be heard conversing in french and kutúzovs gray head in a
white cap with a red band was visible his gray nape sunk between his
shoulders he was looking through a field glass down the highroad before
him

mounting the steps to the knoll pierre looked at the scene before him
spellbound by beauty it was the same panorama he had admired from that
spot the day before but now the whole place was full of troops and
covered by smoke clouds from the guns and the slanting rays of the
bright sun rising slightly to the left behind pierre cast upon it
through the clear morning air penetrating streaks of rosy goldentinted
light and long dark shadows the forest at the farthest extremity of the
panorama seemed carved in some precious stone of a yellowishgreen
color its undulating outline was silhouetted against the horizon and
was pierced beyond valuevo by the smolensk highroad crowded with troops
nearer at hand glittered golden cornfields interspersed with copses
there were troops to be seen everywhere in front and to the right and
left all this was vivid majestic and unexpected but what impressed
pierre most of all was the view of the battlefield itself of borodino
and the hollows on both sides of the kolocha

above the kolocha in borodino and on both sides of it especially to
the left where the voyna flowing between its marshy banks falls into the
kolocha a mist had spread which seemed to melt to dissolve and to
become translucent when the brilliant sun appeared and magically colored
and outlined everything the smoke of the guns mingled with this mist
and over the whole expanse and through that mist the rays of the morning
sun were reflected flashing back like lightning from the water from
the dew and from the bayonets of the troops crowded together by the
riverbanks and in borodino a white church could be seen through the
mist and here and there the roofs of huts in borodino as well as dense
masses of soldiers or green ammunition chests and ordnance and all
this moved or seemed to move as the smoke and mist spread out over the
whole space just as in the mistenveloped hollow near borodino so
along the entire line outside and above it and especially in the woods
and fields to the left in the valleys and on the summits of the high
ground clouds of powder smoke seemed continually to spring up out of
nothing now singly now several at a time some translucent others
dense which swelling growing rolling and blending extended over
the whole expanse

these puffs of smoke and strange to say the sound of the firing
produced the chief beauty of the spectacle

puffsuddenly a round compact cloud of smoke was seen merging from
violet into gray and milky white and boom came the report a second
later

puff puffand two clouds arose pushing one another and blending
together and boom boom came the sounds confirming what the eye had
seen

pierre glanced round at the first cloud which he had seen as a round
compact ball and in its place already were balloons of smoke floating
to one side andpuff with a pausepuff puff three and then four
more appeared and then from each with the same intervalboomboom
boom came the fine firm precise sounds in reply it seemed as if
those smoke clouds sometimes ran and sometimes stood still while woods
fields and glittering bayonets ran past them from the left over
fields and bushes those large balls of smoke were continually appearing
followed by their solemn reports while nearer still in the hollows and
woods there burst from the muskets small cloudlets that had no time to
become balls but had their little echoes in just the same way trakh
tatatakh came the frequent crackle of musketry but it was irregular
and feeble in comparison with the reports of the cannon

pierre wished to be there with that smoke those shining bayonets that
movement and those sounds he turned to look at kutúzov and his suite
to compare his impressions with those of others they were all looking
at the field of battle as he was and as it seemed to him with the
same feelings all their faces were now shining with that latent warmth
of feeling pierre had noticed the day before and had fully understood
after his talk with prince andrew

go my dear fellow go and christ be with you kutúzov was saying
to a general who stood beside him not taking his eye from the
battlefield

having received this order the general passed by pierre on his way down
the knoll

to the crossing said the general coldly and sternly in reply to one
of the staff who asked where he was going

ill go there too i too thought pierre and followed the general

the general mounted a horse a cossack had brought him pierre went to
his groom who was holding his horses and asking which was the quietest
clambered onto it seized it by the mane and turning out his toes
pressed his heels against its sides and feeling that his spectacles
were slipping off but unable to let go of the mane and reins he
galloped after the general causing the staff officers to smile as they
watched him from the knoll





chapter xxxi

having descended the hill the general after whom pierre was galloping
turned sharply to the left and pierre losing sight of him galloped in
among some ranks of infantry marching ahead of him he tried to pass
either in front of them or to the right or left but there were soldiers
everywhere all with the same preoccupied expression and busy with some
unseen but evidently important task they all gazed with the same
dissatisfied and inquiring expression at this stout man in a white hat
who for some unknown reason threatened to trample them under his horses
hoofs

why ride into the middle of the battalion one of them shouted at him

another prodded his horse with the butt end of a musket and pierre
bending over his saddlebow and hardly able to control his shying horse
galloped ahead of the soldiers where there was a free space

there was a bridge ahead of him where other soldiers stood firing
pierre rode up to them without being aware of it he had come to the
bridge across the kolocha between gorki and borodino which the french
having occupied borodino were attacking in the first phase of the
battle pierre saw that there was a bridge in front of him and that
soldiers were doing something on both sides of it and in the meadow
among the rows of newmown hay which he had taken no notice of amid the
smoke of the campfires the day before but despite the incessant firing
going on there he had no idea that this was the field of battle he did
not notice the sound of the bullets whistling from every side or the
projectiles that flew over him did not see the enemy on the other side
of the river and for a long time did not notice the killed and wounded
though many fell near him he looked about him with a smile which did
not leave his face

whys that fellow in front of the line shouted somebody at him again

to the left keep to the right the men shouted to him

pierre went to the right and unexpectedly encountered one of raevskis
adjutants whom he knew the adjutant looked angrily at him evidently
also intending to shout at him but on recognizing him he nodded

how have you got here he said and galloped on

pierre feeling out of place there having nothing to do and afraid of
getting in someones way again galloped after the adjutant

whats happening here may i come with you he asked

one moment one moment replied the adjutant and riding up to a stout
colonel who was standing in the meadow he gave him some message and
then addressed pierre

why have you come here count he asked with a smile still
inquisitive

yes yes assented pierre

but the adjutant turned his horse about and rode on

here its tolerable said he but with bagration on the left flank
theyre getting it frightfully hot

really said pierre where is that

come along with me to our knoll we can get a view from there and in
our battery it is still bearable said the adjutant will you come

yes ill come with you replied pierre looking round for his groom

it was only now that he noticed wounded men staggering along or being
carried on stretchers on that very meadow he had ridden over the day
before a soldier was lying athwart the rows of scented hay with his
head thrown awkwardly back and his shako off

why havent they carried him away pierre was about to ask but seeing
the stern expression of the adjutant who was also looking that way he
checked himself

pierre did not find his groom and rode along the hollow with the
adjutant to raevskis redoubt his horse lagged behind the adjutants
and jolted him at every step

you dont seem to be used to riding count remarked the adjutant

no its not that but her action seems so jerky said pierre in a
puzzled tone

why shes wounded said the adjutant in the off foreleg above the
knee a bullet no doubt i congratulate you count on your baptism of
fire

having ridden in the smoke past the sixth corps behind the artillery
which had been moved forward and was in action deafening them with the
noise of firing they came to a small wood there it was cool and quiet
with a scent of autumn pierre and the adjutant dismounted and walked up
the hill on foot

is the general here asked the adjutant on reaching the knoll

he was here a minute ago but has just gone that way someone told him
pointing to the right

the adjutant looked at pierre as if puzzled what to do with him now

dont trouble about me said pierre ill go up onto the knoll if i
may

yes do youll see everything from there and its less dangerous and
ill come for you

pierre went to the battery and the adjutant rode on they did not meet
again and only much later did pierre learn that he lost an arm that
day

the knoll to which pierre ascended was that famous one afterwards known
to the russians as the knoll battery or raevskis redoubt and to the
french as la grande redoute la fatale redoute la redoute du centre
around which tens of thousands fell and which the french regarded as
the key to the whole position

this redoubt consisted of a knoll on three sides of which trenches had
been dug within the entrenchment stood ten guns that were being fired
through openings in the earthwork

in line with the knoll on both sides stood other guns which also fired
incessantly a little behind the guns stood infantry when ascending
that knoll pierre had no notion that this spot on which small trenches
had been dug and from which a few guns were firing was the most
important point of the battle

on the contrary just because he happened to be there he thought it one
of the least significant parts of the field

having reached the knoll pierre sat down at one end of a trench
surrounding the battery and gazed at what was going on around him with
an unconsciously happy smile occasionally he rose and walked about the
battery still with that same smile trying not to obstruct the soldiers
who were loading hauling the guns and continually running past him
with bags and charges the guns of that battery were being fired
continually one after another with a deafening roar enveloping the
whole neighborhood in powder smoke

in contrast with the dread felt by the infantrymen placed in support
here in the battery where a small number of men busy at their work were
separated from the rest by a trench everyone experienced a common and
as it were family feeling of animation

the intrusion of pierres nonmilitary figure in a white hat made an
unpleasant impression at first the soldiers looked askance at him with
surprise and even alarm as they went past him the senior artillery
officer a tall longlegged pockmarked man moved over to pierre as if
to see the action of the farthest gun and looked at him with curiosity

a young roundfaced officer quite a boy still and evidently only just
out of the cadet college who was zealously commanding the two guns
entrusted to him addressed pierre sternly

sir he said permit me to ask you to stand aside you must not be
here

the soldiers shook their heads disapprovingly as they looked at pierre
but when they had convinced themselves that this man in the white hat
was doing no harm but either sat quietly on the slope of the trench
with a shy smile or politely making way for the soldiers paced up and
down the battery under fire as calmly as if he were on a boulevard
their feeling of hostile distrust gradually began to change into a
kindly and bantering sympathy such as soldiers feel for their dogs
cocks goats and in general for the animals that live with the
regiment the men soon accepted pierre into their family adopted him
gave him a nickname our gentleman and made kindly fun of him among
themselves

a shell tore up the earth two paces from pierre and he looked around
with a smile as he brushed from his clothes some earth it had thrown up

and hows it youre not afraid sir really now a redfaced broad
shouldered soldier asked pierre with a grin that disclosed a set of
sound white teeth

are you afraid then said pierre

what else do you expect answered the soldier she has no mercy you
know when she comes spluttering down out go your innards one cant
help being afraid he said laughing

several of the men with bright kindly faces stopped beside pierre
they seemed not to have expected him to talk like anybody else and the
discovery that he did so delighted them

its the business of us soldiers but in a gentleman its wonderful
theres a gentleman for you

to your places cried the young officer to the men gathered round
pierre

the young officer was evidently exercising his duties for the first or
second time and therefore treated both his superiors and the men with
great precision and formality

the booming cannonade and the fusillade of musketry were growing more
intense over the whole field especially to the left where bagrations
fleches were but where pierre was the smoke of the firing made it
almost impossible to distinguish anything moreover his whole attention
was engrossed by watching the family circleseparated from all
elseformed by the men in the battery his first unconscious feeling of
joyful animation produced by the sights and sounds of the battlefield
was now replaced by another especially since he had seen that soldier
lying alone in the hayfield now seated on the slope of the trench he
observed the faces of those around him

by ten oclock some twenty men had already been carried away from the
battery two guns were smashed and cannon balls fell more and more
frequently on the battery and spent bullets buzzed and whistled around
but the men in the battery seemed not to notice this and merry voices
and jokes were heard on all sides

a live one shouted a man as a whistling shell approached

not this way to the infantry added another with loud laughter
seeing the shell fly past and fall into the ranks of the supports

are you bowing to a friend eh remarked another chaffing a peasant
who ducked low as a cannon ball flew over

several soldiers gathered by the wall of the trench looking out to see
what was happening in front

theyve withdrawn the front line it has retired said they pointing
over the earthwork

mind your own business an old sergeant shouted at them if theyve
retired its because theres work for them to do farther back

and the sergeant taking one of the men by the shoulders gave him a
shove with his knee this was followed by a burst of laughter

to the fifth gun wheel it up came shouts from one side

now then all together like bargees rose the merry voices of those
who were moving the gun

oh she nearly knocked our gentlemans hat off cried the redfaced
humorist showing his teeth chaffing pierre awkward baggage he added
reproachfully to a cannon ball that struck a cannon wheel and a mans
leg

now then you foxes said another laughing at some militiamen who
stooping low entered the battery to carry away the wounded man

so this gruel isnt to your taste oh you crows youre scared they
shouted at the militiamen who stood hesitating before the man whose leg
had been torn off

there lads oh oh they mimicked the peasants they dont like it
at all

pierre noticed that after every ball that hit the redoubt and after
every loss the liveliness increased more and more

as the flames of the fire hidden within come more and more vividly and
rapidly from an approaching thundercloud so as if in opposition to
what was taking place the lightning of hidden fire growing more and
more intense glowed in the faces of these men

pierre did not look out at the battlefield and was not concerned to know
what was happening there he was entirely absorbed in watching this fire
which burned ever more brightly and which he felt was flaming up in the
same way in his own soul

at ten oclock the infantry that had been among the bushes in front of
the battery and along the kamenka streamlet retreated from the battery
they could be seen running back past it carrying their wounded on their
muskets a general with his suite came to the battery and after
speaking to the colonel gave pierre an angry look and went away again
having ordered the infantry supports behind the battery to lie down so
as to be less exposed to fire after this from amid the ranks of
infantry to the right of the battery came the sound of a drum and shouts
of command and from the battery one saw how those ranks of infantry
moved forward

pierre looked over the wall of the trench and was particularly struck by
a pale young officer who letting his sword hang down was walking
backwards and kept glancing uneasily around

the ranks of the infantry disappeared amid the smoke but their long
drawn shout and rapid musketry firing could still be heard a few
minutes later crowds of wounded men and stretcherbearers came back from
that direction projectiles began to fall still more frequently in the
battery several men were lying about who had not been removed around
the cannon the men moved still more briskly and busily no one any
longer took notice of pierre once or twice he was shouted at for being
in the way the senior officer moved with big rapid strides from one
gun to another with a frowning face the young officer with his face
still more flushed commanded the men more scrupulously than ever the
soldiers handed up the charges turned loaded and did their business
with strained smartness they gave little jumps as they walked as
though they were on springs

the stormcloud had come upon them and in every face the fire which
pierre had watched kindle burned up brightly pierre standing beside the
commanding officer the young officer his hand to his shako ran up to
his superior

i have the honor to report sir that only eight rounds are left are
we to continue firing he asked

grapeshot the senior shouted without answering the question looking
over the wall of the trench

suddenly something happened the young officer gave a gasp and bending
double sat down on the ground like a bird shot on the wing everything
became strange confused and misty in pierres eyes

one cannon ball after another whistled by and struck the earthwork a
soldier or a gun pierre who had not noticed these sounds before now
heard nothing else on the right of the battery soldiers shouting
hurrah were running not forwards but backwards it seemed to pierre

a cannon ball struck the very end of the earth work by which he was
standing crumbling down the earth a black ball flashed before his eyes
and at the same instant plumped into something some militiamen who were
entering the battery ran back

all with grapeshot shouted the officer

the sergeant ran up to the officer and in a frightened whisper informed
him as a butler at dinner informs his master that there is no more of
some wine asked for that there were no more charges

the scoundrels what are they doing shouted the officer turning to
pierre

the officers face was red and perspiring and his eyes glittered under
his frowning brow

run to the reserves and bring up the ammunition boxes he yelled
angrily avoiding pierre with his eyes and speaking to his men

ill go said pierre

the officer without answering him strode across to the opposite side

dont fire wait he shouted

the man who had been ordered to go for ammunition stumbled against
pierre

eh sir this is no place for you said he and ran down the slope

pierre ran after him avoiding the spot where the young officer was
sitting

one cannon ball another and a third flew over him falling in front
beside and behind him pierre ran down the slope where am i going
he suddenly asked himself when he was already near the green ammunition
wagons he halted irresolutely not knowing whether to return or go on
suddenly a terrible concussion threw him backwards to the ground at the
same instant he was dazzled by a great flash of flame and immediately a
deafening roar crackling and whistling made his ears tingle

when he came to himself he was sitting on the ground leaning on his
hands the ammunition wagons he had been approaching no longer existed
only charred green boards and rags littered the scorched grass and a
horse dangling fragments of its shaft behind it galloped past while
another horse lay like pierre on the ground uttering prolonged and
piercing cries





chapter xxxii

beside himself with terror pierre jumped up and ran back to the battery
as to the only refuge from the horrors that surrounded him

on entering the earthwork he noticed that there were men doing something
there but that no shots were being fired from the battery he had no
time to realize who these men were he saw the senior officer lying on
the earth wall with his back turned as if he were examining something
down below and that one of the soldiers he had noticed before was
struggling forward shouting brothers and trying to free himself from
some men who were holding him by the arm he also saw something else
that was strange

but he had not time to realize that the colonel had been killed that
the soldier shouting brothers was a prisoner and that another man
had been bayoneted in the back before his eyes for hardly had he run
into the redoubt before a thin sallowfaced perspiring man in a blue
uniform rushed on him sword in hand shouting something instinctively
guarding against the shockfor they had been running together at full
speed before they saw one anotherpierre put out his hands and seized
the man a french officer by the shoulder with one hand and by the
throat with the other the officer dropping his sword seized pierre by
his collar

for some seconds they gazed with frightened eyes at one anothers
unfamiliar faces and both were perplexed at what they had done and what
they were to do next am i taken prisoner or have i taken him
prisoner each was thinking but the french officer was evidently more
inclined to think he had been taken prisoner because pierres strong
hand impelled by instinctive fear squeezed his throat ever tighter and
tighter the frenchman was about to say something when just above their
heads terrible and low a cannon ball whistled and it seemed to pierre
that the french officers head had been torn off so swiftly had he
ducked it

pierre too bent his head and let his hands fall without further thought
as to who had taken whom prisoner the frenchman ran back to the battery
and pierre ran down the slope stumbling over the dead and wounded who
it seemed to him caught at his feet but before he reached the foot of
the knoll he was met by a dense crowd of russian soldiers who
stumbling tripping up and shouting ran merrily and wildly toward the
battery this was the attack for which ermolov claimed the credit
declaring that only his courage and good luck made such a feat possible
it was the attack in which he was said to have thrown some st georges
crosses he had in his pocket into the battery for the first soldiers to
take who got there

the french who had occupied the battery fled and our troops shouting
hurrah pursued them so far beyond the battery that it was difficult
to call them back

the prisoners were brought down from the battery and among them was a
wounded french general whom the officers surrounded crowds of
woundedsome known to pierre and some unknownrussians and french with
faces distorted by suffering walked crawled and were carried on
stretchers from the battery pierre again went up onto the knoll where
he had spent over an hour and of that family circle which had received
him as a member he did not find a single one there were many dead whom
he did not know but some he recognized the young officer still sat in
the same way bent double in a pool of blood at the edge of the earth
wall the redfaced man was still twitching but they did not carry him
away

pierre ran down the slope once more

now they will stop it now they will be horrified at what they have
done he thought aimlessly going toward a crowd of stretcher bearers
moving from the battlefield

but behind the veil of smoke the sun was still high and in front and
especially to the left near semënovsk something seemed to be seething
in the smoke and the roar of cannon and musketry did not diminish but
even increased to desperation like a man who straining himself shrieks
with all his remaining strength





chapter xxxiii

the chief action of the battle of borodino was fought within the seven
thousand feet between borodino and bagrations fleches beyond that
space there was on the one side a demonstration made by the russians
with uvarovs cavalry at midday and on the other side beyond utitsa
poniatowskis collision with tuchkov but these two were detached and
feeble actions in comparison with what took place in the center of the
battlefield on the field between borodino and the fleches beside the
wood the chief action of the day took place on an open space visible
from both sides and was fought in the simplest and most artless way

the battle began on both sides with a cannonade from several hundred
guns

then when the whole field was covered with smoke two divisions
campans and dessaixs advanced from the french right while murats
troops advanced on borodino from their left

from the shevardino redoubt where napoleon was standing the fleches were
two thirds of a mile away and it was more than a mile as the crow flies
to borodino so that napoleon could not see what was happening there
especially as the smoke mingling with the mist hid the whole locality
the soldiers of dessaixs division advancing against the fleches could
only be seen till they had entered the hollow that lay between them and
the fleches as soon as they had descended into that hollow the smoke
of the guns and musketry on the fleches grew so dense that it covered
the whole approach on that side of it through the smoke glimpses could
be caught of something blackprobably menand at times the glint of
bayonets but whether they were moving or stationary whether they were
french or russian could not be discovered from the shevardino redoubt

the sun had risen brightly and its slanting rays struck straight into
napoleons face as shading his eyes with his hand he looked at the
fleches the smoke spread out before them and at times it looked as if
the smoke were moving at times as if the troops moved sometimes shouts
were heard through the firing but it was impossible to tell what was
being done there

napoleon standing on the knoll looked through a field glass and in
its small circlet saw smoke and men sometimes his own and sometimes
russians but when he looked again with the naked eye he could not tell
where what he had seen was

he descended the knoll and began walking up and down before it

occasionally he stopped listened to the firing and gazed intently at
the battlefield

but not only was it impossible to make out what was happening from where
he was standing down below or from the knoll above on which some of his
generals had taken their stand but even from the fleches themselvesin
which by this time there were now russian and now french soldiers
alternately or together dead wounded alive frightened or
maddenedeven at those fleches themselves it was impossible to make out
what was taking place there for several hours amid incessant cannon and
musketry fire now russians were seen alone now frenchmen alone now
infantry and now cavalry they appeared fired fell collided not
knowing what to do with one another screamed and ran back again

from the battlefield adjutants he had sent out and orderlies from his
marshals kept galloping up to napoleon with reports of the progress of
the action but all these reports were false both because it was
impossible in the heat of battle to say what was happening at any given
moment and because many of the adjutants did not go to the actual place
of conflict but reported what they had heard from others and also
because while an adjutant was riding more than a mile to napoleon
circumstances changed and the news he brought was already becoming
false thus an adjutant galloped up from murat with tidings that
borodino had been occupied and the bridge over the kolocha was in the
hands of the french the adjutant asked whether napoleon wished the
troops to cross it napoleon gave orders that the troops should form up
on the farther side and wait but before that order was givenalmost as
soon in fact as the adjutant had left borodinothe bridge had been
retaken by the russians and burned in the very skirmish at which pierre
had been present at the beginning of the battle

an adjutant galloped up from the fleches with a pale and frightened face
and reported to napoleon that their attack had been repulsed campan
wounded and davout killed yet at the very time the adjutant had been
told that the french had been repulsed the fleches had in fact been
recaptured by other french troops and davout was alive and only
slightly bruised on the basis of these necessarily untrustworthy
reports napoleon gave his orders which had either been executed before
he gave them or could not be and were not executed

the marshals and generals who were nearer to the field of battle but
like napoleon did not take part in the actual fighting and only
occasionally went within musket range made their own arrangements
without asking napoleon and issued orders where and in what direction to
fire and where cavalry should gallop and infantry should run but even
their orders like napoleons were seldom carried out and then but
partially for the most part things happened contrary to their orders
soldiers ordered to advance ran back on meeting grapeshot soldiers
ordered to remain where they were suddenly seeing russians
unexpectedly before them sometimes rushed back and sometimes forward
and the cavalry dashed without orders in pursuit of the flying russians
in this way two cavalry regiments galloped through the semënovsk hollow
and as soon as they reached the top of the incline turned round and
galloped full speed back again the infantry moved in the same way
sometimes running to quite other places than those they were ordered to
go to all orders as to where and when to move the guns when to send
infantry to shoot or horsemen to ride down the russian infantryall such
orders were given by the officers on the spot nearest to the units
concerned without asking either ney davout or murat much less
napoleon they did not fear getting into trouble for not fulfilling
orders or for acting on their own initiative for in battle what is at
stake is what is dearest to manhis own lifeand it sometimes seems that
safety lies in running back sometimes in running forward and these men
who were right in the heat of the battle acted according to the mood of
the moment in reality however all these movements forward and
backward did not improve or alter the position of the troops all their
rushing and galloping at one another did little harm the harm of
disablement and death was caused by the balls and bullets that flew over
the fields on which these men were floundering about as soon as they
left the place where the balls and bullets were flying about their
superiors located in the background reformed them and brought them
under discipline and under the influence of that discipline led them
back to the zone of fire where under the influence of fear of death
they lost their discipline and rushed about according to the chance
promptings of the throng





chapter xxxiv

napoleons generalsdavout ney and murat who were near that region of
fire and sometimes even entered itrepeatedly led into it huge masses of
wellordered troops but contrary to what had always happened in their
former battles instead of the news they expected of the enemys flight
these orderly masses returned thence as disorganized and terrified mobs
the generals reformed them but their numbers constantly decreased in
the middle of the day murat sent his adjutant to napoleon to demand
reinforcements

napoleon sat at the foot of the knoll drinking punch when murats
adjutant galloped up with an assurance that the russians would be routed
if his majesty would let him have another division

reinforcements said napoleon in a tone of stern surprise looking at
the adjutanta handsome lad with long black curls arranged like murats
ownas though he did not understand his words

reinforcements thought napoleon to himself how can they need
reinforcements when they already have half the army directed against a
weak unentrenched russian wing

tell the king of naples said he sternly that it is not noon yet
and i dont yet see my chessboard clearly go

the handsome boy adjutant with the long hair sighed deeply without
removing his hand from his hat and galloped back to where men were being
slaughtered

napoleon rose and having summoned caulaincourt and berthier began
talking to them about matters unconnected with the battle

in the midst of this conversation which was beginning to interest
napoleon berthiers eyes turned to look at a general with a suite who
was galloping toward the knoll on a lathering horse it was belliard
having dismounted he went up to the emperor with rapid strides and in a
loud voice began boldly demonstrating the necessity of sending
reinforcements he swore on his honor that the russians were lost if the
emperor would give another division

napoleon shrugged his shoulders and continued to pace up and down
without replying belliard began talking loudly and eagerly to the
generals of the suite around him

you are very fiery belliard said napoleon when he again came up to
the general in the heat of a battle it is easy to make a mistake go
and have another look and then come back to me

before belliard was out of sight a messenger from another part of the
battlefield galloped up

now then what do you want asked napoleon in the tone of a man
irritated at being continually disturbed

sire the prince began the adjutant

asks for reinforcements said napoleon with an angry gesture

the adjutant bent his head affirmatively and began to report but the
emperor turned from him took a couple of steps stopped came back and
called berthier

we must give reserves he said moving his arms slightly apart who
do you think should be sent there he asked of berthier whom he
subsequently termed that gosling i have made an eagle

send claparedes division sire replied berthier who knew all the
divisions regiments and battalions by heart

napoleon nodded assent

the adjutant galloped to claparedes division and a few minutes later
the young guards stationed behind the knoll moved forward napoleon
gazed silently in that direction

no he suddenly said to berthier i cant send claparede send
friants division

though there was no advantage in sending friants division instead of
claparedes and even an obvious inconvenience and delay in stopping
claparede and sending friant now the order was carried out exactly
napoleon did not notice that in regard to his army he was playing the
part of a doctor who hinders by his medicinesa role he so justly
understood and condemned

friants division disappeared as the others had done into the smoke of
the battlefield from all sides adjutants continued to arrive at a
gallop and as if by agreement all said the same thing they all asked
for reinforcements and all said that the russians were holding their
positions and maintaining a hellish fire under which the french army was
melting away

napoleon sat on a campstool wrapped in thought

m de beausset the man so fond of travel having fasted since morning
came up to the emperor and ventured respectfully to suggest lunch to his
majesty

i hope i may now congratulate your majesty on a victory said he

napoleon silently shook his head in negation assuming the negation to
refer only to the victory and not to the lunch m de beausset ventured
with respectful jocularity to remark that there is no reason for not
having lunch when one can get it

go away exclaimed napoleon suddenly and morosely and turned aside

a beatific smile of regret repentance and ecstasy beamed on m de
beaussets face and he glided away to the other generals

napoleon was experiencing a feeling of depression like that of an ever
lucky gambler who after recklessly flinging money about and always
winning suddenly just when he has calculated all the chances of the
game finds that the more he considers his play the more surely he
loses

his troops were the same his generals the same the same preparations
had been made the same dispositions and the same proclamation courte
et energique he himself was still the same he knew that and knew that
he was now even more experienced and skillful than before even the
enemy was the same as at austerlitz and friedlandyet the terrible
stroke of his arm had supernaturally become impotent

all the old methods that had been unfailingly crowned with success the
concentration of batteries on one point an attack by reserves to break
the enemys line and a cavalry attack by the men of iron all these
methods had already been employed yet not only was there no victory
but from all sides came the same news of generals killed and wounded of
reinforcements needed of the impossibility of driving back the
russians and of disorganization among his own troops

formerly after he had given two or three orders and uttered a few
phrases marshals and adjutants had come galloping up with
congratulations and happy faces announcing the trophies taken the
corps of prisoners bundles of enemy eagles and standards cannon and
stores and murat had only begged leave to loose the cavalry to gather
in the baggage wagons so it had been at lodi marengo arcola jena
austerlitz wagram and so on but now something strange was happening
to his troops

despite news of the capture of the fleches napoleon saw that this was
not the same not at all the same as what had happened in his former
battles he saw that what he was feeling was felt by all the men about
him experienced in the art of war all their faces looked dejected and
they all shunned one anothers eyesonly a de beausset could fail to
grasp the meaning of what was happening

but napoleon with his long experience of war well knew the meaning of a
battle not gained by the attacking side in eight hours after all
efforts had been expended he knew that it was a lost battle and that
the least accident might nowwith the fight balanced on such a strained
centerdestroy him and his army

when he ran his mind over the whole of this strange russian campaign in
which not one battle had been won and in which not a flag or cannon
or army corps had been captured in two months when he looked at the
concealed depression on the faces around him and heard reports of the
russians still holding their grounda terrible feeling like a nightmare
took possession of him and all the unlucky accidents that might destroy
him occurred to his mind the russians might fall on his left wing
might break through his center he himself might be killed by a stray
cannon ball all this was possible in former battles he had only
considered the possibilities of success but now innumerable unlucky
chances presented themselves and he expected them all yes it was like
a dream in which a man fancies that a ruffian is coming to attack him
and raises his arm to strike that ruffian a terrible blow which he knows
should annihilate him but then feels that his arm drops powerless and
limp like a rag and the horror of unavoidable destruction seizes him in
his helplessness

the news that the russians were attacking the left flank of the french
army aroused that horror in napoleon he sat silently on a campstool
below the knoll with head bowed and elbows on his knees berthier
approached and suggested that they should ride along the line to
ascertain the position of affairs

what what do you say asked napoleon yes tell them to bring me my
horse

he mounted and rode toward semënovsk

amid the powder smoke slowly dispersing over the whole space through
which napoleon rode horses and men were lying in pools of blood singly
or in heaps neither napoleon nor any of his generals had ever before
seen such horrors or so many slain in such a small area the roar of
guns that had not ceased for ten hours wearied the ear and gave a
peculiar significance to the spectacle as music does to tableaux
vivants napoleon rode up the high ground at semënovsk and through the
smoke saw ranks of men in uniforms of a color unfamiliar to him they
were russians

the russians stood in serried ranks behind semënovsk village and its
knoll and their guns boomed incessantly along their line and sent forth
clouds of smoke it was no longer a battle it was a continuous
slaughter which could be of no avail either to the french or the
russians napoleon stopped his horse and again fell into the reverie
from which berthier had aroused him he could not stop what was going on
before him and around him and was supposed to be directed by him and to
depend on him and from its lack of success this affair for the first
time seemed to him unnecessary and horrible

one of the generals rode up to napoleon and ventured to offer to lead
the old guard into action ney and berthier standing near napoleon
exchanged looks and smiled contemptuously at this generals senseless
offer

napoleon bowed his head and remained silent a long time

at eight hundred leagues from france i will not have my guard
destroyed he said and turning his horse rode back to shevardino





chapter xxxv

on the rugcovered bench where pierre had seen him in the morning sat
kutúzov his gray head hanging his heavy body relaxed he gave no
orders but only assented to or dissented from what others suggested

yes yes do that he replied to various proposals yes yes go
dear boy and have a look he would say to one or another of those
about him or no dont wed better wait he listened to the reports
that were brought him and gave directions when his subordinates demanded
that of him but when listening to the reports it seemed as if he were
not interested in the import of the words spoken but rather in
something elsein the expression of face and tone of voice of those who
were reporting by long years of military experience he knew and with
the wisdom of age understood that it is impossible for one man to
direct hundreds of thousands of others struggling with death and he
knew that the result of a battle is decided not by the orders of a
commanderinchief nor the place where the troops are stationed nor by
the number of cannon or of slaughtered men but by that intangible force
called the spirit of the army and he watched this force and guided it
in as far as that was in his power

kutúzovs general expression was one of concentrated quiet attention
and his face wore a strained look as if he found it difficult to master
the fatigue of his old and feeble body

at eleven oclock they brought him news that the fleches captured by the
french had been retaken but that prince bagration was wounded kutúzov
groaned and swayed his head

ride over to prince peter ivánovich and find out about it exactly he
said to one of his adjutants and then turned to the duke of wurttemberg
who was standing behind him

will your highness please take command of the first army

soon after the dukes departurebefore he could possibly have reached
semënovskhis adjutant came back from him and told kutúzov that the duke
asked for more troops

kutúzov made a grimace and sent an order to dokhturov to take over the
command of the first army and a request to the dukewhom he said he
could not spare at such an important momentto return to him when they
brought him news that murat had been taken prisoner and the staff
officers congratulated him kutúzov smiled

wait a little gentlemen said he the battle is won and there is
nothing extraordinary in the capture of murat still it is better to
wait before we rejoice

but he sent an adjutant to take the news round the army

when scherbinin came galloping from the left flank with news that the
french had captured the fleches and the village of semënovsk kutúzov
guessing by the sounds of the battle and by scherbinins looks that the
news was bad rose as if to stretch his legs and taking scherbinins
arm led him aside

go my dear fellow he said to ermolov and see whether something
cant be done

kutúzov was in gorki near the center of the russian position the
attack directed by napoleon against our left flank had been several
times repulsed in the center the french had not got beyond borodino
and on their left flank uvarovs cavalry had put the french to flight

toward three oclock the french attacks ceased on the faces of all who
came from the field of battle and of those who stood around him
kutúzov noticed an expression of extreme tension he was satisfied with
the days successa success exceeding his expectations but the old
mans strength was failing him several times his head dropped low as if
it were falling and he dozed off dinner was brought him

adjutant general wolzogen the man who when riding past prince andrew
had said the war should be extended widely and whom bagration so
detested rode up while kutúzov was at dinner wolzogen had come from
barclay de tolly to report on the progress of affairs on the left flank
the sagacious barclay de tolly seeing crowds of wounded men running
back and the disordered rear of the army weighed all the circumstances
concluded that the battle was lost and sent his favorite officer to the
commander in chief with that news

kutúzov was chewing a piece of roast chicken with difficulty and glanced
at wolzogen with eyes that brightened under their puckering lids

wolzogen nonchalantly stretching his legs approached kutúzov with a
halfcontemptuous smile on his lips scarcely touching the peak of his
cap

he treated his serene highness with a somewhat affected nonchalance
intended to show that as a highly trained military man he left it to
russians to make an idol of this useless old man but that he knew whom
he was dealing with der alte herr as in their own set the germans
called kutúzov is making himself very comfortable thought wolzogen
and looking severely at the dishes in front of kutúzov he began to
report to the old gentleman the position of affairs on the left flank
as barclay had ordered him to and as he himself had seen and understood
it

all the points of our position are in the enemys hands and we cannot
dislodge them for lack of troops the men are running away and it is
impossible to stop them he reported

kutúzov ceased chewing and fixed an astonished gaze on wolzogen as if
not understanding what was said to him wolzogen noticing the old
gentlemans agitation said with a smile

i have not considered it right to conceal from your serene highness
what i have seen the troops are in complete disorder

you have seen you have seen kutúzov shouted frowning and rising
quickly he went up to wolzogen

how how dare you he shouted choking and making a threatening
gesture with his trembling arms how dare you sir say that to me you
know nothing about it tell general barclay from me that his information
is incorrect and that the real course of the battle is better known to
me the commanderinchief than to him

wolzogen was about to make a rejoinder but kutúzov interrupted him

the enemy has been repulsed on the left and defeated on the right
flank if you have seen amiss sir do not allow yourself to say what
you dont know be so good as to ride to general barclay and inform him
of my firm intention to attack the enemy tomorrow said kutúzov
sternly

all were silent and the only sound audible was the heavy breathing of
the panting old general

they are repulsed everywhere for which i thank god and our brave army
the enemy is beaten and tomorrow we shall drive him from the sacred
soil of russia said kutúzov crossing himself and he suddenly sobbed
as his eyes filled with tears

wolzogen shrugging his shoulders and curling his lips stepped silently
aside marveling at the old gentlemans conceited stupidity

ah here he is my hero said kutúzov to a portly handsome dark
haired general who was just ascending the knoll

this was raevski who had spent the whole day at the most important part
of the field of borodino

raevski reported that the troops were firmly holding their ground and
that the french no longer ventured to attack

after hearing him kutúzov said in french

then you do not think like some others that we must retreat

on the contrary your highness in indecisive actions it is always the
most stubborn who remain victors replied raevski and in my
opinion

kaysarov kutúzov called to his adjutant sit down and write out the
order of the day for tomorrow and you he continued addressing
another ride along the line and announce that tomorrow we attack

while kutúzov was talking to raevski and dictating the order of the day
wolzogen returned from barclay and said that general barclay wished to
have written confirmation of the order the field marshal had given

kutúzov without looking at wolzogen gave directions for the order to
be written out which the former commanderinchief to avoid personal
responsibility very judiciously wished to receive

and by means of that mysterious indefinable bond which maintains
throughout an army one and the same temper known as the spirit of the
army and which constitutes the sinew of war kutúzovs words his
order for a battle next day immediately became known from one end of
the army to the other

it was far from being the same words or the same order that reached the
farthest links of that chain the tales passing from mouth to mouth at
different ends of the army did not even resemble what kutúzov had said
but the sense of his words spread everywhere because what he said was
not the outcome of cunning calculations but of a feeling that lay in
the commanderinchiefs soul as in that of every russian

and on learning that tomorrow they were to attack the enemy and hearing
from the highest quarters a confirmation of what they wanted to believe
the exhausted wavering men felt comforted and inspirited





chapter xxxvi

prince andrews regiment was among the reserves which till after one
oclock were stationed inactive behind semënovsk under heavy artillery
fire toward two oclock the regiment having already lost more than two
hundred men was moved forward into a trampled oatfield in the gap
between semënovsk and the knoll battery where thousands of men perished
that day and on which an intense concentrated fire from several hundred
enemy guns was directed between one and two oclock

without moving from that spot or firing a single shot the regiment here
lost another third of its men from in front and especially from the
right in the unlifting smoke the guns boomed and out of the mysterious
domain of smoke that overlay the whole space in front quick hissing
cannon balls and slow whistling shells flew unceasingly at times as if
to allow them a respite a quarter of an hour passed during which the
cannon balls and shells all flew overhead but sometimes several men
were torn from the regiment in a minute and the slain were continually
being dragged away and the wounded carried off

with each fresh blow less and less chance of life remained for those not
yet killed the regiment stood in columns of battalion three hundred
paces apart but nevertheless the men were always in one and the same
mood all alike were taciturn and morose talk was rarely heard in the
ranks and it ceased altogether every time the thud of a successful shot
and the cry of stretchers was heard most of the time by their
officers order the men sat on the ground one having taken off his
shako carefully loosened the gathers of its lining and drew them tight
again another rubbing some dry clay between his palms polished his
bayonet another fingered the strap and pulled the buckle of his
bandolier while another smoothed and refolded his leg bands and put his
boots on again some built little houses of the tufts in the plowed
ground or plaited baskets from the straw in the cornfield all seemed
fully absorbed in these pursuits when men were killed or wounded when
rows of stretchers went past when some troops retreated and when great
masses of the enemy came into view through the smoke no one paid any
attention to these things but when our artillery or cavalry advanced or
some of our infantry were seen to move forward words of approval were
heard on all sides but the liveliest attention was attracted by
occurrences quite apart from and unconnected with the battle it was
as if the minds of these morally exhausted men found relief in everyday
commonplace occurrences a battery of artillery was passing in front of
the regiment the horse of an ammunition cart put its leg over a trace
hey look at the trace horse get her leg out shell fall ah
they dont see it came identical shouts from the ranks all along the
regiment another time general attention was attracted by a small brown
dog coming heaven knows whence which trotted in a preoccupied manner
in front of the ranks with tail stiffly erect till suddenly a shell fell
close by when it yelped tucked its tail between its legs and darted
aside yells and shrieks of laughter rose from the whole regiment but
such distractions lasted only a moment and for eight hours the men had
been inactive without food in constant fear of death and their pale
and gloomy faces grew ever paler and gloomier

prince andrew pale and gloomy like everyone in the regiment paced up
and down from the border of one patch to another at the edge of the
meadow beside an oatfield with head bowed and arms behind his back
there was nothing for him to do and no orders to be given everything
went on of itself the killed were dragged from the front the wounded
carried away and the ranks closed up if any soldiers ran to the rear
they returned immediately and hastily at first prince andrew
considering it his duty to rouse the courage of the men and to set them
an example walked about among the ranks but he soon became convinced
that this was unnecessary and that there was nothing he could teach
them all the powers of his soul as of every soldier there were
unconsciously bent on avoiding the contemplation of the horrors of their
situation he walked along the meadow dragging his feet rustling the
grass and gazing at the dust that covered his boots now he took big
strides trying to keep to the footprints left on the meadow by the
mowers then he counted his steps calculating how often he must walk
from one strip to another to walk a mile then he stripped the flowers
from the wormwood that grew along a boundary rut rubbed them in his
palms and smelled their pungent sweetly bitter scent nothing remained
of the previous days thoughts he thought of nothing he listened with
weary ears to the everrecurring sounds distinguishing the whistle of
flying projectiles from the booming of the reports glanced at the
tiresomely familiar faces of the men of the first battalion and waited
here it comes this one is coming our way again he thought
listening to an approaching whistle in the hidden region of smoke one
another again it has hit he stopped and looked at the ranks no
it has gone over but this one has hit and again he started trying to
reach the boundary strip in sixteen paces a whizz and a thud five
paces from him a cannon ball tore up the dry earth and disappeared a
chill ran down his back again he glanced at the ranks probably many
had been hita large crowd had gathered near the second battalion

adjutant he shouted order them not to crowd together

the adjutant having obeyed this instruction approached prince andrew
from the other side a battalion commander rode up

look out came a frightened cry from a soldier and like a bird
whirring in rapid flight and alighting on the ground a shell dropped
with little noise within two steps of prince andrew and close to the
battalion commanders horse the horse first regardless of whether it
was right or wrong to show fear snorted reared almost throwing the
major and galloped aside the horses terror infected the men

lie down cried the adjutant throwing himself flat on the ground

prince andrew hesitated the smoking shell spun like a top between him
and the prostrate adjutant near a wormwood plant between the field and
the meadow

can this be death thought prince andrew looking with a quite new
envious glance at the grass the wormwood and the streamlet of smoke
that curled up from the rotating black ball i cannot i do not wish to
die i love lifei love this grass this earth this air he thought
this and at the same time remembered that people were looking at him

its shameful sir he said to the adjutant what

he did not finish speaking at one and the same moment came the sound of
an explosion a whistle of splinters as from a breaking window frame a
suffocating smell of powder and prince andrew started to one side
raising his arm and fell on his chest several officers ran up to him
from the right side of his abdomen blood was welling out making a large
stain on the grass

the militiamen with stretchers who were called up stood behind the
officers prince andrew lay on his chest with his face in the grass
breathing heavily and noisily

what are you waiting for come along

the peasants went up and took him by his shoulders and legs but he
moaned piteously and exchanging looks they set him down again

pick him up lift him its all the same cried someone

they again took him by the shoulders and laid him on the stretcher

ah god my god what is it the stomach that means death my
godvoices among the officers were heard saying

it flew a hairs breadth past my ear said the adjutant

the peasants adjusting the stretcher to their shoulders started
hurriedly along the path they had trodden down to the dressing station

keep in step ah those peasants shouted an officer seizing by
their shoulders and checking the peasants who were walking unevenly and
jolting the stretcher

get into step fedor i say fedor said the foremost peasant

now thats right said the one behind joyfully when he had got into
step

your excellency eh prince said the trembling voice of timokhin who
had run up and was looking down on the stretcher

prince andrew opened his eyes and looked up at the speaker from the
stretcher into which his head had sunk deep and again his eyelids
drooped

the militiamen carried prince andrew to the dressing station by the
wood where wagons were stationed the dressing station consisted of
three tents with flaps turned back pitched at the edge of a birch wood
in the wood wagons and horses were standing the horses were eating
oats from their movable troughs and sparrows flew down and pecked the
grains that fell some crows scenting blood flew among the birch trees
cawing impatiently around the tents over more than five acres
bloodstained men in various garbs stood sat or lay around the wounded
stood crowds of soldier stretcherbearers with dismal and attentive
faces whom the officers keeping order tried in vain to drive from the
spot disregarding the officers orders the soldiers stood leaning
against their stretchers and gazing intently as if trying to comprehend
the difficult problem of what was taking place before them from the
tents came now loud angry cries and now plaintive groans occasionally
dressers ran out to fetch water or to point out those who were to be
brought in next the wounded men awaiting their turn outside the tents
groaned sighed wept screamed swore or asked for vodka some were
delirious prince andrews bearers stepping over the wounded who had
not yet been bandaged took him as a regimental commander close up to
one of the tents and there stopped awaiting instructions prince andrew
opened his eyes and for a long time could not make out what was going on
around him he remembered the meadow the wormwood the field the
whirling black ball and his sudden rush of passionate love of life two
steps from him leaning against a branch and talking loudly and
attracting general attention stood a tall handsome blackhaired
noncommissioned officer with a bandaged head he had been wounded in the
head and leg by bullets around him eagerly listening to his talk a
crowd of wounded and stretcherbearers was gathered

we kicked him out from there so that he chucked everything we grabbed
the king himself cried he looking around him with eyes that glittered
with fever if only reserves had come up just then lads there
wouldnt have been nothing left of him i tell you surely

like all the others near the speaker prince andrew looked at him with
shining eyes and experienced a sense of comfort but isnt it all the
same now thought he and what will be there and what has there been
here why was i so reluctant to part with life there was something in
this life i did not and do not understand





chapter xxxvii

one of the doctors came out of the tent in a bloodstained apron holding
a cigar between the thumb and little finger of one of his small
bloodstained hands so as not to smear it he raised his head and looked
about him but above the level of the wounded men he evidently wanted a
little respite after turning his head from right to left for some time
he sighed and looked down

all right immediately he replied to a dresser who pointed prince
andrew out to him and he told them to carry him into the tent

murmurs arose among the wounded who were waiting

it seems that even in the next world only the gentry are to have a
chance remarked one

prince andrew was carried in and laid on a table that had only just been
cleared and which a dresser was washing down prince andrew could not
make out distinctly what was in that tent the pitiful groans from all
sides and the torturing pain in his thigh stomach and back distracted
him all he saw about him merged into a general impression of naked
bleeding human bodies that seemed to fill the whole of the low tent as
a few weeks previously on that hot august day such bodies had filled
the dirty pond beside the smolensk road yes it was the same flesh the
same chair a canon the sight of which had even then filled him with
horror as by a presentiment

there were three operating tables in the tent two were occupied and on
the third they placed prince andrew for a little while he was left
alone and involuntarily witnessed what was taking place on the other two
tables on the nearest one sat a tartar probably a cossack judging by
the uniform thrown down beside him four soldiers were holding him and
a spectacled doctor was cutting into his muscular brown back

ooh ooh ooh grunted the tartar and suddenly lifting up his swarthy
snubnosed face with its high cheekbones and baring his white teeth he
began to wriggle and twitch his body and utter piercing ringing and
prolonged yells on the other table round which many people were
crowding a tall wellfed man lay on his back with his head thrown back
his curly hair its color and the shape of his head seemed strangely
familiar to prince andrew several dressers were pressing on his chest
to hold him down one large white plump leg twitched rapidly all the
time with a feverish tremor the man was sobbing and choking
convulsively two doctorsone of whom was pale and tremblingwere
silently doing something to this mans other gory leg when he had
finished with the tartar whom they covered with an overcoat the
spectacled doctor came up to prince andrew wiping his hands

he glanced at prince andrews face and quickly turned away

undress him what are you waiting for he cried angrily to the
dressers

his very first remotest recollections of childhood came back to prince
andrews mind when the dresser with sleeves rolled up began hastily to
undo the buttons of his clothes and undressed him the doctor bent down
over the wound felt it and sighed deeply then he made a sign to
someone and the torturing pain in his abdomen caused prince andrew to
lose consciousness when he came to himself the splintered portions of
his thighbone had been extracted the torn flesh cut away and the wound
bandaged water was being sprinkled on his face as soon as prince
andrew opened his eyes the doctor bent over kissed him silently on the
lips and hurried away

after the sufferings he had been enduring prince andrew enjoyed a
blissful feeling such as he had not experienced for a long time all the
best and happiest moments of his lifeespecially his earliest childhood
when he used to be undressed and put to bed and when leaning over him
his nurse sang him to sleep and he burying his head in the pillow felt
happy in the mere consciousness of lifereturned to his memory not
merely as something past but as something present

the doctors were busily engaged with the wounded man the shape of whose
head seemed familiar to prince andrew they were lifting him up and
trying to quiet him

show it to me oh ooh oh oh ooh his frightened moans could
be heard subdued by suffering and broken by sobs

hearing those moans prince andrew wanted to weep whether because he was
dying without glory or because he was sorry to part with life or
because of those memories of a childhood that could not return or
because he was suffering and others were suffering and that man near him
was groaning so piteouslyhe felt like weeping childlike kindly and
almost happy tears

the wounded man was shown his amputated leg stained with clotted blood
and with the boot still on

oh oh ooh he sobbed like a woman

the doctor who had been standing beside him preventing prince andrew
from seeing his face moved away

my god what is this why is he here said prince andrew to himself

in the miserable sobbing enfeebled man whose leg had just been
amputated he recognized anatole kurágin men were supporting him in
their arms and offering him a glass of water but his trembling swollen
lips could not grasp its rim anatole was sobbing painfully yes it is
he yes that man is somehow closely and painfully connected with me
thought prince andrew not yet clearly grasping what he saw before him
what is the connection of that man with my childhood and life he
asked himself without finding an answer and suddenly a new unexpected
memory from that realm of pure and loving childhood presented itself to
him he remembered natásha as he had seen her for the first time at the
ball in  with her slender neck and arms and with a frightened happy
face ready for rapture and love and tenderness for her stronger and
more vivid than ever awoke in his soul he now remembered the
connection that existed between himself and this man who was dimly
gazing at him through tears that filled his swollen eyes he remembered
everything and ecstatic pity and love for that man overflowed his happy
heart

prince andrew could no longer restrain himself and wept tender loving
tears for his fellow men for himself and for his own and their errors

compassion love of our brothers for those who love us and for those
who hate us love of our enemies yes that love which god preached on
earth and which princess mary taught me and i did not understandthat is
what made me sorry to part with life that is what remained for me had i
lived but now it is too late i know it





chapter xxxviii

the terrible spectacle of the battlefield covered with dead and wounded
together with the heaviness of his head and the news that some twenty
generals he knew personally had been killed or wounded and the
consciousness of the impotence of his once mighty arm produced an
unexpected impression on napoleon who usually liked to look at the
killed and wounded thereby he considered testing his strength of
mind this day the horrible appearance of the battlefield overcame that
strength of mind which he thought constituted his merit and his
greatness he rode hurriedly from the battlefield and returned to the
shevardino knoll where he sat on his campstool his sallow face swollen
and heavy his eyes dim his nose red and his voice hoarse
involuntarily listening with downcast eyes to the sounds of firing
with painful dejection he awaited the end of this action in which he
regarded himself as a participant and which he was unable to arrest a
personal human feeling for a brief moment got the better of the
artificial phantasm of life he had served so long he felt in his own
person the sufferings and death he had witnessed on the battlefield the
heaviness of his head and chest reminded him of the possibility of
suffering and death for himself at that moment he did not desire
moscow or victory or glory what need had he for any more glory the
one thing he wished for was rest tranquillity and freedom but when he
had been on the semënovsk heights the artillery commander had proposed
to him to bring several batteries of artillery up to those heights to
strengthen the fire on the russian troops crowded in front of knyazkovo
napoleon had assented and had given orders that news should be brought
to him of the effect those batteries produced

an adjutant came now to inform him that the fire of two hundred guns had
been concentrated on the russians as he had ordered but that they
still held their ground

our fire is mowing them down by rows but still they hold on said the
adjutant

they want more said napoleon in a hoarse voice

sire asked the adjutant who had not heard the remark

they want more croaked napoleon frowning let them have it

even before he gave that order the thing he did not desire and for
which he gave the order only because he thought it was expected of him
was being done and he fell back into that artificial realm of imaginary
greatness and againas a horse walking a treadmill thinks it is doing
something for itselfhe submissively fulfilled the cruel sad gloomy
and inhuman role predestined for him

and not for that day and hour alone were the mind and conscience
darkened of this man on whom the responsibility for what was happening
lay more than on all the others who took part in it never to the end of
his life could he understand goodness beauty or truth or the
significance of his actions which were too contrary to goodness and
truth too remote from everything human for him ever to be able to
grasp their meaning he could not disavow his actions belauded as they
were by half the world and so he had to repudiate truth goodness and
all humanity

not only on that day as he rode over the battlefield strewn with men
killed and maimed by his will as he believed did he reckon as he
looked at them how many russians there were for each frenchman and
deceiving himself find reason for rejoicing in the calculation that
there were five russians for every frenchman not on that day alone did
he write in a letter to paris that the battle field was superb
because fifty thousand corpses lay there but even on the island of st
helena in the peaceful solitude where he said he intended to devote his
leisure to an account of the great deeds he had done he wrote

the russian war should have been the most popular war of modern times
it was a war of good sense for real interests for the tranquillity and
security of all it was purely pacific and conservative

it was a war for a great cause the end of uncertainties and the
beginning of security a new horizon and new labors were opening out
full of wellbeing and prosperity for all the european system was
already founded all that remained was to organize it

satisfied on these great points and with tranquility everywhere i too
should have had my congress and my holy alliance those ideas were
stolen from me in that reunion of great sovereigns we should have
discussed our interests like one family and have rendered account to
the peoples as clerk to master

europe would in this way soon have been in fact but one people and
anyone who traveled anywhere would have found himself always in the
common fatherland i should have demanded the freedom of all navigable
rivers for everybody that the seas should be common to all and that
the great standing armies should be reduced henceforth to mere guards
for the sovereigns

on returning to france to the bosom of the great strong magnificent
peaceful and glorious fatherland i should have proclaimed her
frontiers immutable all future wars purely defensive all
aggrandizement antinational i should have associated my son in the
empire my dictatorship would have been finished and his constitutional
reign would have begun

paris would have been the capital of the world and the french the envy
of the nations

my leisure then and my old age would have been devoted in company
with the empress and during the royal apprenticeship of my son to
leisurely visiting with our own horses and like a true country couple
every corner of the empire receiving complaints redressing wrongs and
scattering public buildings and benefactions on all sides and
everywhere

napoleon predestined by providence for the gloomy role of executioner
of the peoples assured himself that the aim of his actions had been the
peoples welfare and that he could control the fate of millions and by
the employment of power confer benefactions

of four hundred thousand who crossed the vistula he wrote further of
the russian war half were austrians prussians saxons poles
bavarians wurttembergers mecklenburgers spaniards italians and
neapolitans the imperial army strictly speaking was one third
composed of dutch belgians men from the borders of the rhine
piedmontese swiss genevese tuscans romans inhabitants of the
thirtysecond military division of bremen of hamburg and so on it
included scarcely a hundred and forty thousand who spoke french the
russian expedition actually cost france less than fifty thousand men
the russian army in its retreat from vilna to moscow lost in the various
battles four times more men than the french army the burning of moscow
cost the lives of a hundred thousand russians who died of cold and want
in the woods finally in its march from moscow to the oder the russian
army also suffered from the severity of the season so that by the time
it reached vilna it numbered only fifty thousand and at kalisch less
than eighteen thousand

he imagined that the war with russia came about by his will and the
horrors that occurred did not stagger his soul he boldly took the whole
responsibility for what happened and his darkened mind found
justification in the belief that among the hundreds of thousands who
perished there were fewer frenchmen than hessians and bavarians





chapter xxxix

several tens of thousands of the slain lay in diverse postures and
various uniforms on the fields and meadows belonging to the davydov
family and to the crown serfsthose fields and meadows where for
hundreds of years the peasants of borodino gorki shevardino and
semënovsk had reaped their harvests and pastured their cattle at the
dressing stations the grass and earth were soaked with blood for a space
of some three acres around crowds of men of various arms wounded and
unwounded with frightened faces dragged themselves back to mozhaysk
from the one army and back to valuevo from the other other crowds
exhausted and hungry went forward led by their officers others held
their ground and continued to fire

over the whole field previously so gaily beautiful with the glitter of
bayonets and cloudlets of smoke in the morning sun there now spread a
mist of damp and smoke and a strange acid smell of saltpeter and blood
clouds gathered and drops of rain began to fall on the dead and wounded
on the frightened exhausted and hesitating men as if to say enough
men enough cease bethink yourselves what are you doing

to the men of both sides alike worn out by want of food and rest it
began equally to appear doubtful whether they should continue to
slaughter one another all the faces expressed hesitation and the
question arose in every soul for what for whom must i kill and be
killed you may go and kill whom you please but i dont want to do
so anymore by evening this thought had ripened in every soul at any
moment these men might have been seized with horror at what they were
doing and might have thrown up everything and run away anywhere

but though toward the end of the battle the men felt all the horror of
what they were doing though they would have been glad to leave off
some incomprehensible mysterious power continued to control them and
they still brought up the charges loaded aimed and applied the match
though only one artilleryman survived out of every three and though
they stumbled and panted with fatigue perspiring and stained with blood
and powder the cannon balls flew just as swiftly and cruelly from both
sides crushing human bodies and that terrible work which was not done
by the will of a man but at the will of him who governs men and worlds
continued

anyone looking at the disorganized rear of the russian army would have
said that if only the french made one more slight effort it would
disappear and anyone looking at the rear of the french army would have
said that the russians need only make one more slight effort and the
french would be destroyed but neither the french nor the russians made
that effort and the flame of battle burned slowly out

the russians did not make that effort because they were not attacking
the french at the beginning of the battle they stood blocking the way
to moscow and they still did so at the end of the battle as at the
beginning but even had the aim of the russians been to drive the french
from their positions they could not have made this last effort for all
the russian troops had been broken up there was no part of the russian
army that had not suffered in the battle and though still holding their
positions they had lost one half of their army

the french with the memory of all their former victories during fifteen
years with the assurance of napoleons invincibility with the
consciousness that they had captured part of the battlefield and had
lost only a quarter of their men and still had their guards intact
twenty thousand strong might easily have made that effort the french
who had attacked the russian army in order to drive it from its position
ought to have made that effort for as long as the russians continued to
block the road to moscow as before the aim of the french had not been
attained and all their efforts and losses were in vain but the french
did not make that effort some historians say that napoleon need only
have used his old guards who were intact and the battle would have
been won to speak of what would have happened had napoleon sent his
guards is like talking of what would happen if autumn became spring it
could not be napoleon did not give his guards not because he did not
want to but because it could not be done all the generals officers
and soldiers of the french army knew it could not be done because the
flagging spirit of the troops would not permit it

it was not napoleon alone who had experienced that nightmare feeling of
the mighty arm being stricken powerless but all the generals and
soldiers of his army whether they had taken part in the battle or not
after all their experience of previous battleswhen after one tenth of
such efforts the enemy had fledexperienced a similar feeling of terror
before an enemy who after losing half his men stood as threateningly
at the end as at the beginning of the battle the moral force of the
attacking french army was exhausted not that sort of victory which is
defined by the capture of pieces of material fastened to sticks called
standards and of the ground on which the troops had stood and were
standing but a moral victory that convinces the enemy of the moral
superiority of his opponent and of his own impotence was gained by the
russians at borodino the french invaders like an infuriated animal
that has in its onslaught received a mortal wound felt that they were
perishing but could not stop any more than the russian army weaker by
one half could help swerving by impetus gained the french army was
still able to roll forward to moscow but there without further effort
on the part of the russians it had to perish bleeding from the mortal
wound it had received at borodino the direct consequence of the battle
of borodino was napoleons senseless flight from moscow his retreat
along the old smolensk road the destruction of the invading army of
five hundred thousand men and the downfall of napoleonic france on
which at borodino for the first time the hand of an opponent of stronger
spirit had been laid

absolute continuity of motion is not comprehensible to the human mind

examines arbitrarily selected elements of that motion but at the same
time a large proportion of human error comes from the arbitrary
division of continuous motion into discontinuous elements there is a
well known socalled sophism of the ancients consisting in this that
achilles could never catch up with a tortoise he was following in spite
of the fact that he traveled ten times as fast as the tortoise by the
time achilles has covered the distance that separated him from the
tortoise the tortoise has covered one tenth of that distance ahead of
him when achilles has covered that tenth the tortoise has covered
another one hundredth and so on forever this problem seemed to the
ancients insoluble the absurd answer that achilles could never
overtake the tortoise resulted from this that motion was arbitrarily
divided into discontinuous elements whereas the motion both of achilles
and of the tortoise was continuous

by adopting smaller and smaller elements of motion we only approach a
solution of the problem but never reach it only when we have admitted
the conception of the infinitely small and the resulting geometrical
progression with a common ratio of one tenth and have found the sum of
this progression to infinity do we reach a solution of the problem

a modern branch of mathematics having achieved the art of dealing with
the infinitely small can now yield solutions in other more complex
problems of motion which used to appear insoluble

this modern branch of mathematics unknown to the ancients when dealing
with problems of motion admits the conception of the infinitely small
and so conforms to the chief condition of motion absolute continuity
and thereby corrects the inevitable error which the human mind cannot
avoid when it deals with separate elements of motion instead of
examining continuous motion

in seeking the laws of historical movement just the same thing happens
the movement of humanity arising as it does from innumerable arbitrary
human wills is continuous

to understand the laws of this continuous movement is the aim of
history but to arrive at these laws resulting from the sum of all
those human wills mans mind postulates arbitrary and disconnected
units the first method of history is to take an arbitrarily selected
series of continuous events and examine it apart from others though
there is and can be no beginning to any event for one event always
flows uninterruptedly from another

the second method is to consider the actions of some one mana king or a
commanderas equivalent to the sum of many individual wills whereas the
sum of individual wills is never expressed by the activity of a single
historic personage

historical science in its endeavor to draw nearer to truth continually
takes smaller and smaller units for examination but however small the
units it takes we feel that to take any unit disconnected from others
or to assume a beginning of any phenomenon or to say that the will of
many men is expressed by the actions of any one historic personage is
in itself false

it needs no critical exertion to reduce utterly to dust any deductions
drawn from history it is merely necessary to select some larger or
smaller unit as the subject of observationas criticism has every right
to do seeing that whatever unit history observes must always be
arbitrarily selected

only by taking infinitesimally small units for observation the
differential of history that is the individual tendencies of men and
attaining to the art of integrating them that is finding the sum of
these infinitesimals can we hope to arrive at the laws of history

the first fifteen years of the nineteenth century in europe present an
extraordinary movement of millions of people men leave their customary
pursuits hasten from one side of europe to the other plunder and
slaughter one another triumph and are plunged in despair and for some
years the whole course of life is altered and presents an intensive
movement which first increases and then slackens what was the cause of
this movement by what laws was it governed asks the mind of man

the historians replying to this question lay before us the sayings and
doings of a few dozen men in a building in the city of paris calling
these sayings and doings the revolution then they give a detailed
biography of napoleon and of certain people favorable or hostile to him
tell of the influence some of these people had on others and say that
is why this movement took place and those are its laws

but the mind of man not only refuses to believe this explanation but
plainly says that this method of explanation is fallacious because in
it a weaker phenomenon is taken as the cause of a stronger the sum of
human wills produced the revolution and napoleon and only the sum of
those wills first tolerated and then destroyed them

but every time there have been conquests there have been conquerors
every time there has been a revolution in any state there have been
great men says history and indeed human reason replies every time
conquerors appear there have been wars but this does not prove that the
conquerors caused the wars and that it is possible to find the laws of a
war in the personal activity of a single man whenever i look at my
watch and its hands point to ten i hear the bells of the neighboring
church but because the bells begin to ring when the hands of the clock
reach ten i have no right to assume that the movement of the bells is
caused by the position of the hands of the watch

whenever i see the movement of a locomotive i hear the whistle and see
the valves opening and wheels turning but i have no right to conclude
that the whistling and the turning of wheels are the cause of the
movement of the engine

the peasants say that a cold wind blows in late spring because the oaks
are budding and really every spring cold winds do blow when the oak is
budding but though i do not know what causes the cold winds to blow
when the oak buds unfold i cannot agree with the peasants that the
unfolding of the oak buds is the cause of the cold wind for the force
of the wind is beyond the influence of the buds i see only a
coincidence of occurrences such as happens with all the phenomena of
life and i see that however much and however carefully i observe the
hands of the watch and the valves and wheels of the engine and the
oak i shall not discover the cause of the bells ringing the engine
moving or of the winds of spring to that i must entirely change my
point of view and study the laws of the movement of steam of the bells
and of the wind history must do the same and attempts in this
direction have already been made

to study the laws of history we must completely change the subject of
our observation must leave aside kings ministers and generals and
study the common infinitesimally small elements by which the masses are
moved no one can say in how far it is possible for man to advance in
this way toward an understanding of the laws of history but it is
evident that only along that path does the possibility of discovering
the laws of history lie and that as yet not a millionth part as much
mental effort has been applied in this direction by historians as has
been devoted to describing the actions of various kings commanders and
ministers and propounding the historians own reflections concerning
these actions





chapter ii

the forces of a dozen european nations burst into russia the russian
army and people avoided a collision till smolensk was reached and again
from smolensk to borodino the french army pushed on to moscow its
goal its impetus ever increasing as it neared its aim just as the
velocity of a falling body increases as it approaches the earth behind
it were seven hundred miles of hungerstricken hostile country ahead
were a few dozen miles separating it from its goal every soldier in
napoleons army felt this and the invasion moved on by its own momentum

the more the russian army retreated the more fiercely a spirit of hatred
of the enemy flared up and while it retreated the army increased and
consolidated at borodino a collision took place neither army was
broken up but the russian army retreated immediately after the
collision as inevitably as a ball recoils after colliding with another
having a greater momentum and with equal inevitability the ball of
invasion that had advanced with such momentum rolled on for some
distance though the collision had deprived it of all its force

the russians retreated eighty milesto beyond moscowand the french
reached moscow and there came to a standstill for five weeks after that
there was not a single battle the french did not move as a bleeding
mortally wounded animal licks its wounds they remained inert in moscow
for five weeks and then suddenly with no fresh reason fled back they
made a dash for the kaluga road and after a victoryfor at malo
yaroslavets the field of conflict again remained theirs without
undertaking a single serious battle they fled still more rapidly back
to smolensk beyond smolensk beyond the berezina beyond vilna and
farther still

on the evening of the twentysixth of august kutúzov and the whole
russian army were convinced that the battle of borodino was a victory
kutúzov reported so to the emperor he gave orders to prepare for a
fresh conflict to finish the enemy and did this not to deceive anyone
but because he knew that the enemy was beaten as everyone who had taken
part in the battle knew it

but all that evening and next day reports came in one after another of
unheardof losses of the loss of half the army and a fresh battle
proved physically impossible

it was impossible to give battle before information had been collected
the wounded gathered in the supplies of ammunition replenished the
slain reckoned up new officers appointed to replace those who had been
killed and before the men had had food and sleep and meanwhile the
very next morning after the battle the french army advanced of itself
upon the russians carried forward by the force of its own momentum now
seemingly increased in inverse proportion to the square of the distance
from its aim kutúzovs wish was to attack next day and the whole army
desired to do so but to make an attack the wish to do so is not
sufficient there must also be a possibility of doing it and that
possibility did not exist it was impossible not to retreat a days
march and then in the same way it was impossible not to retreat another
and a third days march and at last on the first of september when the
army drew near moscowdespite the strength of the feeling that had
arisen in all ranksthe force of circumstances compelled it to retire
beyond moscow and the troops retired one more last days march and
abandoned moscow to the enemy

for people accustomed to think that plans of campaign and battles are
made by generalsas anyone of us sitting over a map in his study may
imagine how he would have arranged things in this or that battlethe
questions present themselves why did kutúzov during the retreat not do
this or that why did he not take up a position before reaching fili
why did he not retire at once by the kaluga road abandoning moscow and
so on people accustomed to think in that way forget or do not know
the inevitable conditions which always limit the activities of any
commander in chief the activity of a commanderinchief does not at all
resemble the activity we imagine to ourselves when we sit at ease in our
studies examining some campaign on the map with a certain number of
troops on this and that side in a certain known locality and begin our
plans from some given moment a commanderinchief is never dealing with
the beginning of any eventthe position from which we always contemplate
it the commanderinchief is always in the midst of a series of
shifting events and so he never can at any moment consider the whole
import of an event that is occurring moment by moment the event is
imperceptibly shaping itself and at every moment of this continuous
uninterrupted shaping of events the commanderinchief is in the midst
of a most complex play of intrigues worries contingencies
authorities projects counsels threats and deceptions and is
continually obliged to reply to innumerable questions addressed to him
which constantly conflict with one another

learned military authorities quite seriously tell us that kutúzov should
have moved his army to the kaluga road long before reaching fili and
that somebody actually submitted such a proposal to him but a commander
in chief especially at a difficult moment has always before him not
one proposal but dozens simultaneously and all these proposals based
on strategics and tactics contradict each other

a commanderinchiefs business it would seem is simply to choose one
of these projects but even that he cannot do events and time do not
wait for instance on the twentyeighth it is suggested to him to cross
to the kaluga road but just then an adjutant gallops up from
miloradovich asking whether he is to engage the french or retire an
order must be given him at once that instant and the order to retreat
carries us past the turn to the kaluga road and after the adjutant
comes the commissary general asking where the stores are to be taken
and the chief of the hospitals asks where the wounded are to go and a
courier from petersburg brings a letter from the sovereign which does
not admit of the possibility of abandoning moscow and the commanderin
chiefs rival the man who is undermining him and there are always not
merely one but several such presents a new project diametrically
opposed to that of turning to the kaluga road and the commanderin
chief himself needs sleep and refreshment to maintain his energy and a
respectable general who has been overlooked in the distribution of
rewards comes to complain and the inhabitants of the district pray to
be defended and an officer sent to inspect the locality comes in and
gives a report quite contrary to what was said by the officer previously
sent and a spy a prisoner and a general who has been on
reconnaissance all describe the position of the enemys army
differently people accustomed to misunderstand or to forget these
inevitable conditions of a commanderinchiefs actions describe to us
for instance the position of the army at fili and assume that the
commanderinchief could on the first of september quite freely decide
whether to abandon moscow or defend it whereas with the russian army
less than four miles from moscow no such question existed when had
that question been settled at drissa and at smolensk and most palpably
of all on the twentyfourth of august at shevardino and on the twenty
sixth at borodino and each day and hour and minute of the retreat from
borodino to fili





chapter iii

when ermolov having been sent by kutúzov to inspect the position told
the field marshal that it was impossible to fight there before moscow
and that they must retreat kutúzov looked at him in silence

give me your hand said he and turning it over so as to feel the
pulse added you are not well my dear fellow think what you are
saying

kutúzov could not yet admit the possibility of retreating beyond moscow
without a battle

on the poklonny hill four miles from the dorogomilov gate of moscow
kutúzov got out of his carriage and sat down on a bench by the roadside
a great crowd of generals gathered round him and count rostopchin who
had come out from moscow joined them this brilliant company separated
into several groups who all discussed the advantages and disadvantages
of the position the state of the army the plans suggested the
situation of moscow and military questions generally though they had
not been summoned for the purpose and though it was not so called they
all felt that this was really a council of war the conversations all
dealt with public questions if anyone gave or asked for personal news
it was done in a whisper and they immediately reverted to general
matters no jokes or laughter or smiles even were seen among all
these men they evidently all made an effort to hold themselves at the
height the situation demanded and all these groups while talking among
themselves tried to keep near the commanderinchief whose bench
formed the center of the gathering and to speak so that he might
overhear them the commander in chief listened to what was being said
and sometimes asked them to repeat their remarks but did not himself
take part in the conversations or express any opinion after hearing
what was being said by one or other of these groups he generally turned
away with an air of disappointment as though they were not speaking of
anything he wished to hear some discussed the position that had been
chosen criticizing not the position itself so much as the mental
capacity of those who had chosen it others argued that a mistake had
been made earlier and that a battle should have been fought two days
before others again spoke of the battle of salamanca which was
described by crosart a newly arrived frenchman in a spanish uniform
this frenchman and one of the german princes serving with the russian
army were discussing the siege of saragossa and considering the
possibility of defending moscow in a similar manner count rostopchin
was telling a fourth group that he was prepared to die with the city
train bands under the walls of the capital but that he still could not
help regretting having been left in ignorance of what was happening and
that had he known it sooner things would have been different a fifth
group displaying the profundity of their strategic perceptions
discussed the direction the troops would now have to take a sixth group
was talking absolute nonsense kutúzovs expression grew more and more
preoccupied and gloomy from all this talk he saw only one thing that
to defend moscow was a physical impossibility in the full meaning of
those words that is to say so utterly impossible that if any senseless
commander were to give orders to fight confusion would result but the
battle would still not take place it would not take place because the
commanders not merely all recognized the position to be impossible but
in their conversations were only discussing what would happen after its
inevitable abandonment how could the commanders lead their troops to a
field of battle they considered impossible to hold the lowergrade
officers and even the soldiers who too reason also considered the
position impossible and therefore could not go to fight fully convinced
as they were of defeat if bennigsen insisted on the position being
defended and others still discussed it the question was no longer
important in itself but only as a pretext for disputes and intrigue
this kutúzov knew well

bennigsen who had chosen the position warmly displayed his russian
patriotism kutúzov could not listen to this without wincing by
insisting that moscow must be defended his aim was as clear as daylight
to kutúzov if the defense failed to throw the blame on kutúzov who had
brought the army as far as the sparrow hills without giving battle if
it succeeded to claim the success as his own or if battle were not
given to clear himself of the crime of abandoning moscow but this
intrigue did not now occupy the old mans mind one terrible question
absorbed him and to that question he heard no reply from anyone the
question for him now was have i really allowed napoleon to reach
moscow and when did i do so when was it decided can it have been
yesterday when i ordered platov to retreat or was it the evening
before when i had a nap and told bennigsen to issue orders or was it
earlier still when when was this terrible affair decided moscow
must be abandoned the army must retreat and the order to do so must be
given to give that terrible order seemed to him equivalent to
resigning the command of the army and not only did he love power to
which he was accustomed the honours awarded to prince prozorovski
under whom he had served in turkey galled him but he was convinced
that he was destined to save russia and that that was why against the
emperors wish and by the will of the people he had been chosen
commanderinchief he was convinced that he alone could maintain
command of the army in these difficult circumstances and that in all
the world he alone could encounter the invincible napoleon without fear
and he was horrified at the thought of the order he had to issue but
something had to be decided and these conversations around him which
were assuming too free a character must be stopped

he called the most important generals to him

my head be it good or bad must depend on itself said he rising
from the bench and he rode to fili where his carriages were waiting





chapter iv

the council of war began to assemble at two in the afternoon in the
better and roomier part of andrew savostyanovs hut the men women and
children of the large peasant family crowded into the back room across
the passage only malasha andrews sixyearold granddaughter whom his
serene highness had petted and to whom he had given a lump of sugar
while drinking his tea remained on the top of the brick oven in the
larger room malasha looked down from the oven with shy delight at the
faces uniforms and decorations of the generals who one after another
came into the room and sat down on the broad benches in the corner under
the icons granddad himself as malasha in her own mind called
kutúzov sat apart in a dark corner behind the oven he sat sunk deep
in a folding armchair and continually cleared his throat and pulled at
the collar of his coat which though it was unbuttoned still seemed to
pinch his neck those who entered went up one by one to the field
marshal he pressed the hands of some and nodded to others his adjutant
kaysarov was about to draw back the curtain of the window facing
kutúzov but the latter moved his hand angrily and kaysarov understood
that his serene highness did not wish his face to be seen

round the peasants deal table on which lay maps plans pencils and
papers so many people gathered that the orderlies brought in another
bench and put it beside the table ermolov kaysarov and toll who had
just arrived sat down on this bench in the foremost place immediately
under the icons sat barclay de tolly his high forehead merging into
his bald crown he had a st georges cross round his neck and looked
pale and ill he had been feverish for two days and was now shivering
and in pain beside him sat uvarov who with rapid gesticulations was
giving him some information speaking in low tones as they all did
chubby little dokhturov was listening attentively with eyebrows raised
and arms folded on his stomach on the other side sat count ostermann
tolstóy seemingly absorbed in his own thoughts his broad head with its
bold features and glittering eyes was resting on his hand raevski
twitching forward the black hair on his temples as was his habit
glanced now at kutúzov and now at the door with a look of impatience
konovnitsyns firm handsome and kindly face was lit up by a tender
sly smile his glance met malashas and the expression of his eyes
caused the little girl to smile

they were all waiting for bennigsen who on the pretext of inspecting
the position was finishing his savory dinner they waited for him from
four till six oclock and did not begin their deliberations all that
time but talked in low tones of other matters

only when bennigsen had entered the hut did kutúzov leave his corner and
draw toward the table but not near enough for the candles that had been
placed there to light up his face

bennigsen opened the council with the question are we to abandon
russias ancient and sacred capital without a struggle or are we to
defend it a prolonged and general silence followed there was a frown
on every face and only kutúzovs angry grunts and occasional cough broke
the silence all eyes were gazing at him malasha too looked at
granddad she was nearest to him and saw how his face puckered he
seemed about to cry but this did not last long

russias ancient and sacred capital he suddenly said repeating
bennigsens words in an angry voice and thereby drawing attention to the
false note in them allow me to tell you your excellency that that
question has no meaning for a russian he lurched his heavy body
forward such a question cannot be put it is senseless the question
i have asked these gentlemen to meet to discuss is a military one the
question is that of saving russia is it better to give up moscow
without a battle or by accepting battle to risk losing the army as well
as moscow that is the question on which i want your opinion and he
sank back in his chair

the discussion began bennigsen did not yet consider his game lost
admitting the view of barclay and others that a defensive battle at fili
was impossible but imbued with russian patriotism and the love of
moscow he proposed to move troops from the right to the left flank
during the night and attack the french right flank the following day
opinions were divided and arguments were advanced for and against that
project ermolov dokhturov and raevski agreed with bennigsen whether
feeling it necessary to make a sacrifice before abandoning the capital
or guided by other personal considerations these generals seemed not
to understand that this council could not alter the inevitable course of
events and that moscow was in effect already abandoned the other
generals however understood it and leaving aside the question of
moscow spoke of the direction the army should take in its retreat
malasha who kept her eyes fixed on what was going on before her
understood the meaning of the council differently it seemed to her that
it was only a personal struggle between granddad and longcoat as
she termed bennigsen she saw that they grew spiteful when they spoke to
one another and in her heart she sided with granddad in the midst of
the conversation she noticed granddad give bennigsen a quick subtle
glance and then to her joys she saw that granddad said something to
longcoat which settled him bennigsen suddenly reddened and paced
angrily up and down the room what so affected him was kutúzovs calm
and quiet comment on the advantage or disadvantage of bennigsens
proposal to move troops by night from the right to the left flank to
attack the french right wing

gentlemen said kutúzov i cannot approve of the counts plan moving
troops in close proximity to an enemy is always dangerous and military
history supports that view for instance kutúzov seemed to reflect
searching for an example then with a clear naïve look at bennigsen he
added oh yes take the battle of friedland which i think the count
well remembers and which was not fully successful only because our
troops were rearranged too near the enemy

there followed a momentary pause which seemed very long to them all

the discussion recommenced but pauses frequently occurred and they all
felt that there was no more to be said

during one of these pauses kutúzov heaved a deep sigh as if preparing to
speak they all looked at him

well gentlemen i see that it is i who will have to pay for the broken
crockery said he and rising slowly he moved to the table gentlemen
i have heard your views some of you will not agree with me but i he
paused by the authority entrusted to me by my sovereign and country
order a retreat

after that the generals began to disperse with the solemnity and
circumspect silence of people who are leaving after a funeral

some of the generals in low tones and in a strain very different from
the way they had spoken during the council communicated something to
their commanderinchief

malasha who had long been expected for supper climbed carefully
backwards down from the oven her bare little feet catching at its
projections and slipping between the legs of the generals she darted
out of the room

when he had dismissed the generals kutúzov sat a long time with his
elbows on the table thinking always of the same terrible question
when when did the abandonment of moscow become inevitable when was
that done which settled the matter and who was to blame for it

i did not expect this said he to his adjutant schneider when the
latter came in late that night i did not expect this i did not think
this would happen

you should take some rest your serene highness replied schneider

but no they shall eat horseflesh yet like the turks exclaimed
kutúzov without replying striking the table with his podgy fist they
shall too if only





chapter v

at that very time in circumstances even more important than retreating
without a battle namely the evacuation and burning of moscow
rostopchin who is usually represented as being the instigator of that
event acted in an altogether different manner from kutúzov

after the battle of borodino the abandonment and burning of moscow was
as inevitable as the retreat of the army beyond moscow without fighting

every russian might have predicted it not by reasoning but by the
feeling implanted in each of us and in our fathers

the same thing that took place in moscow had happened in all the towns
and villages on russian soil beginning with smolensk without the
participation of count rostopchin and his broadsheets the people
awaited the enemy unconcernedly did not riot or become excited or tear
anyone to pieces but faced its fate feeling within it the strength to
find what it should do at that most difficult moment and as soon as the
enemy drew near the wealthy classes went away abandoning their property
while the poorer remained and burned and destroyed what was left

the consciousness that this would be so and would always be so was and
is present in the heart of every russian and a consciousness of this
and a foreboding that moscow would be taken was present in russian
moscow society in  those who had quitted moscow already in july and
at the beginning of august showed that they expected this those who
went away taking what they could and abandoning their houses and half
their belongings did so from the latent patriotism which expresses
itself not by phrases or by giving ones children to save the fatherland
and similar unnatural exploits but unobtrusively simply organically
and therefore in the way that always produces the most powerful results

it is disgraceful to run away from danger only cowards are running
away from moscow they were told in his broadsheets rostopchin
impressed on them that to leave moscow was shameful they were ashamed
to be called cowards ashamed to leave but still they left knowing it
had to be done why did they go it is impossible to suppose that
rostopchin had scared them by his accounts of horrors napoleon had
committed in conquered countries the first people to go away were the
rich educated people who knew quite well that vienna and berlin had
remained intact and that during napoleons occupation the inhabitants
had spent their time pleasantly in the company of the charming frenchmen
whom the russians and especially the russian ladies then liked so
much

they went away because for russians there could be no question as to
whether things would go well or ill under french rule in moscow it was
out of the question to be under french rule it would be the worst thing
that could happen they went away even before the battle of borodino and
still more rapidly after it despite rostopchins calls to defend moscow
or the announcement of his intention to take the wonderworking icon of
the iberian mother of god and go to fight or of the balloons that were
to destroy the french and despite all the nonsense rostopchin wrote in
his broadsheets they knew that it was for the army to fight and that
if it could not succeed it would not do to take young ladies and house
serfs to the three hills quarter of moscow to fight napoleon and that
they must go away sorry as they were to abandon their property to
destruction they went away without thinking of the tremendous
significance of that immense and wealthy city being given over to
destruction for a great city with wooden buildings was certain when
abandoned by its inhabitants to be burned they went away each on his
own account and yet it was only in consequence of their going away that
the momentous event was accomplished that will always remain the
greatest glory of the russian people the lady who afraid of being
stopped by count rostopchins orders had already in june moved with her
negroes and her women jesters from moscow to her saratov estate with a
vague consciousness that she was not bonapartes servant was really
simply and truly carrying out the great work which saved russia but
count rostopchin who now taunted those who left moscow and now had the
government offices removed now distributed quite useless weapons to the
drunken rabble now had processions displaying the icons and now
forbade father augustin to remove icons or the relics of saints now
seized all the private carts in moscow and on one hundred and thirtysix
of them removed the balloon that was being constructed by leppich now
hinted that he would burn moscow and related how he had set fire to his
own house now wrote a proclamation to the french solemnly upbraiding
them for having destroyed his orphanage now claimed the glory of having
hinted that he would burn moscow and now repudiated the deed now
ordered the people to catch all spies and bring them to him and now
reproached them for doing so now expelled all the french residents from
moscow and now allowed madame aubertchalme the center of the whole
french colony in moscow to remain but ordered the venerable old
postmaster klyucharev to be arrested and exiled for no particular
offense now assembled the people at the three hills to fight the french
and now to get rid of them handed over to them a man to be killed and
himself drove away by a back gate now declared that he would not
survive the fall of moscow and now wrote french verses in albums
concerning his share in the affairthis man did not understand the
meaning of what was happening but merely wanted to do something himself
that would astonish people to perform some patriotically heroic feat
and like a child he made sport of the momentous and unavoidable
eventthe abandonment and burning of moscowand tried with his puny hand
now to speed and now to stay the enormous popular tide that bore him
along with it





chapter vi

hélène having returned with the court from vilna to petersburg found
herself in a difficult position

in petersburg she had enjoyed the special protection of a grandee who
occupied one of the highest posts in the empire in vilna she had formed
an intimacy with a young foreign prince when she returned to petersburg
both the magnate and the prince were there and both claimed their
rights hélène was faced by a new problemhow to preserve her intimacy
with both without offending either

what would have seemed difficult or even impossible to another woman did
not cause the least embarrassment to countess bezúkhova who evidently
deserved her reputation of being a very clever woman had she attempted
concealment or tried to extricate herself from her awkward position by
cunning she would have spoiled her case by acknowledging herself
guilty but hélène like a really great man who can do whatever he
pleases at once assumed her own position to be correct as she
sincerely believed it to be and that everyone else was to blame

the first time the young foreigner allowed himself to reproach her she
lifted her beautiful head and half turning to him said firmly thats
just like a manselfish and cruel i expected nothing else a woman
sacrifices herself for you she suffers and this is her reward what
right have you monseigneur to demand an account of my attachments and
friendships he is a man who has been more than a father to me the
prince was about to say something but hélène interrupted him

well yes said she it may be that he has other sentiments for me
than those of a father but that is not a reason for me to shut my door
on him i am not a man that i should repay kindness with ingratitude
know monseigneur that in all that relates to my intimate feelings i
render account only to god and to my conscience she concluded laying
her hand on her beautiful fully expanded bosom and looking up to
heaven

but for heavens sake listen to me

marry me and i will be your slave

but thats impossible

you wont deign to demean yourself by marrying me you said hélène
beginning to cry

the prince tried to comfort her but hélène as if quite distraught
said through her tears that there was nothing to prevent her marrying
that there were precedents there were up to that time very few but she
mentioned napoleon and some other exalted personages that she had
never been her husbands wife and that she had been sacrificed

but the law religion said the prince already yielding

the law religion what have they been invented for if they cant
arrange that said hélène

the prince was surprised that so simple an idea had not occurred to him
and he applied for advice to the holy brethren of the society of jesus
with whom he was on intimate terms

a few days later at one of those enchanting fetes which hélène gave at
her country house on the stone island the charming monsieur de jobert
a man no longer young with snow white hair and brilliant black eyes a
jesuit a robe courte  was presented to her and in the garden by the
light of the illuminations and to the sound of music talked to her for a
long time of the love of god of christ of the sacred heart and of the
consolations the one true catholic religion affords in this world and
the next hélène was touched and more than once tears rose to her eyes
and to those of monsieur de jobert and their voices trembled a dance
for which her partner came to seek her put an end to her discourse with
her future directeur de conscience but the next evening monsieur de
jobert came to see hélène when she was alone and after that often came
again

 lay member of the society of jesus

one day he took the countess to a roman catholic church where she knelt
down before the altar to which she was led the enchanting middleaged
frenchman laid his hands on her head and as she herself afterward
described it she felt something like a fresh breeze wafted into her
soul it was explained to her that this was la grace

after that a longfrocked abbé was brought to her she confessed to him
and he absolved her from her sins next day she received a box
containing the sacred host which was left at her house for her to
partake of a few days later hélène learned with pleasure that she had
now been admitted to the true catholic church and that in a few days the
pope himself would hear of her and would send her a certain document

all that was done around her and to her at this time all the attention
devoted to her by so many clever men and expressed in such pleasant
refined ways and the state of dovelike purity she was now in she wore
only white dresses and white ribbons all that time gave her pleasure
but her pleasure did not cause her for a moment to forget her aim and
as it always happens in contests of cunning that a stupid person gets
the better of cleverer ones hélènehaving realized that the main object
of all these words and all this trouble was after converting her to
catholicism to obtain money from her for jesuit institutions as to
which she received indicationsbefore parting with her money insisted
that the various operations necessary to free her from her husband
should be performed in her view the aim of every religion was merely to
preserve certain proprieties while affording satisfaction to human
desires and with this aim in one of her talks with her father
confessor she insisted on an answer to the question in how far was she
bound by her marriage

they were sitting in the twilight by a window in the drawing room the
scent of flowers came in at the window hélène was wearing a white
dress transparent over her shoulders and bosom the abbé a wellfed
man with a plump cleanshaven chin a pleasant firm mouth and white
hands meekly folded on his knees sat close to hélène and with a subtle
smile on his lips and a peaceful look of delight at her beauty
occasionally glanced at her face as he explained his opinion on the
subject hélène with an uneasy smile looked at his curly hair and his
plump cleanshaven blackish cheeks and every moment expected the
conversation to take a fresh turn but the abbé though he evidently
enjoyed the beauty of his companion was absorbed in his mastery of the
matter

the course of the father confessors arguments ran as follows ignorant
of the import of what you were undertaking you made a vow of conjugal
fidelity to a man who on his part by entering the married state without
faith in the religious significance of marriage committed an act of
sacrilege that marriage lacked the dual significance it should have
had yet in spite of this your vow was binding you swerved from it
what did you commit by so acting a venial or a mortal sin a venial
sin for you acted without evil intention if now you married again with
the object of bearing children your sin might be forgiven but the
question is again a twofold one firstly

but suddenly hélène who was getting bored said with one of her
bewitching smiles but i think that having espoused the true religion i
cannot be bound by what a false religion laid upon me

the director of her conscience was astounded at having the case
presented to him thus with the simplicity of columbus egg he was
delighted at the unexpected rapidity of his pupils progress but could
not abandon the edifice of argument he had laboriously constructed

let us understand one another countess said he with a smile and
began refuting his spiritual daughters arguments





chapter vii

hélène understood that the question was very simple and easy from the
ecclesiastical point of view and that her directors were making
difficulties only because they were apprehensive as to how the matter
would be regarded by the secular authorities

so she decided that it was necessary to prepare the opinion of society
she provoked the jealousy of the elderly magnate and told him what she
had told her other suitor that is she put the matter so that the only
way for him to obtain a right over her was to marry her the elderly
magnate was at first as much taken aback by this suggestion of marriage
with a woman whose husband was alive as the younger man had been but
hélènes imperturbable conviction that it was as simple and natural as
marrying a maiden had its effect on him too had hélène herself shown
the least sign of hesitation shame or secrecy her cause would
certainly have been lost but not only did she show no signs of secrecy
or shame on the contrary with goodnatured naïvete she told her
intimate friends and these were all petersburg that both the prince
and the magnate had proposed to her and that she loved both and was
afraid of grieving either

a rumor immediately spread in petersburg not that hélène wanted to be
divorced from her husband had such a report spread many would have
opposed so illegal an intention but simply that the unfortunate and
interesting hélène was in doubt which of the two men she should marry
the question was no longer whether this was possible but only which was
the better match and how the matter would be regarded at court there
were it is true some rigid individuals unable to rise to the height of
such a question who saw in the project a desecration of the sacrament
of marriage but there were not many such and they remained silent
while the majority were interested in hélènes good fortune and in the
question which match would be the more advantageous whether it was
right or wrong to remarry while one had a husband living they did not
discuss for that question had evidently been settled by people wiser
than you or me as they said and to doubt the correctness of that
decision would be to risk exposing ones stupidity and incapacity to
live in society

only márya dmítrievna akhrosímova who had come to petersburg that
summer to see one of her sons allowed herself plainly to express an
opinion contrary to the general one meeting hélène at a ball she
stopped her in the middle of the room and amid general silence said in
her gruff voice so wives of living men have started marrying again
perhaps you think you have invented a novelty you have been
forestalled my dear it was thought of long ago it is done in all the
brothels and with these words márya dmítrievna turning up her wide
sleeves with her usual threatening gesture and glancing sternly round
moved across the room

though people were afraid of márya dmítrievna she was regarded in
petersburg as a buffoon and so of what she had said they only noticed
and repeated in a whisper the one coarse word she had used supposing
the whole sting of her remark to lie in that word

prince vasíli who of late very often forgot what he had said and
repeated one and the same thing a hundred times remarked to his
daughter whenever he chanced to see her

hélène i have a word to say to you and he would lead her aside
drawing her hand downward i have heard of certain projects
concerning you know well my dear child you know how your fathers
heart rejoices to know that you you have suffered so much but my
dear child consult only your own heart that is all i have to say and
concealing his unvarying emotion he would press his cheek against his
daughters and move away

bilibin who had not lost his reputation of an exceedingly clever man
and who was one of the disinterested friends so brilliant a woman as
hélène always hasmen friends who can never change into loversonce gave
her his view of the matter at a small and intimate gathering

listen bilibin said hélène she always called friends of that sort
by their surnames and she touched his coat sleeve with her white
beringed fingers tell me as you would a sister what i ought to do
which of the two

bilibin wrinkled up the skin over his eyebrows and pondered with a
smile on his lips

you are not taking me unawares you know said he as a true friend
i have thought and thought again about your affair you see if you
marry the princehe meant the younger manand he crooked one finger
you forever lose the chance of marrying the other and you will
displease the court besides you know there is some kind of
connection but if you marry the old count you will make his last days
happy and as widow of the grand the prince would no longer be making
a mesalliance by marrying you and bilibin smoothed out his forehead

thats a true friend said hélène beaming and again touching
bilibins sleeve but i love them you know and dont want to distress
either of them i would give my life for the happiness of them both

bilibin shrugged his shoulders as much as to say that not even he could
help in that difficulty

une maitressefemme  thats what is called putting things squarely
she would like to be married to all three at the same time thought he

 a masterly woman

but tell me how will your husband look at the matter bilibin asked
his reputation being so well established that he did not fear to ask so
naïve a question will he agree

oh he loves me so said hélène who for some reason imagined that
pierre too loved her he will do anything for me

bilibin puckered his skin in preparation for something witty

even divorce you said he

hélène laughed

among those who ventured to doubt the justifiability of the proposed
marriage was hélènes mother princess kurágina she was continually
tormented by jealousy of her daughter and now that jealousy concerned a
subject near to her own heart she could not reconcile herself to the
idea she consulted a russian priest as to the possibility of divorce
and remarriage during a husbands lifetime and the priest told her that
it was impossible and to her delight showed her a text in the gospel
which as it seemed to him plainly forbids remarriage while the husband
is alive

armed with these arguments which appeared to her unanswerable she
drove to her daughters early one morning so as to find her alone

having listened to her mothers objections hélène smiled blandly and
ironically

but it says plainly whosoever shall marry her that is divorced
said the old princess

ah maman ne dites pas de betises vous ne comprenez rien dans ma
position jai des devoirs  said hélène changing from russian in
which language she always felt that her case did not sound quite clear
into french which suited it better

 oh mamma dont talk nonsense you dont understand anything in my
position i have obligations

but my dear

oh mamma how is it you dont understand that the holy father who has
the right to grant dispensations

just then the lady companion who lived with hélène came in to announce
that his highness was in the ballroom and wished to see her

non diteslui que je ne veux pas le voir que je suis furieuse contre
lui parce quil ma manque parole

 no tell him i dont wish to see him i am furious with him for not
keeping his word to me

comtesse a tout peche misericorde  said a fairhaired young man
with a long face and nose as he entered the room

 countess there is mercy for every sin

the old princess rose respectfully and curtsied the young man who had
entered took no notice of her the princess nodded to her daughter and
sidled out of the room

yes she is right thought the old princess all her convictions
dissipated by the appearance of his highness she is right but how is
it that we in our irrecoverable youth did not know it yet it is so
simple she thought as she got into her carriage

by the beginning of august hélènes affairs were clearly defined and she
wrote a letter to her husbandwho as she imagined loved her very
muchinforming him of her intention to marry nn and of her having
embraced the one true faith and asking him to carry out all the
formalities necessary for a divorce which would be explained to him by
the bearer of the letter

and so i pray god to have you my friend in his holy and powerful
keepingyour friend hélène

this letter was brought to pierres house when he was on the field of
borodino





chapter viii

toward the end of the battle of borodino pierre having run down from
raevskis battery a second time made his way through a gully to
knyazkovo with a crowd of soldiers reached the dressing station and
seeing blood and hearing cries and groans hurried on still entangled in
the crowds of soldiers

the one thing he now desired with his whole soul was to get away quickly
from the terrible sensations amid which he had lived that day and return
to ordinary conditions of life and sleep quietly in a room in his own
bed he felt that only in the ordinary conditions of life would he be
able to understand himself and all he had seen and felt but such
ordinary conditions of life were nowhere to be found

though shells and bullets did not whistle over the road along which he
was going still on all sides there was what there had been on the field
of battle there were still the same suffering exhausted and sometimes
strangely indifferent faces the same blood the same soldiers
overcoats the same sounds of firing which though distant now still
aroused terror and besides this there were the foul air and the dust

having gone a couple of miles along the mozhaysk road pierre sat down
by the roadside

dusk had fallen and the roar of guns died away pierre lay leaning on
his elbow for a long time gazing at the shadows that moved past him in
the darkness he was continually imagining that a cannon ball was flying
toward him with a terrific whizz and then he shuddered and sat up he
had no idea how long he had been there in the middle of the night three
soldiers having brought some firewood settled down near him and began
lighting a fire

the soldiers who threw sidelong glances at pierre got the fire to burn
and placed an iron pot on it into which they broke some dried bread and
put a little dripping the pleasant odor of greasy viands mingled with
the smell of smoke pierre sat up and sighed the three soldiers were
eating and talking among themselves taking no notice of him

and who may you be one of them suddenly asked pierre evidently
meaning what pierre himself had in mind namely if you want to eat
well give you some food only let us know whether you are an honest
man

i i said pierre feeling it necessary to minimize his social
position as much as possible so as to be nearer to the soldiers and
better understood by them by rights i am a militia officer but my men
are not here i came to the battle and have lost them

there now said one of the soldiers

another shook his head

would you like a little mash the first soldier asked and handed
pierre a wooden spoon after licking it clean

pierre sat down by the fire and began eating the mash as they called
the food in the cauldron and he thought it more delicious than any food
he had ever tasted as he sat bending greedily over it helping himself
to large spoonfuls and chewing one after another his face was lit up by
the fire and the soldiers looked at him in silence

where have you to go to tell us said one of them

to mozhaysk

youre a gentleman arent you

yes

and whats your name

peter kirilych

well then peter kirilych come along with us well take you there

in the total darkness the soldiers walked with pierre to mozhaysk

by the time they got near mozhaysk and began ascending the steep hill
into the town the cocks were already crowing pierre went on with the
soldiers quite forgetting that his inn was at the bottom of the hill
and that he had already passed it he would not soon have remembered
this such was his state of forgetfulness had he not halfway up the
hill stumbled upon his groom who had been to look for him in the town
and was returning to the inn the groom recognized pierre in the
darkness by his white hat

your excellency he said why we were beginning to despair how is
it you are on foot and where are you going please

oh yes said pierre

the soldiers stopped

so youve found your folk said one of them well goodby peter
kirilychisnt it

goodbye peter kirilych pierre heard the other voices repeat

goodbye he said and turned with his groom toward the inn

i ought to give them something he thought and felt in his pocket
no better not said another inner voice

there was not a room to be had at the inn they were all occupied
pierre went out into the yard and covering himself up head and all lay
down in his carriage





chapter ix

scarcely had pierre laid his head on the pillow before he felt himself
falling asleep but suddenly almost with the distinctness of reality
he heard the boom boom boom of firing the thud of projectiles groans
and cries and smelled blood and powder and a feeling of horror and
dread of death seized him filled with fright he opened his eyes and
lifted his head from under his cloak all was tranquil in the yard only
someones orderly passed through the gateway splashing through the mud
and talked to the innkeeper above pierres head some pigeons disturbed
by the movement he had made in sitting up fluttered under the dark roof
of the penthouse the whole courtyard was permeated by a strong peaceful
smell of stable yards delightful to pierre at that moment he could see
the clear starry sky between the dark roofs of two penthouses

thank god there is no more of that he thought covering up his head
again oh what a terrible thing is fear and how shamefully i yielded
to it but they they were steady and calm all the time to the
end thought he

they in pierres mind were the soldiers those who had been at the
battery those who had given him food and those who had prayed before
the icon they those strange men he had not previously known stood out
clearly and sharply from everyone else

to be a soldier just a soldier thought pierre as he fell asleep to
enter communal life completely to be imbued by what makes them what
they are but how cast off all the superfluous devilish burden of my
outer man there was a time when i could have done it i could have run
away from my father as i wanted to or i might have been sent to serve
as a soldier after the duel with dólokhov and the memory of the dinner
at the english club when he had challenged dólokhov flashed through
pierres mind and then he remembered his benefactor at torzhok and now
a picture of a solemn meeting of the lodge presented itself to his mind
it was taking place at the english club and someone near and dear to him
sat at the end of the table yes that is he it is my benefactor but
he died thought pierre yes he died and i did not know he was
alive how sorry i am that he died and how glad i am that he is alive
again on one side of the table sat anatole dólokhov nesvitski
denisov and others like them in his dream the category to which these
men belonged was as clearly defined in his mind as the category of those
he termed they and he heard those people anatole and dólokhov
shouting and singing loudly yet through their shouting the voice of his
benefactor was heard speaking all the time and the sound of his words
was as weighty and uninterrupted as the booming on the battlefield but
pleasant and comforting pierre did not understand what his benefactor
was saying but he knew the categories of thoughts were also quite
distinct in his dream that he was talking of goodness and the
possibility of being what they were and they with their simple kind
firm faces surrounded his benefactor on all sides but though they were
kindly they did not look at pierre and did not know him wishing to
speak and to attract their attention he got up but at that moment his
legs grew cold and bare

he felt ashamed and with one arm covered his legs from which his cloak
had in fact slipped for a moment as he was rearranging his cloak pierre
opened his eyes and saw the same penthouse roofs posts and yard but
now they were all bluish lit up and glittering with frost or dew

it is dawn thought pierre but thats not what i want i want to
hear and understand my benefactors words again he covered himself up
with his cloak but now neither the lodge nor his benefactor was there
there were only thoughts clearly expressed in words thoughts that
someone was uttering or that he himself was formulating

afterwards when he recalled those thoughts pierre was convinced that
someone outside himself had spoken them though the impressions of that
day had evoked them he had never it seemed to him been able to think
and express his thoughts like that when awake

to endure war is the most difficult subordination of mans freedom to
the law of god the voice had said simplicity is submission to the
will of god you cannot escape from him and they are simple they do
not talk but act the spoken word is silver but the unspoken is golden
man can be master of nothing while he fears death but he who does not
fear it possesses all if there were no suffering man would not know
his limitations would not know himself the hardest thing pierre went
on thinking or hearing in his dream is to be able in your soul to
unite the meaning of all to unite all he asked himself no not to
unite thoughts cannot be united but to harness all these thoughts
together is what we need yes one must harness them must harness
them he repeated to himself with inward rapture feeling that these
words and they alone expressed what he wanted to say and solved the
question that tormented him

yes one must harness it is time to harness

time to harness time to harness your excellency your excellency
some voice was repeating we must harness it is time to harness

it was the voice of the groom trying to wake him the sun shone
straight into pierres face he glanced at the dirty innyard in the
middle of which soldiers were watering their lean horses at the pump
while carts were passing out of the gate pierre turned away with
repugnance and closing his eyes quickly fell back on the carriage seat
no i dont want that i dont want to see and understand that i want
to understand what was revealing itself to me in my dream one second
more and i should have understood it all but what am i to do harness
but how can i harness everything and pierre felt with horror that the
meaning of all he had seen and thought in the dream had been destroyed

the groom the coachman and the innkeeper told pierre that an officer
had come with news that the french were already near mozhaysk and that
our men were leaving it

pierre got up and having told them to harness and overtake him went on
foot through the town

the troops were moving on leaving about ten thousand wounded behind
them there were wounded in the yards at the windows of the houses and
the streets were crowded with them in the streets around carts that
were to take some of the wounded away shouts curses and blows could
be heard pierre offered the use of his carriage which had overtaken
him to a wounded general he knew and drove with him to moscow on the
way pierre was told of the death of his brotherinlaw anatole and of
that of prince andrew





chapter x

on the thirteenth of august pierre reached moscow close to the gates of
the city he was met by count rostopchins adjutant

we have been looking for you everywhere said the adjutant the count
wants to see you particularly he asks you to come to him at once on a
very important matter

without going home pierre took a cab and drove to see the moscow
commanderinchief

count rostopchin had only that morning returned to town from his summer
villa at sokolniki the anteroom and reception room of his house were
full of officials who had been summoned or had come for orders
vasilchikov and platov had already seen the count and explained to him
that it was impossible to defend moscow and that it would have to be
surrendered though this news was being concealed from the inhabitants
the officialsthe heads of the various government departmentsknew that
moscow would soon be in the enemys hands just as count rostopchin
himself knew it and to escape personal responsibility they had all come
to the governor to ask how they were to deal with their various
departments

as pierre was entering the reception room a courier from the army came
out of rostopchins private room

in answer to questions with which he was greeted the courier made a
despairing gesture with his hand and passed through the room

while waiting in the reception room pierre with weary eyes watched the
various officials old and young military and civilian who were there
they all seemed dissatisfied and uneasy pierre went up to a group of
men one of whom he knew after greeting pierre they continued their
conversation

if theyre sent out and brought back again later on it will do no harm
but as things are now one cant answer for anything

but you see what he writes said another pointing to a printed
sheet he held in his hand

thats another matter thats necessary for the people said the
first

what is it asked pierre

oh its a fresh broadsheet

pierre took it and began reading

his serene highness has passed through mozhaysk in order to join up with
the troops moving toward him and has taken up a strong position where
the enemy will not soon attack him forty eight guns with ammunition
have been sent him from here and his serene highness says he will
defend moscow to the last drop of blood and is even ready to fight in
the streets do not be upset brothers that the law courts are closed
things have to be put in order and we will deal with villains in our
own way when the time comes i shall want both town and peasant lads and
will raise the cry a day or two beforehand but they are not wanted yet
so i hold my peace an ax will be useful a hunting spear not bad but a
threepronged fork will be best of all a frenchman is no heavier than a
sheaf of rye tomorrow after dinner i shall take the iberian icon of the
mother of god to the wounded in the catherine hospital where we will
have some water blessed that will help them to get well quicker i
too am well now one of my eyes was sore but now i am on the lookout
with both

but military men have told me that it is impossible to fight in the
town said pierre and that the position

well of course thats what we were saying replied the first
speaker

and what does he mean by one of my eyes was sore but now i am on the
lookout with both asked pierre

the count had a sty replied the adjutant smiling and was very much
upset when i told him people had come to ask what was the matter with
him by the by count he added suddenly addressing pierre with a
smile we heard that you have family troubles and that the countess
your wife

i have heard nothing pierre replied unconcernedly but what have you
heard

oh well you know people often invent things i only say what i
heard

but what did you hear

well they say continued the adjutant with the same smile that the
countess your wife is preparing to go abroad i expect its
nonsense

possibly remarked pierre looking about him absentmindedly and who
is that he asked indicating a short old man in a clean blue peasant
overcoat with a big snowwhite beard and eyebrows and a ruddy face

he thats a tradesman that is to say hes the restaurant keeper
vereshchagin perhaps you have heard of that affair with the
proclamation

oh so that is vereshchagin said pierre looking at the firm calm
face of the old man and seeking any indication of his being a traitor

thats not he himself thats the father of the fellow who wrote the
proclamation said the adjutant the young man is in prison and i
expect it will go hard with him

an old gentleman wearing a star and another official a german wearing a
cross round his neck approached the speaker

its a complicated story you know said the adjutant that
proclamation appeared about two months ago the count was informed of
it he gave orders to investigate the matter gabriel ivánovich here
made the inquiries the proclamation had passed through exactly sixty
three hands he asked one from whom did you get it from soandso
he went to the next one from whom did you get it and so on till he
reached vereshchagin a half educated tradesman you know a pet of a
trader said the adjutant smiling they asked him who gave it you
and the point is that we knew whom he had it from he could only have
had it from the postmaster but evidently they had come to some
understanding he replied from no one i made it up myself they
threatened and questioned him but he stuck to that i made it up
myself and so it was reported to the count who sent for the man
from whom did you get the proclamation i wrote it myself well you
know the count said the adjutant cheerfully with a smile of pride
he flared up dreadfullyand just think of the fellows audacity lying
and obstinacy

and the count wanted him to say it was from klyucharev i understand
said pierre

not at all rejoined the adjutant in dismay klyucharev had his own
sins to answer for without that and that is why he has been banished
but the point is that the count was much annoyed how could you have
written it yourself said he and he took up the hamburg gazette that
was lying on the table here it is you did not write it yourself but
translated it and translated it abominably because you dont even know
french you fool and what do you think no said he i have not
read any papers i made it up myself if thats so youre a traitor
and ill have you tried and youll be hanged say from whom you had
it i have seen no papers i made it up myself and that was the end
of it the count had the father fetched but the fellow stuck to it he
was sent for trial and condemned to hard labor i believe now the
father has come to intercede for him but hes a goodfornothing lad
you know that sort of tradesmans son a dandy and ladykiller he
attended some lectures somewhere and imagines that the devil is no match
for him thats the sort of fellow he is his father keeps a cookshop
here by the stone bridge and you know there was a large icon of god
almighty painted with a scepter in one hand and an orb in the other
well he took that icon home with him for a few days and what did he do
he found some scoundrel of a painter





chapter xi

in the middle of this fresh tale pierre was summoned to the commander in
chief

when he entered the private room count rostopchin puckering his face
was rubbing his forehead and eyes with his hand a short man was saying
something but when pierre entered he stopped speaking and went out

ah how do you do great warrior said rostopchin as soon as the short
man had left the room we have heard of your prowess but thats not
the point between ourselves mon cher do you belong to the masons he
went on severely as though there were something wrong about it which he
nevertheless intended to pardon pierre remained silent i am well
informed my friend but i am aware that there are masons and i hope
that you are not one of those who on pretense of saving mankind wish to
ruin russia

yes i am a mason pierre replied

there you see mon cher i expect you know that messrs speranski and
magnitski have been deported to their proper place mr klyucharev has
been treated in the same way and so have others who on the plea of
building up the temple of solomon have tried to destroy the temple of
their fatherland you can understand that there are reasons for this and
that i could not have exiled the postmaster had he not been a harmful
person it has now come to my knowledge that you lent him your carriage
for his removal from town and that you have even accepted papers from
him for safe custody i like you and dont wish you any harm andas you
are only half my agei advise you as a father would to cease all
communication with men of that stamp and to leave here as soon as
possible

but what did klyucharev do wrong count asked pierre

that is for me to know but not for you to ask shouted rostopchin

if he is accused of circulating napoleons proclamation it is not
proved that he did so said pierre without looking at rostopchin and
vereshchagin

there we are rostopchin shouted at pierre louder than before
frowning suddenly vereshchagin is a renegade and a traitor who will be
punished as he deserves said he with the vindictive heat with which
people speak when recalling an insult but i did not summon you to
discuss my actions but to give you adviceor an order if you prefer it
i beg you to leave the town and break off all communication with such
men as klyucharev and i will knock the nonsense out of anybodybut
probably realizing that he was shouting at bezúkhov who so far was not
guilty of anything he added taking pierres hand in a friendly manner
we are on the eve of a public disaster and i havent time to be polite
to everybody who has business with me my head is sometimes in a whirl
well mon cher what are you doing personally

why nothing answered pierre without raising his eyes or changing the
thoughtful expression of his face

the count frowned

a word of friendly advice mon cher be off as soon as you can thats
all i have to tell you happy he who has ears to hear goodbye my dear
fellow oh by the by he shouted through the doorway after pierre is
it true that the countess has fallen into the clutches of the holy
fathers of the society of jesus

pierre did not answer and left rostopchins room more sullen and angry
than he had ever before shown himself

when he reached home it was already getting dark some eight people had
come to see him that evening the secretary of a committee the colonel
of his battalion his steward his majordomo and various petitioners
they all had business with pierre and wanted decisions from him pierre
did not understand and was not interested in any of these questions and
only answered them in order to get rid of these people when left alone
at last he opened and read his wifes letter

they the soldiers at the battery prince andrew killed that old
man simplicity is submission to god suffering is necessary the
meaning of all one must harness my wife is getting married one
must forget and understand and going to his bed he threw himself on
it without undressing and immediately fell asleep

when he awoke next morning the majordomo came to inform him that a
special messenger a police officer had come from count rostopchin to
know whether count bezúkhov had left or was leaving the town

a dozen persons who had business with pierre were awaiting him in the
drawing room pierre dressed hurriedly and instead of going to see
them went to the back porch and out through the gate

from that time till the end of the destruction of moscow no one of
bezúkhovs household despite all the search they made saw pierre again
or knew where he was





chapter xii

the rostóvs remained in moscow till the first of september that is
till the eve of the enemys entry into the city

after pétya had joined obolenskis regiment of cossacks and left for
belaya tserkov where that regiment was forming the countess was seized
with terror the thought that both her sons were at the war had both
gone from under her wing that today or tomorrow either or both of them
might be killed like the three sons of one of her acquaintances struck
her that summer for the first time with cruel clearness she tried to
get nicholas back and wished to go herself to join pétya or to get him
an appointment somewhere in petersburg but neither of these proved
possible pétya could not return unless his regiment did so or unless he
was transferred to another regiment on active service nicholas was
somewhere with the army and had not sent a word since his last letter
in which he had given a detailed account of his meeting with princess
mary the countess did not sleep at night or when she did fall asleep
dreamed that she saw her sons lying dead after many consultations and
conversations the count at last devised means to tranquillize her he
got pétya transferred from obolenskis regiment to bezúkhovs which was
in training near moscow though pétya would remain in the service this
transfer would give the countess the consolation of seeing at least one
of her sons under her wing and she hoped to arrange matters for her
pétya so as not to let him go again but always get him appointed to
places where he could not possibly take part in a battle as long as
nicholas alone was in danger the countess imagined that she loved her
firstborn more than all her other children and even reproached herself
for it but when her youngest the scapegrace who had been bad at
lessons was always breaking things in the house and making himself a
nuisance to everybody that snubnosed pétya with his merry black eyes
and fresh rosy cheeks where soft down was just beginning to showwhen he
was thrown amid those big dreadful cruel men who were fighting
somewhere about something and apparently finding pleasure in itthen his
mother thought she loved him more much more than all her other
children the nearer the time came for pétya to return the more uneasy
grew the countess she began to think she would never live to see such
happiness the presence of sónya of her beloved natásha or even of her
husband irritated her what do i want with them i want no one but
pétya she thought

at the end of august the rostóvs received another letter from nicholas
he wrote from the province of voronezh where he had been sent to procure
remounts but that letter did not set the countess at ease knowing that
one son was out of danger she became the more anxious about pétya

though by the twentieth of august nearly all the rostóvs acquaintances
had left moscow and though everybody tried to persuade the countess to
get away as quickly as possible she would not hear of leaving before
her treasure her adored pétya returned on the twentyeighth of august
he arrived the passionate tenderness with which his mother received him
did not please the sixteenyearold officer though she concealed from
him her intention of keeping him under her wing pétya guessed her
designs and instinctively fearing that he might give way to emotion
when with hermight become womanish as he termed it to himselfhe
treated her coldly avoided her and during his stay in moscow attached
himself exclusively to natásha for whom he had always had a particularly
brotherly tenderness almost loverlike

owing to the counts customary carelessness nothing was ready for their
departure by the twentyeighth of august and the carts that were to come
from their ryazan and moscow estates to remove their household
belongings did not arrive till the thirtieth

from the twentyeighth till the thirtyfirst all moscow was in a bustle
and commotion every day thousands of men wounded at borodino were
brought in by the dorogomilov gate and taken to various parts of moscow
and thousands of carts conveyed the inhabitants and their possessions
out by the other gates in spite of rostopchins broadsheets or because
of them or independently of them the strangest and most contradictory
rumors were current in the town some said that no one was to be allowed
to leave the city others on the contrary said that all the icons had
been taken out of the churches and everybody was to be ordered to leave
some said there had been another battle after borodino at which the
french had been routed while others on the contrary reported that the
russian army had been destroyed some talked about the moscow militia
which preceded by the clergy would go to the three hills others
whispered that augustin had been forbidden to leave that traitors had
been seized that the peasants were rioting and robbing people on their
way from moscow and so on but all this was only talk in reality
though the council of fili at which it was decided to abandon moscow
had not yet been held both those who went away and those who remained
behind felt though they did not show it that moscow would certainly be
abandoned and that they ought to get away as quickly as possible and
save their belongings it was felt that everything would suddenly break
up and change but up to the first of september nothing had done so as
a criminal who is being led to execution knows that he must die
immediately but yet looks about him and straightens the cap that is
awry on his head so moscow involuntarily continued its wonted life
though it knew that the time of its destruction was near when the
conditions of life to which its people were accustomed to submit would
be completely upset

during the three days preceding the occupation of moscow the whole
rostóv family was absorbed in various activities the head of the
family count ilyá rostóv continually drove about the city collecting
the current rumors from all sides and gave superficial and hasty orders
at home about the preparations for their departure

the countess watched the things being packed was dissatisfied with
everything was constantly in pursuit of pétya who was always running
away from her and was jealous of natásha with whom he spent all his
time sónya alone directed the practical side of matters by getting
things packed but of late sónya had been particularly sad and silent
nicholas letter in which he mentioned princess mary had elicited in
her presence joyous comments from the countess who saw an intervention
of providence in this meeting of the princess and nicholas

i was never pleased at bolkónskis engagement to natásha said the
countess but i always wanted nicholas to marry the princess and had a
presentiment that it would happen what a good thing it would be

sónya felt that this was true that the only possibility of retrieving
the rostóvs affairs was by nicholas marrying a rich woman and that the
princess was a good match it was very bitter for her but despite her
grief or perhaps just because of it she took on herself all the
difficult work of directing the storing and packing of their things and
was busy for whole days the count and countess turned to her when they
had any orders to give pétya and natásha on the contrary far from
helping their parents were generally a nuisance and a hindrance to
everyone almost all day long the house resounded with their running
feet their cries and their spontaneous laughter they laughed and were
gay not because there was any reason to laugh but because gaiety and
mirth were in their hearts and so everything that happened was a cause
for gaiety and laughter to them pétya was in high spirits because
having left home a boy he had returned as everybody told him a fine
young man because he was at home because he had left belaya tserkov
where there was no hope of soon taking part in a battle and had come to
moscow where there was to be fighting in a few days and chiefly because
natásha whose lead he always followed was in high spirits natásha was
gay because she had been sad too long and now nothing reminded her of
the cause of her sadness and because she was feeling well she was also
happy because she had someone to adore her the adoration of others was
a lubricant the wheels of her machine needed to make them run freelyand
pétya adored her above all they were gay because there was a war near
moscow there would be fighting at the town gates arms were being given
out everybody was escapinggoing away somewhere and in general
something extraordinary was happening and that is always exciting
especially to the young





chapter xiii

on saturday the thirtyfirst of august everything in the rostóvs
house seemed topsyturvy all the doors were open all the furniture was
being carried out or moved about and the mirrors and pictures had been
taken down there were trunks in the rooms and hay wrapping paper and
ropes were scattered about the peasants and house serfs carrying out
the things were treading heavily on the parquet floors the yard was
crowded with peasant carts some loaded high and already corded up
others still empty

the voices and footsteps of the many servants and of the peasants who
had come with the carts resounded as they shouted to one another in the
yard and in the house the count had been out since morning the
countess had a headache brought on by all the noise and turmoil and was
lying down in the new sitting room with a vinegar compress on her head
pétya was not at home he had gone to visit a friend with whom he meant
to obtain a transfer from the militia to the active army sónya was in
the ballroom looking after the packing of the glass and china natásha
was sitting on the floor of her dismantled room with dresses ribbons
and scarves strewn all about her gazing fixedly at the floor and
holding in her hands the old ball dress already out of fashion which
she had worn at her first petersburg ball

natásha was ashamed of doing nothing when everyone else was so busy and
several times that morning had tried to set to work but her heart was
not in it and she could not and did not know how to do anything except
with all her heart and all her might for a while she had stood beside
sónya while the china was being packed and tried to help but soon gave
it up and went to her room to pack her own things at first she found it
amusing to give away dresses and ribbons to the maids but when that was
done and what was left had still to be packed she found it dull

dunyasha you pack you will wont you dear and when dunyasha
willingly promised to do it all for her natásha sat down on the floor
took her old ball dress and fell into a reverie quite unrelated to what
ought to have occupied her thoughts now she was roused from her reverie
by the talk of the maids in the next room which was theirs and by the
sound of their hurried footsteps going to the back porch natásha got up
and looked out of the window an enormously long row of carts full of
wounded men had stopped in the street

the housekeeper the old nurse the cooks coachmen maids footmen
postilions and scullions stood at the gate staring at the wounded

natásha throwing a clean pocket handkerchief over her hair and holding
an end of it in each hand went out into the street

the former housekeeper old mavra kuzminichna had stepped out of the
crowd by the gate gone up to a cart with a hood constructed of bast
mats and was speaking to a pale young officer who lay inside natásha
moved a few steps forward and stopped shyly still holding her
handkerchief and listened to what the housekeeper was saying

then you have nobody in moscow she was saying you would be more
comfortable somewhere in a house in ours for instance the family
are leaving

i dont know if it would be allowed replied the officer in a weak
voice here is our commanding officer ask him and he pointed to a
stout major who was walking back along the street past the row of carts

natásha glanced with frightened eyes at the face of the wounded officer
and at once went to meet the major

may the wounded men stay in our house she asked

the major raised his hand to his cap with a smile

which one do you want maamselle said he screwing up his eyes and
smiling

natásha quietly repeated her question and her face and whole manner
were so serious though she was still holding the ends of her
handkerchief that the major ceased smiling and after some reflectionas
if considering in how far the thing was possiblereplied in the
affirmative

oh yes why not they may he said

with a slight inclination of her head natásha stepped back quickly to
mavra kuzminichna who stood talking compassionately to the officer

they may he says they may whispered natásha

the cart in which the officer lay was turned into the rostóvs yard and
dozens of carts with wounded men began at the invitation of the
townsfolk to turn into the yards and to draw up at the entrances of the
houses in povarskáya street natásha was evidently pleased to be dealing
with new people outside the ordinary routine of her life she and mavra
kuzminichna tried to get as many of the wounded as possible into their
yard

your papa must be told though said mavra kuzminichna

never mind never mind what does it matter for one day we can move
into the drawing room they can have all our half of the house

there now young lady you do take things into your head even if we
put them into the wing the mens room or the nurses room we must ask
permission

well ill ask

natásha ran into the house and went on tiptoe through the halfopen door
into the sitting room where there was a smell of vinegar and hoffmans
drops

are you asleep mamma

oh what sleep said the countess waking up just as she was dropping
into a doze

mamma darling said natásha kneeling by her mother and bringing her
face close to her mothers i am sorry forgive me ill never do it
again i woke you up mavra kuzminichna has sent me they have brought
some wounded hereofficers will you let them come they have nowhere to
go i knew youd let them come she said quickly all in one breath

what officers whom have they brought i dont understand anything
about it said the countess

natásha laughed and the countess too smiled slightly

i knew youd give permission so ill tell them and having kissed
her mother natásha got up and went to the door

in the hall she met her father who had returned with bad news

weve stayed too long said the count with involuntary vexation the
club is closed and the police are leaving

papa is it all rightive invited some of the wounded into the house
said natásha

of course it is he answered absently thats not the point i beg
you not to indulge in trifles now but to help to pack and tomorrow we
must go go go

and the count gave a similar order to the majordomo and the servants

at dinner pétya having returned home told them the news he had heard he
said the people had been getting arms in the kremlin and that though
rostopchins broadsheet had said that he would sound a call two or three
days in advance the order had certainly already been given for everyone
to go armed to the three hills tomorrow and that there would be a big
battle there

the countess looked with timid horror at her sons eager excited face
as he said this she realized that if she said a word about his not
going to the battle she knew he enjoyed the thought of the impending
engagement he would say something about men honor and the
fatherlandsomething senseless masculine and obstinate which there
would be no contradicting and her plans would be spoiled and so
hoping to arrange to leave before then and take pétya with her as their
protector and defender she did not answer him but after dinner called
the count aside and implored him with tears to take her away quickly
that very night if possible with a womans involuntary loving cunning
she who till then had not shown any alarm said that she would die of
fright if they did not leave that very night without any pretense she
was now afraid of everything





chapter xiv

madame schoss who had been out to visit her daughter increased the
countess fears still more by telling what she had seen at a spirit
dealers in myasnitski street when returning by that street she had
been unable to pass because of a drunken crowd rioting in front of the
shop she had taken a cab and driven home by a side street and the
cabman had told her that the people were breaking open the barrels at
the drink store having received orders to do so

after dinner the whole rostóv household set to work with enthusiastic
haste packing their belongings and preparing for their departure the
old count suddenly setting to work kept passing from the yard to the
house and back again shouting confused instructions to the hurrying
people and flurrying them still more pétya directed things in the
yard sónya owing to the counts contradictory orders lost her head
and did not know what to do the servants ran noisily about the house
and yard shouting and disputing natásha with the ardor characteristic
of all she did suddenly set to work too at first her intervention in
the business of packing was received skeptically everybody expected
some prank from her and did not wish to obey her but she resolutely and
passionately demanded obedience grew angry and nearly cried because
they did not heed her and at last succeeded in making them believe her
her first exploit which cost her immense effort and established her
authority was the packing of the carpets the count had valuable
gobelin tapestries and persian carpets in the house when natásha set to
work two cases were standing open in the ballroom one almost full up
with crockery the other with carpets there was also much china
standing on the tables and still more was being brought in from the
storeroom a third case was needed and servants had gone to fetch it

sónya wait a bitwell pack everything into these said natásha

you cant miss we have tried to said the butlers assistant

no wait a minute please

and natásha began rapidly taking out of the case dishes and plates
wrapped in paper

the dishes must go in here among the carpets said she

why its a mercy if we can get the carpets alone into three cases
said the butlers assistant

oh wait please and natásha began rapidly and deftly sorting out the
things these arent needed said she putting aside some plates of
kiev ware theseyes these must go among the carpets she said
referring to the saxony china dishes

dont natásha leave it alone well get it all packed urged sónya
reproachfully

what a young lady she is remarked the majordomo

but natásha would not give in she turned everything out and began
quickly repacking deciding that the inferior russian carpets and
unnecessary crockery should not be taken at all when everything had
been taken out of the cases they recommenced packing and it turned out
that when the cheaper things not worth taking had nearly all been
rejected the valuable ones really did all go into the two cases only
the lid of the case containing the carpets would not shut down a few
more things might have been taken out but natásha insisted on having
her own way she packed repacked pressed made the butlers assistant
and pétyawhom she had drawn into the business of packingpress on the
lid and made desperate efforts herself

thats enough natásha said sónya i see you were right but just
take out the top one

i wont cried natásha with one hand holding back the hair that hung
over her perspiring face while with the other she pressed down the
carpets now press pétya press vasílich press hard she cried

the carpets yielded and the lid closed natásha clapping her hands
screamed with delight and tears fell from her eyes but this only lasted
a moment she at once set to work afresh and they now trusted her
completely the count was not angry even when they told him that natásha
had countermanded an order of his and the servants now came to her to
ask whether a cart was sufficiently loaded and whether it might be
corded up thanks to natáshas directions the work now went on
expeditiously unnecessary things were left and the most valuable
packed as compactly as possible

but hard as they all worked till quite late that night they could not
get everything packed the countess had fallen asleep and the count
having put off their departure till next morning went to bed

sónya and natásha slept in the sitting room without undressing

that night another wounded man was driven down the povarskáya and mavra
kuzminichna who was standing at the gate had him brought into the
rostóvs yard mavra kuzminichna concluded that he was a very important
man he was being conveyed in a caleche with a raised hood and was
quite covered by an apron on the box beside the driver sat a venerable
old attendant a doctor and two soldiers followed the carriage in a
cart

please come in here the masters are going away and the whole house
will be empty said the old woman to the old attendant

well perhaps said he with a sigh we dont expect to get him home
alive we have a house of our own in moscow but its a long way from
here and theres nobody living in it

do us the honor to come in theres plenty of everything in the
masters house come in said mavra kuzminichna is he very ill she
asked

the attendant made a hopeless gesture

we dont expect to get him home we must ask the doctor

and the old servant got down from the box and went up to the cart

all right said the doctor

the old servant returned to the caleche looked into it shook his head
disconsolately told the driver to turn into the yard and stopped
beside mavra kuzminichna

o lord jesus christ she murmured

she invited them to take the wounded man into the house

the masters wont object she said

but they had to avoid carrying the man upstairs and so they took him
into the wing and put him in the room that had been madame schoss

this wounded man was prince andrew bolkónski





chapter xv

moscows last day had come it was a clear bright autumn day a sunday
the church bells everywhere were ringing for service just as usual on
sundays nobody seemed yet to realize what awaited the city

only two things indicated the social condition of moscowthe rabble
that is the poor people and the price of commodities an enormous crowd
of factory hands house serfs and peasants with whom some officials
seminarists and gentry were mingled had gone early that morning to the
three hills having waited there for rostopchin who did not turn up
they became convinced that moscow would be surrendered and then
dispersed all about the town to the public houses and cookshops prices
too that day indicated the state of affairs the price of weapons of
gold of carts and horses kept rising but the value of paper money and
city articles kept falling so that by midday there were instances of
carters removing valuable goods such as cloth and receiving in payment
a half of what they carted while peasant horses were fetching five
hundred rubles each and furniture mirrors and bronzes were being
given away for nothing

in the rostóvs staid oldfashioned house the dissolution of former
conditions of life was but little noticeable as to the serfs the only
indication was that three out of their huge retinue disappeared during
the night but nothing was stolen and as to the value of their
possessions the thirty peasant carts that had come in from their
estates and which many people envied proved to be extremely valuable and
they were offered enormous sums of money for them not only were huge
sums offered for the horses and carts but on the previous evening and
early in the morning of the first of september orderlies and servants
sent by wounded officers came to the rostóvs and wounded men dragged
themselves there from the rostóvs and from neighboring houses where
they were accommodated entreating the servants to try to get them a
lift out of moscow the majordomo to whom these entreaties were
addressed though he was sorry for the wounded resolutely refused
saying that he dare not even mention the matter to the count pity these
wounded men as one might it was evident that if they were given one
cart there would be no reason to refuse another or all the carts and
ones own carriages as well thirty carts could not save all the wounded
and in the general catastrophe one could not disregard oneself and ones
own family so thought the majordomo on his masters behalf

on waking up that morning count ilyá rostóv left his bedroom softly so
as not to wake the countess who had fallen asleep only toward morning
and came out to the porch in his lilac silk dressing gown in the yard
stood the carts ready corded the carriages were at the front porch the
majordomo stood at the porch talking to an elderly orderly and to a
pale young officer with a bandaged arm on seeing the count the major
domo made a significant and stern gesture to them both to go away

well vasílich is everything ready asked the count and stroking his
bald head he looked goodnaturedly at the officer and the orderly and
nodded to them he liked to see new faces

we can harness at once your excellency

well thats right as soon as the countess wakes well be off god
willing what is it gentlemen he added turning to the officer are
you staying in my house

the officer came nearer and suddenly his face flushed crimson

count be so good as to allow me for gods sake to get into some
corner of one of your carts i have nothing here with me i shall be
all right on a loaded cart

before the officer had finished speaking the orderly made the same
request on behalf of his master

oh yes yes yes said the count hastily i shall be very pleased
very pleased vasílich youll see to it just unload one or two carts
well what of it do whats necessary said the count muttering
some indefinite order

but at the same moment an expression of warm gratitude on the officers
face had already sealed the order the count looked around him in the
yard at the gates at the window of the wings wounded officers and
their orderlies were to be seen they were all looking at the count and
moving toward the porch

please step into the gallery your excellency said the majordomo
what are your orders about the pictures

the count went into the house with him repeating his order not to
refuse the wounded who asked for a lift

well never mind some of the things can be unloaded he added in a
soft confidential voice as though afraid of being overheard

at nine oclock the countess woke up and matrena timofeevna who had
been her ladys maid before her marriage and now performed a sort of
chief gendarmes duty for her came to say that madame schoss was much
offended and the young ladies summer dresses could not be left behind
on inquiry the countess learned that madame schoss was offended because
her trunk had been taken down from its cart and all the loads were
being uncorded and the luggage taken out of the carts to make room for
wounded men whom the count in the simplicity of his heart had ordered
that they should take with them the countess sent for her husband

what is this my dear i hear that the luggage is being unloaded

you know love i wanted to tell you countess dear an officer
came to me to ask for a few carts for the wounded after all ours are
things that can be bought but think what being left behind means to
them really now in our own yardwe asked them in ourselves and
there are officers among them you know i think my dear let them
be taken wheres the hurry

the count spoke timidly as he always did when talking of money matters
the countess was accustomed to this tone as a precursor of news of
something detrimental to the childrens interests such as the building
of a new gallery or conservatory the inauguration of a private theater
or an orchestra she was accustomed always to oppose anything announced
in that timid tone and considered it her duty to do so

she assumed her dolefully submissive manner and said to her husband
listen to me count you have managed matters so that we are getting
nothing for the house and now you wish to throw away all ourall the
childrens property you said yourself that we have a hundred thousand
rubles worth of things in the house i dont consent my dear i dont
do as you please its the governments business to look after the
wounded they know that look at the lopukhins opposite they cleared
out everything two days ago thats what other people do its only we
who are such fools if you have no pity on me have some for the
children

flourishing his arms in despair the count left the room without
replying

papa what are you doing that for asked natásha who had followed him
into her mothers room

nothing what business is it of yours muttered the count angrily

but i heard said natásha why does mamma object

what business is it of yours cried the count

natásha stepped up to the window and pondered

papa heres berg coming to see us said she looking out of the
window





chapter xvi

berg the rostóvs soninlaw was already a colonel wearing the orders
of vladimir and anna and he still filled the quiet and agreeable post
of assistant to the head of the staff of the assistant commander of the
first division of the second army

on the first of september he had come to moscow from the army

he had nothing to do in moscow but he had noticed that everyone in the
army was asking for leave to visit moscow and had something to do there
so he considered it necessary to ask for leave of absence for family and
domestic reasons

berg drove up to his fatherinlaws house in his spruce little trap
with a pair of sleek roans exactly like those of a certain prince he
looked attentively at the carts in the yard and while going up to the
porch took out a clean pocket handkerchief and tied a knot in it

from the anteroom berg ran with smooth though impatient steps into the
drawing room where he embraced the count kissed the hands of natásha
and sónya and hastened to inquire after mammas health

health at a time like this said the count come tell us the news
is the army retreating or will there be another battle

god almighty alone can decide the fate of our fatherland papa said
berg the army is burning with a spirit of heroism and the leaders so
to say have now assembled in council no one knows what is coming but
in general i can tell you papa that such a heroic spirit the truly
antique valor of the russian army which theywhich it he corrected
himself has shown or displayed in the battle of the twentysixththere
are no words worthy to do it justice i tell you papa he smote
himself on the breast as a general he had heard speaking had done but
berg did it a trifle late for he should have struck his breast at the
words russian army i tell you frankly that we the commanders far
from having to urge the men on or anything of that kind could hardly
restrain those those yes those exploits of antique valor he
went on rapidly general barclay de tolly risked his life everywhere at
the head of the troops i can assure you our corps was stationed on a
hillside you can imagine

and berg related all that he remembered of the various tales he had
heard those days natásha watched him with an intent gaze that confused
him as if she were trying to find in his face the answer to some
question

altogether such heroism as was displayed by the russian warriors cannot
be imagined or adequately praised said berg glancing round at
natásha and as if anxious to conciliate her replying to her intent
look with a smile russia is not in moscow she lives in the hearts of
her sons isnt it so papa said he

just then the countess came in from the sitting room with a weary and
dissatisfied expression berg hurriedly jumped up kissed her hand
asked about her health and swaying his head from side to side to
express sympathy remained standing beside her

yes mamma i tell you sincerely that these are hard and sad times for
every russian but why are you so anxious you have still time to get
away

i cant think what the servants are about said the countess turning
to her husband i have just been told that nothing is ready yet
somebody after all must see to things one misses mitenka at such times
there wont be any end to it

the count was about to say something but evidently restrained himself
he got up from his chair and went to the door

at that moment berg drew out his handkerchief as if to blow his nose
and seeing the knot in it pondered shaking his head sadly and
significantly

and i have a great favor to ask of you papa said he

hm said the count and stopped

i was driving past yusupovs house just now said berg with a laugh
when the steward a man i know ran out and asked me whether i wouldnt
buy something i went in out of curiosity you know and there is a
small chiffonier and a dressing table you know how dear véra wanted a
chiffonier like that and how we had a dispute about it at the mention
of the chiffonier and dressing table berg involuntarily changed his tone
to one of pleasure at his admirable domestic arrangements and its
such a beauty it pulls out and has a secret english drawer you know
and dear véra has long wanted one i wish to give her a surprise you
see i saw so many of those peasant carts in your yard please let me
have one i will pay the man well and

the count frowned and coughed

ask the countess i dont give orders

if its inconvenient please dont said berg only i so wanted it
for dear véras sake

oh go to the devil all of you to the devil the devil the devil
cried the old count my heads in a whirl

and he left the room the countess began to cry

yes mamma yes these are very hard times said berg

natásha left the room with her father and as if finding it difficult to
reach some decision first followed him and then ran downstairs

pétya was in the porch engaged in giving out weapons to the servants
who were to leave moscow the loaded carts were still standing in the
yard two of them had been uncorded and a wounded officer was climbing
into one of them helped by an orderly

do you know what its about pétya asked natásha

she understood that he meant what were their parents quarreling about
she did not answer

its because papa wanted to give up all the carts to the wounded said
pétya vasílich told me i consider

i consider natásha suddenly almost shouted turning her angry face to
pétya i consider it so horrid so abominable so i dont know what
are we despicable germans

her throat quivered with convulsive sobs and afraid of weakening and
letting the force of her anger run to waste she turned and rushed
headlong up the stairs

berg was sitting beside the countess consoling her with the respectful
attention of a relative the count pipe in hand was pacing up and down
the room when natásha her face distorted by anger burst in like a
tempest and approached her mother with rapid steps

its horrid its abominable she screamed you cant possibly have
ordered it

berg and the countess looked at her perplexed and frightened the count
stood still at the window and listened

mamma its impossible see what is going on in the yard she cried
they will be left

whats the matter with you who are they what do you want

why the wounded its impossible mamma its monstrous no mamma
darling its not the thing please forgive me darling mamma what
does it matter what we take away only look what is going on in the
yard mamma its impossible

the count stood by the window and listened without turning round
suddenly he sniffed and put his face closer to the window

the countess glanced at her daughter saw her face full of shame for her
mother saw her agitation and understood why her husband did not turn
to look at her now and she glanced round quite disconcerted

oh do as you like am i hindering anyone she said not surrendering
at once

mamma darling forgive me

but the countess pushed her daughter away and went up to her husband

my dear you order what is right you know i dont understand about
it said she dropping her eyes shamefacedly

the eggs the eggs are teaching the hen muttered the count through
tears of joy and he embraced his wife who was glad to hide her look of
shame on his breast

papa mamma may i see to it may i asked natásha we will still
take all the most necessary things

the count nodded affirmatively and natásha at the rapid pace at which
she used to run when playing at tag ran through the ballroom to the
anteroom and downstairs into the yard

the servants gathered round natásha but could not believe the strange
order she brought them until the count himself in his wifes name
confirmed the order to give up all the carts to the wounded and take the
trunks to the storerooms when they understood that order the servants
set to work at this new task with pleasure and zeal it no longer seemed
strange to them but on the contrary it seemed the only thing that could
be done just as a quarter of an hour before it had not seemed strange
to anyone that the wounded should be left behind and the goods carted
away but that had seemed the only thing to do

the whole household as if to atone for not having done it sooner set
eagerly to work at the new task of placing the wounded in the carts the
wounded dragged themselves out of their rooms and stood with pale but
happy faces round the carts the news that carts were to be had spread
to the neighboring houses from which wounded men began to come into the
rostóvs yard many of the wounded asked them not to unload the carts
but only to let them sit on the top of the things but the work of
unloading once started could not be arrested it seemed not to matter
whether all or only half the things were left behind cases full of
china bronzes pictures and mirrors that had been so carefully packed
the night before now lay about the yard and still they went on
searching for and finding possibilities of unloading this or that and
letting the wounded have another and yet another cart

we can take four more men said the steward they can have my trap
or else what is to become of them

let them have my wardrobe cart said the countess dunyasha can go
with me in the carriage

they unloaded the wardrobe cart and sent it to take wounded men from a
house two doors off the whole household servants included was bright
and animated natásha was in a state of rapturous excitement such as she
had not known for a long time

what could we fasten this onto asked the servants trying to fix a
trunk on the narrow footboard behind a carriage we must keep at least
one cart

whats in it asked natásha

the counts books

leave it vasílich will put it away its not wanted

the phaeton was full of people and there was a doubt as to where count
peter could sit

on the box youll sit on the box wont you pétya cried natásha

sónya too was busy all this time but the aim of her efforts was quite
different from natáshas she was putting away the things that had to be
left behind and making a list of them as the countess wished and she
tried to get as much taken away with them as possible





chapter xvii

before two oclock in the afternoon the rostóvs four carriages packed
full and with the horses harnessed stood at the front door one by one
the carts with the wounded had moved out of the yard

the caleche in which prince andrew was being taken attracted sónyas
attention as it passed the front porch with the help of a maid she was
arranging a seat for the countess in the huge high coach that stood at
the entrance

whose caleche is that she inquired leaning out of the carriage
window

why didnt you know miss replied the maid the wounded prince he
spent the night in our house and is going with us

but who is it whats his name

its our intended that wasprince bolkónski himself they say he is
dying replied the maid with a sigh

sónya jumped out of the coach and ran to the countess the countess
tired out and already dressed in shawl and bonnet for her journey was
pacing up and down the drawing room waiting for the household to
assemble for the usual silent prayer with closed doors before starting
natásha was not in the room

mamma said sónya prince andrew is here mortally wounded he is
going with us

the countess opened her eyes in dismay and seizing sónyas arm glanced
around

natásha she murmured

at that moment this news had only one significance for both of them
they knew their natásha and alarm as to what would happen if she heard
this news stifled all sympathy for the man they both liked

natásha does not know yet but he is going with us said sónya

you say he is dying

sónya nodded

the countess put her arms around sónya and began to cry

the ways of god are past finding out she thought feeling that the
almighty hand hitherto unseen was becoming manifest in all that was
now taking place

well mamma everything is ready whats the matter asked natásha as
with animated face she ran into the room

nothing answered the countess if everything is ready let us start

and the countess bent over her reticule to hide her agitated face sónya
embraced natásha and kissed her

natásha looked at her inquiringly

what is it what has happened

nothing no

is it something very bad for me what is it persisted natásha with
her quick intuition

sónya sighed and made no reply the count pétya madame schoss mavra
kuzminichna and vasílich came into the drawing room and having closed
the doors they all sat down and remained for some moments silently
seated without looking at one another

the count was the first to rise and with a loud sigh crossed himself
before the icon all the others did the same then the count embraced
mavra kuzminichna and vasílich who were to remain in moscow and while
they caught at his hand and kissed his shoulder he patted their backs
lightly with some vaguely affectionate and comforting words the
countess went into the oratory and there sónya found her on her knees
before the icons that had been left here and there hanging on the wall
the most precious ones with which some family tradition was connected
were being taken with them

in the porch and in the yard the men whom pétya had armed with swords
and daggers with trousers tucked inside their high boots and with belts
and girdles tightened were taking leave of those remaining behind

as is always the case at a departure much had been forgotten or put in
the wrong place and for a long time two menservants stood one on each
side of the open door and the carriage steps waiting to help the
countess in while maids rushed with cushions and bundles from the house
to the carriages the caleche the phaeton and back again

they always will forget everything said the countess dont you know
i cant sit like that

and dunyasha with clenched teeth without replying but with an
aggrieved look on her face hastily got into the coach to rearrange the
seat

oh those servants said the count swaying his head

efim the old coachman who was the only one the countess trusted to
drive her sat perched up high on the box and did not so much as glance
round at what was going on behind him from thirty years experience he
knew it would be some time yet before the order be off in gods
name would be given him and he knew that even when it was said he
would be stopped once or twice more while they sent back to fetch
something that had been forgotten and even after that he would again be
stopped and the countess herself would lean out of the window and beg
him for the love of heaven to drive carefully down the hill he knew all
this and therefore waited calmly for what would happen with more
patience than the horses especially the near one the chestnut falcon
who was pawing the ground and champing his bit at last all were seated
the carriage steps were folded and pulled up the door was shut
somebody was sent for a traveling case and the countess leaned out and
said what she had to say then efim deliberately doffed his hat and
began crossing himself the postilion and all the other servants did the
same off in gods name said efim putting on his hat start the
postilion started the horses the off pole horse tugged at his collar
the high springs creaked and the body of the coach swayed the footman
sprang onto the box of the moving coach which jolted as it passed out of
the yard onto the uneven roadway the other vehicles jolted in their
turn and the procession of carriages moved up the street in the
carriages the caleche and the phaeton all crossed themselves as they
passed the church opposite the house those who were to remain in moscow
walked on either side of the vehicles seeing the travelers off

rarely had natásha experienced so joyful a feeling as now sitting in
the carriage beside the countess and gazing at the slowly receding walls
of forsaken agitated moscow occasionally she leaned out of the
carriage window and looked back and then forward at the long train of
wounded in front of them almost at the head of the line she could see
the raised hood of prince andrews caleche she did not know who was in
it but each time she looked at the procession her eyes sought that
caleche she knew it was right in front

in kudrino from the nikitski presnya and podnovinsk streets came
several other trains of vehicles similar to the rostóvs and as they
passed along the sadovaya street the carriages and carts formed two rows
abreast

as they were going round the sukharev water tower natásha who was
inquisitively and alertly scrutinizing the people driving or walking
past suddenly cried out in joyful surprise

dear me mamma sónya look its he

who who

look yes on my word its bezúkhov said natásha putting her head
out of the carriage and staring at a tall stout man in a coachmans
long coat who from his manner of walking and moving was evidently a
gentleman in disguise and who was passing under the arch of the
sukharev tower accompanied by a small sallowfaced beardless old man
in a frieze coat

yes it really is bezúkhov in a coachmans coat with a queerlooking
old boy really said natásha look look

no its not he how can you talk such nonsense

mamma screamed natásha ill stake my head its he i assure you
stop stop she cried to the coachman

but the coachman could not stop for from the meshchanski street came
more carts and carriages and the rostóvs were being shouted at to move
on and not block the way

in fact however though now much farther off than before the rostóvs
all saw pierreor someone extraordinarily like himin a coachmans coat
going down the street with head bent and a serious face beside a small
beardless old man who looked like a footman that old man noticed a face
thrust out of the carriage window gazing at them and respectfully
touching pierres elbow said something to him and pointed to the
carriage pierre evidently engrossed in thought could not at first
understand him at length when he had understood and looked in the
direction the old man indicated he recognized natásha and following
his first impulse stepped instantly and rapidly toward the coach but
having taken a dozen steps he seemed to remember something and stopped

natáshas face leaning out of the window beamed with quizzical
kindliness

peter kirilovich come here we have recognized you this is
wonderful she cried holding out her hand to him what are you doing
why are you like this

pierre took her outstretched hand and kissed it awkwardly as he walked
along beside her while the coach still moved on

what is the matter count asked the countess in a surprised and
commiserating tone

what what why dont ask me said pierre and looked round at
natásha whose radiant happy expressionof which he was conscious
without looking at herfilled him with enchantment

are you remaining in moscow then

pierre hesitated

in moscow he said in a questioning tone yes in moscow goodbye

ah if only i were a man id certainly stay with you how splendid
said natásha mamma if youll let me ill stay

pierre glanced absently at natásha and was about to say something but
the countess interrupted him

you were at the battle we heard

yes i was pierre answered there will be another battle
tomorrow he began but natásha interrupted him

but what is the matter with you count you are not like yourself

oh dont ask me dont ask me i dont know myself tomorrow but
no goodbye goodby he muttered its an awful time and dropping
behind the carriage he stepped onto the pavement

natásha continued to lean out of the window for a long time beaming at
him with her kindly slightly quizzical happy smile





chapter xviii

for the last two days ever since leaving home pierre had been living
in the empty house of his deceased benefactor bazdeev this is how it
happened

when he woke up on the morning after his return to moscow and his
interview with count rostopchin he could not for some time make out
where he was and what was expected of him when he was informed that
among others awaiting him in his reception room there was a frenchman
who had brought a letter from his wife the countess hélène he felt
suddenly overcome by that sense of confusion and hopelessness to which
he was apt to succumb he felt that everything was now at an end all
was in confusion and crumbling to pieces that nobody was right or
wrong the future held nothing and there was no escape from this
position smiling unnaturally and muttering to himself he first sat
down on the sofa in an attitude of despair then rose went to the door
of the reception room and peeped through the crack returned flourishing
his arms and took up a book his majordomo came in a second time to
say that the frenchman who had brought the letter from the countess was
very anxious to see him if only for a minute and that someone from
bazdeevs widow had called to ask pierre to take charge of her husbands
books as she herself was leaving for the country

oh yes in a minute wait or no no of course go and say i will
come directly pierre replied to the majordomo

but as soon as the man had left the room pierre took up his hat which
was lying on the table and went out of his study by the other door
there was no one in the passage he went along the whole length of this
passage to the stairs and frowning and rubbing his forehead with both
hands went down as far as the first landing the hall porter was
standing at the front door from the landing where pierre stood there
was a second staircase leading to the back entrance he went down that
staircase and out into the yard no one had seen him but there were
some carriages waiting and as soon as pierre stepped out of the gate
the coachmen and the yard porter noticed him and raised their caps to
him when he felt he was being looked at he behaved like an ostrich
which hides its head in a bush in order not to be seen he hung his head
and quickening his pace went down the street

of all the affairs awaiting pierre that day the sorting of joseph
bazdeevs books and papers appeared to him the most necessary

he hired the first cab he met and told the driver to go to the
patriarchs ponds where the widow bazdeevs house was

continually turning round to look at the rows of loaded carts that were
making their way from all sides out of moscow and balancing his bulky
body so as not to slip out of the ramshackle old vehicle pierre
experiencing the joyful feeling of a boy escaping from school began to
talk to his driver

the man told him that arms were being distributed today at the kremlin
and that tomorrow everyone would be sent out beyond the three hills
gates and a great battle would be fought there

having reached the patriarchs ponds pierre found the bazdeevs house
where he had not been for a long time past he went up to the gate
gerasim that sallow beardless old man pierre had seen at torzhok five
years before with joseph bazdeev came out in answer to his knock

at home asked pierre

owing to the present state of things sophia danilovna has gone to the
torzhok estate with the children your excellency

i will come in all the same i have to look through the books said
pierre

be so good as to step in makar alexeevich the brother of my late
mastermay the kingdom of heaven be hishas remained here but he is in
a weak state as you know said the old servant

pierre knew that makar alexeevich was joseph bazdeevs halfinsane
brother and a hard drinker

yes yes i know let us go in said pierre and entered the house

a tall baldheaded old man with a red nose wearing a dressing gown and
with galoshes on his bare feet stood in the anteroom on seeing pierre
he muttered something angrily and went away along the passage

he was a very clever man but has now grown quite feeble as your honor
sees said gerasim will you step into the study pierre nodded as
it was sealed up so it has remained but sophia danilovna gave orders
that if anyone should come from you they were to have the books

pierre went into that gloomy study which he had entered with such
trepidation in his benefactors lifetime the room dusty and untouched
since the death of joseph bazdeev was now even gloomier

gerasim opened one of the shutters and left the room on tiptoe pierre
went round the study approached the cupboard in which the manuscripts
were kept and took out what had once been one of the most important
the holy of holies of the order this was the authentic scotch acts with
bazdeevs notes and explanations he sat down at the dusty writing
table and having laid the manuscripts before him opened them out
closed them finally pushed them away and resting his head on his hand
sank into meditation

gerasim looked cautiously into the study several times and saw pierre
always sitting in the same attitude

more than two hours passed and gerasim took the liberty of making a
slight noise at the door to attract his attention but pierre did not
hear him

is the cabman to be discharged your honor

oh yes said pierre rousing himself and rising hurriedly look
here he added taking gerasim by a button of his coat and looking down
at the old man with moist shining and ecstatic eyes i say do you
know that there is going to be a battle tomorrow

we heard so replied the man

i beg you not to tell anyone who i am and to do what i ask you

yes your excellency replied gerasim will you have something to
eat

no but i want something else i want peasant clothes and a pistol
said pierre unexpectedly blushing

yes your excellency said gerasim after thinking for a moment

all the rest of that day pierre spent alone in his benefactors study
and gerasim heard him pacing restlessly from one corner to another and
talking to himself and he spent the night on a bed made up for him
there

gerasim being a servant who in his time had seen many strange things
accepted pierres taking up his residence in the house without surprise
and seemed pleased to have someone to wait on that same eveningwithout
even asking himself what they were wanted forhe procured a coachmans
coat and cap for pierre and promised to get him the pistol next day
makar alexeevich came twice that evening shuffling along in his galoshes
as far as the door and stopped and looked ingratiatingly at pierre but
as soon as pierre turned toward him he wrapped his dressing gown around
him with a shamefaced and angry look and hurried away it was when
pierre wearing the coachmans coat which gerasim had procured for him
and had disinfected by steam was on his way with the old man to buy the
pistol at the sukharev market that he met the rostóvs





chapter xix

kutúzovs order to retreat through moscow to the ryazan road was issued
at night on the first of september

the first troops started at once and during the night they marched
slowly and steadily without hurry at daybreak however those nearing
the town at the dorogomilov bridge saw ahead of them masses of soldiers
crowding and hurrying across the bridge ascending on the opposite side
and blocking the streets and alleys while endless masses of troops were
bearing down on them from behind and an unreasoning hurry and alarm
overcame them they all rushed forward to the bridge onto it and to
the fords and the boats kutúzov himself had driven round by side
streets to the other side of moscow

by ten oclock in the morning of the second of september only the rear
guard remained in the dorogomilov suburb where they had ample room the
main army was on the other side of moscow or beyond it

at that very time at ten in the morning of the second of september
napoleon was standing among his troops on the poklonny hill looking at
the panorama spread out before him from the twentysixth of august to
the second of september that is from the battle of borodino to the
entry of the french into moscow during the whole of that agitating
memorable week there had been the extraordinary autumn weather that
always comes as a surprise when the sun hangs low and gives more heat
than in spring when everything shines so brightly in the rare clear
atmosphere that the eyes smart when the lungs are strengthened and
refreshed by inhaling the aromatic autumn air when even the nights are
warm and when in those dark warm nights golden stars startle and
delight us continually by falling from the sky

at ten in the morning of the second of september this weather still
held

the brightness of the morning was magical moscow seen from the poklonny
hill lay spaciously spread out with her river her gardens and her
churches and she seemed to be living her usual life her cupolas
glittering like stars in the sunlight

the view of the strange city with its peculiar architecture such as he
had never seen before filled napoleon with the rather envious and
uneasy curiosity men feel when they see an alien form of life that has
no knowledge of them this city was evidently living with the full force
of its own life by the indefinite signs which even at a distance
distinguish a living body from a dead one napoleon from the poklonny
hill perceived the throb of life in the town and felt as it were the
breathing of that great and beautiful body

every russian looking at moscow feels her to be a mother every
foreigner who sees her even if ignorant of her significance as the
mother city must feel her feminine character and napoleon felt it

cette ville asiatique aux innombrables eglises moscou la sainte la
voila done enfin cette fameuse ville il etait temps  said he and
dismounting he ordered a plan of moscow to be spread out before him and
summoned lelorgne dideville the interpreter

 that asiatic city of the innumerable churches holy moscow here it
is then at last that famous city it was high time

a town captured by the enemy is like a maid who has lost her honor
thought he he had said so to tuchkov at smolensk from that point of
view he gazed at the oriental beauty he had not seen before it seemed
strange to him that his longfelt wish which had seemed unattainable
had at last been realized in the clear morning light he gazed now at
the city and now at the plan considering its details and the assurance
of possessing it agitated and awed him

but could it be otherwise he thought here is this capital at my
feet where is alexander now and of what is he thinking a strange
beautiful and majestic city and a strange and majestic moment in what
light must i appear to them thought he thinking of his troops here
she is the reward for all those fainthearted men he reflected
glancing at those near him and at the troops who were approaching and
forming up one word from me one movement of my hand and that ancient
capital of the tsars would perish but my clemency is always ready to
descend upon the vanquished i must be magnanimous and truly great but
no it cant be true that i am in moscow he suddenly thought yet
here she is lying at my feet with her golden domes and crosses
scintillating and twinkling in the sunshine but i shall spare her on
the ancient monuments of barbarism and despotism i will inscribe great
words of justice and mercy it is just this which alexander will feel
most painfully i know him it seemed to napoleon that the chief
import of what was taking place lay in the personal struggle between
himself and alexander from the height of the kremlinyes there is
the kremlin yesi will give them just laws i will teach them the
meaning of true civilization i will make generations of boyars remember
their conqueror with love i will tell the deputation that i did not
and do not desire war that i have waged war only against the false
policy of their court that i love and respect alexander and that in
moscow i will accept terms of peace worthy of myself and of my people i
do not wish to utilize the fortunes of war to humiliate an honored
monarch boyars i will say to them i do not desire war i desire
the peace and welfare of all my subjects however i know their
presence will inspire me and i shall speak to them as i always do
clearly impressively and majestically but can it be true that i am in
moscow yes there she lies

quon mamene les boyars  said he to his suite

 bring the boyars to me

a general with a brilliant suite galloped off at once to fetch the
boyars

two hours passed napoleon had lunched and was again standing in the
same place on the poklonny hill awaiting the deputation his speech to
the boyars had already taken definite shape in his imagination that
speech was full of dignity and greatness as napoleon understood it

he was himself carried away by the tone of magnanimity he intended to
adopt toward moscow in his imagination he appointed days for assemblies
at the palace of the tsars at which russian notables and his own would
mingle he mentally appointed a governor one who would win the hearts
of the people having learned that there were many charitable
institutions in moscow he mentally decided that he would shower favors
on them all he thought that as in africa he had to put on a burnoose
and sit in a mosque so in moscow he must be beneficent like the tsars
and in order finally to touch the hearts of the russiansand being like
all frenchmen unable to imagine anything sentimental without a reference
to ma chere ma tendre ma pauvre mere  he decided that he would place
an inscription on all these establishments in large letters this
establishment is dedicated to my dear mother or no it should be
simply maison de ma mere  he concluded but am i really in
moscow yes here it lies before me but why is the deputation from the
city so long in appearing he wondered

 my dear my tender my poor mother

  house of my mother

meanwhile an agitated consultation was being carried on in whispers
among his generals and marshals at the rear of his suite those sent to
fetch the deputation had returned with the news that moscow was empty
that everyone had left it the faces of those who were not conferring
together were pale and perturbed they were not alarmed by the fact that
moscow had been abandoned by its inhabitants grave as that fact
seemed but by the question how to tell the emperorwithout putting him
in the terrible position of appearing ridiculousthat he had been
awaiting the boyars so long in vain that there were drunken mobs left
in moscow but no one else some said that a deputation of some sort must
be scraped together others disputed that opinion and maintained that
the emperor should first be carefully and skillfully prepared and then
told the truth

he will have to be told all the same said some gentlemen of the
suite but gentlemen

the position was the more awkward because the emperor meditating upon
his magnanimous plans was pacing patiently up and down before the
outspread map occasionally glancing along the road to moscow from under
his lifted hand with a bright and proud smile

but its impossible declared the gentlemen of the suite shrugging
their shoulders but not venturing to utter the implied wordle
ridicule

at last the emperor tired of futile expectation his actors instinct
suggesting to him that the sublime moment having been too long drawn out
was beginning to lose its sublimity gave a sign with his hand a single
report of a signaling gun followed and the troops who were already
spread out on different sides of moscow moved into the city through
tver kaluga and dorogomilov gates faster and faster vying with one
another they moved at the double or at a trot vanishing amid the
clouds of dust they raised and making the air ring with a deafening roar
of mingling shouts

drawn on by the movement of his troops napoleon rode with them as far as
the dorogomilov gate but there again stopped and dismounting from his
horse paced for a long time by the kammerkollezski rampart awaiting
the deputation





chapter xx

meanwhile moscow was empty there were still people in it perhaps a
fiftieth part of its former inhabitants had remained but it was empty
it was empty in the sense that a dying queenless hive is empty

in a queenless hive no life is left though to a superficial glance it
seems as much alive as other hives

the bees circle round a queenless hive in the hot beams of the midday
sun as gaily as around the living hives from a distance it smells of
honey like the others and bees fly in and out in the same way but one
has only to observe that hive to realize that there is no longer any
life in it the bees do not fly in the same way the smell and the sound
that meet the beekeeper are not the same to the beekeepers tap on the
wall of the sick hive instead of the former instant unanimous humming
of tens of thousands of bees with their abdomens threateningly
compressed and producing by the rapid vibration of their wings an
aerial living sound the only reply is a disconnected buzzing from
different parts of the deserted hive from the alighting board instead
of the former spirituous fragrant smell of honey and venom and the warm
whiffs of crowded life comes an odor of emptiness and decay mingling
with the smell of honey there are no longer sentinels sounding the
alarm with their abdomens raised and ready to die in defense of the
hive there is no longer the measured quiet sound of throbbing activity
like the sound of boiling water but diverse discordant sounds of
disorder in and out of the hive long black robber bees smeared with
honey fly timidly and shiftily they do not sting but crawl away from
danger formerly only bees laden with honey flew into the hive and they
flew out empty now they fly out laden the beekeeper opens the lower
part of the hive and peers in instead of black glossy beestamed by
toil clinging to one anothers legs and drawing out the wax with a
ceaseless hum of laborthat used to hang in long clusters down to the
floor of the hive drowsy shriveled bees crawl about separately in
various directions on the floor and walls of the hive instead of a
neatly glued floor swept by the bees with the fanning of their wings
there is a floor littered with bits of wax excrement dying bees
scarcely moving their legs and dead ones that have not been cleared
away

the beekeeper opens the upper part of the hive and examines the super
instead of serried rows of bees sealing up every gap in the combs and
keeping the brood warm he sees the skillful complex structures of the
combs but no longer in their former state of purity all is neglected
and foul black robber bees are swiftly and stealthily prowling about
the combs and the short home bees shriveled and listless as if they
were old creep slowly about without trying to hinder the robbers
having lost all motive and all sense of life drones bumblebees wasps
and butterflies knock awkwardly against the walls of the hive in their
flight here and there among the cells containing dead brood and honey
an angry buzzing can sometimes be heard here and there a couple of
bees by force of habit and custom cleaning out the brood cells with
efforts beyond their strength laboriously drag away a dead bee or
bumblebee without knowing why they do it in another corner two old bees
are languidly fighting or cleaning themselves or feeding one another
without themselves knowing whether they do it with friendly or hostile
intent in a third place a crowd of bees crushing one another attack
some victim and fight and smother it and the victim enfeebled or
killed drops from above slowly and lightly as a feather among the heap
of corpses the keeper opens the two center partitions to examine the
brood cells in place of the former close dark circles formed by
thousands of bees sitting back to back and guarding the high mystery of
generation he sees hundreds of dull listless and sleepy shells of
bees they have almost all died unawares sitting in the sanctuary they
had guarded and which is now no more they reek of decay and death only
a few of them still move rise and feebly fly to settle on the enemys
hand lacking the spirit to die stinging him the rest are dead and fall
as lightly as fish scales the beekeeper closes the hive chalks a mark
on it and when he has time tears out its contents and burns it clean

so in the same way moscow was empty when napoleon weary uneasy and
morose paced up and down in front of the kammerkollezski rampart
awaiting what to his mind was a necessary if but formal observance of
the proprietiesa deputation

in various corners of moscow there still remained a few people aimlessly
moving about following their old habits and hardly aware of what they
were doing

when with due circumspection napoleon was informed that moscow was
empty he looked angrily at his informant turned away and silently
continued to walk to and fro

my carriage he said

he took his seat beside the aidedecamp on duty and drove into the
suburb moscow deserted he said to himself what an incredible
event

he did not drive into the town but put up at an inn in the dorogomilov
suburb

the coup de theatre had not come off





chapter xxi

the russian troops were passing through moscow from two oclock at night
till two in the afternoon and bore away with them the wounded and the
last of the inhabitants who were leaving

the greatest crush during the movement of the troops took place at the
stone moskva and yauza bridges

while the troops dividing into two parts when passing around the
kremlin were thronging the moskva and the stone bridges a great many
soldiers taking advantage of the stoppage and congestion turned back
from the bridges and slipped stealthily and silently past the church of
vasíli the beatified and under the borovitski gate back up the hill to
the red square where some instinct told them they could easily take
things not belonging to them crowds of the kind seen at cheap sales
filled all the passages and alleys of the bazaar but there were no
dealers with voices of ingratiating affability inviting customers to
enter there were no hawkers nor the usual motley crowd of female
purchasersbut only soldiers in uniforms and overcoats though without
muskets entering the bazaar emptyhanded and silently making their way
out through its passages with bundles tradesmen and their assistants
of whom there were but few moved about among the soldiers quite
bewildered they unlocked their shops and locked them up again and
themselves carried goods away with the help of their assistants on the
square in front of the bazaar were drummers beating the muster call but
the roll of the drums did not make the looting soldiers run in the
direction of the drum as formerly but made them on the contrary run
farther away among the soldiers in the shops and passages some men were
to be seen in gray coats with closely shaven heads two officers one
with a scarf over his uniform and mounted on a lean darkgray horse
the other in an overcoat and on foot stood at the corner of ilyinka
street talking a third officer galloped up to them

the general orders them all to be driven out at once without fail
this is outrageous half the men have dispersed

where are you off to where he shouted to three infantrymen
without muskets who holding up the skirts of their overcoats were
slipping past him into the bazaar passage stop you rascals

but how are you going to stop them replied another officer there is
no getting them together the army should push on before the rest bolt
thats all

how can one push on they are stuck there wedged on the bridge and
dont move shouldnt we put a cordon round to prevent the rest from
running away

come go in there and drive them out shouted the senior officer

the officer in the scarf dismounted called up a drummer and went with
him into the arcade some soldiers started running away in a group a
shopkeeper with red pimples on his cheeks near the nose and a calm
persistent calculating expression on his plump face hurriedly and
ostentatiously approached the officer swinging his arms

your honor said he be so good as to protect us we wont grudge
trifles you are welcome to anythingwe shall be delighted pray
ill fetch a piece of cloth at once for such an honorable gentleman or
even two pieces with pleasure for we feel how it is but whats all
thissheer robbery if you please could not guards be placed if only to
let us close the shop

several shopkeepers crowded round the officer

eh what twaddle said one of them a thin sternlooking man when
ones head is gone one doesnt weep for ones hair take what any of you
like and flourishing his arm energetically he turned sideways to the
officer

its all very well for you ivan sidorych to talk said the first
tradesman angrily please step inside your honor

talk indeed cried the thin one in my three shops here i have a
hundred thousand rubles worth of goods can they be saved when the army
has gone eh what people against gods might our hands cant fight

come inside your honor repeated the tradesman bowing

the officer stood perplexed and his face showed indecision

its not my business he exclaimed and strode on quickly down one of
the passages

from one open shop came the sound of blows and vituperation and just as
the officer came up to it a man in a gray coat with a shaven head was
flung out violently

this man bent double rushed past the tradesman and the officer the
officer pounced on the soldiers who were in the shops but at that
moment fearful screams reached them from the huge crowd on the moskva
bridge and the officer ran out into the square

what is it what is it he asked but his comrade was already
galloping off past vasíli the beatified in the direction from which the
screams came

the officer mounted his horse and rode after him when he reached the
bridge he saw two unlimbered guns the infantry crossing the bridge
several overturned carts and frightened and laughing faces among the
troops beside the cannon a cart was standing to which two horses were
harnessed four borzois with collars were pressing close to the wheels
the cart was loaded high and at the very top beside a childs chair
with its legs in the air sat a peasant woman uttering piercing and
desperate shrieks he was told by his fellow officers that the screams
of the crowd and the shrieks of the woman were due to the fact that
general ermolov coming up to the crowd and learning that soldiers were
dispersing among the shops while crowds of civilians blocked the bridge
had ordered two guns to be unlimbered and made a show of firing at the
bridge the crowd crushing one another upsetting carts and shouting
and squeezing desperately had cleared off the bridge and the troops
were now moving forward





chapter xxii

meanwhile the city itself was deserted there was hardly anyone in the
streets the gates and shops were all closed only here and there round
the taverns solitary shouts or drunken songs could be heard nobody
drove through the streets and footsteps were rarely heard the
povarskáya was quite still and deserted the huge courtyard of the
rostóvs house was littered with wisps of hay and with dung from the
horses and not a soul was to be seen there in the great drawing room
of the house which had been left with all it contained were two
people they were the yard porter ignat and the page boy mishka
vasílichs grandson who had stayed in moscow with his grandfather
mishka had opened the clavichord and was strumming on it with one
finger the yard porter his arms akimbo stood smiling with
satisfaction before the large mirror

isnt it fine eh uncle ignat said the boy suddenly beginning to
strike the keyboard with both hands

only fancy answered ignat surprised at the broadening grin on his
face in the mirror

impudence impudence they heard behind them the voice of mavra
kuzminichna who had entered silently how hes grinning the fat mug
is that what youre here for nothings cleared away down there and
vasílich is worn out just you wait a bit

ignat left off smiling adjusted his belt and went out of the room with
meekly downcast eyes

aunt i did it gently said the boy

ill give you something gently you monkey you cried mavra
kuzminichna raising her arm threateningly go and get the samovar to
boil for your grandfather

mavra kuzminichna flicked the dust off the clavichord and closed it and
with a deep sigh left the drawing room and locked its main door

going out into the yard she paused to consider where she should go
nextto drink tea in the servants wing with vasílich or into the
storeroom to put away what still lay about

she heard the sound of quick footsteps in the quiet street someone
stopped at the gate and the latch rattled as someone tried to open it
mavra kuzminichna went to the gate

who do you want

the countcount ilyá andréevich rostóv

and who are you

an officer i have to see him came the reply in a pleasant wellbred
russian voice

mavra kuzminichna opened the gate and an officer of eighteen with the
round face of a rostóv entered the yard

they have gone away sir went away yesterday at vespertime said
mavra kuzminichna cordially

the young officer standing in the gateway as if hesitating whether to
enter or not clicked his tongue

ah how annoying he muttered i should have come yesterday ah
what a pity

meanwhile mavra kuzminichna was attentively and sympathetically
examining the familiar rostóv features of the young mans face his
tattered coat and troddendown boots

what did you want to see the count for she asked

oh well it cant be helped said he in a tone of vexation and
placed his hand on the gate as if to leave

he again paused in indecision

you see he suddenly said i am a kinsman of the counts and he has
been very kind to me as you see he glanced with an amused air and
goodnatured smile at his coat and boots my things are worn out and i
have no money so i was going to ask the count

mavra kuzminichna did not let him finish

just wait a minute sir one little moment said she

and as soon as the officer let go of the gate handle she turned and
hurrying away on her old legs went through the back yard to the
servants quarters

while mavra kuzminichna was running to her room the officer walked about
the yard gazing at his wornout boots with lowered head and a faint
smile on his lips what a pity ive missed uncle what a nice old
woman where has she run off to and how am i to find the nearest way to
overtake my regiment which must by now be getting near the rogozhski
gate thought he just then mavra kuzminichna appeared from behind the
corner of the house with a frightened yet resolute look carrying a
rolledup check kerchief in her hand while still a few steps from the
officer she unfolded the kerchief and took out of it a white twenty
fiveruble assignat and hastily handed it to him

if his excellency had been at home as a kinsman he would of course
but as it is

mavra kuzminichna grew abashed and confused the officer did not
decline but took the note quietly and thanked her

if the count had been at home mavra kuzminichna went on
apologetically christ be with you sir may god preserve you said
she bowing as she saw him out

swaying his head and smiling as if amused at himself the officer ran
almost at a trot through the deserted streets toward the yauza bridge to
overtake his regiment

but mavra kuzminichna stood at the closed gate for some time with moist
eyes pensively swaying her head and feeling an unexpected flow of
motherly tenderness and pity for the unknown young officer





chapter xxiii

from an unfinished house on the varvarka the ground floor of which was
a dramshop came drunken shouts and songs on benches round the tables
in a dirty little room sat some ten factory hands tipsy and perspiring
with dim eyes and wideopen mouths they were all laboriously singing
some song or other they were singing discordantly arduously and with
great effort evidently not because they wished to sing but because
they wanted to show they were drunk and on a spree one a tall fair
haired lad in a clean blue coat was standing over the others his face
with its fine straight nose would have been handsome had it not been for
his thin compressed twitching lips and dull gloomy fixed eyes
evidently possessed by some idea he stood over those who were singing
and solemnly and jerkily flourished above their heads his white arm with
the sleeve turned up to the elbow trying unnaturally to spread out his
dirty fingers the sleeve of his coat kept slipping down and he always
carefully rolled it up again with his left hand as if it were most
important that the sinewy white arm he was flourishing should be bare
in the midst of the song cries were heard and fighting and blows in the
passage and porch the tall lad waved his arm

stop it he exclaimed peremptorily theres a fight lads and
still rolling up his sleeve he went out to the porch

the factory hands followed him these men who under the leadership of
the tall lad were drinking in the dramshop that morning had brought the
publican some skins from the factory and for this had had drink served
them the blacksmiths from a neighboring smithy hearing the sounds of
revelry in the tavern and supposing it to have been broken into wished
to force their way in too and a fight in the porch had resulted

the publican was fighting one of the smiths at the door and when the
workmen came out the smith wrenching himself free from the tavern
keeper fell face downward on the pavement

another smith tried to enter the doorway pressing against the publican
with his chest

the lad with the turnedup sleeve gave the smith a blow in the face and
cried wildly theyre fighting us lads

at that moment the first smith got up and scratching his bruised face
to make it bleed shouted in a tearful voice police murder
theyve killed a man lads

oh gracious me a man beaten to deathkilled screamed a woman
coming out of a gate close by

a crowd gathered round the bloodstained smith

havent you robbed people enoughtaking their last shirts said a
voice addressing the publican what have you killed a man for you
thief

the tall lad standing in the porch turned his bleared eyes from the
publican to the smith and back again as if considering whom he ought to
fight now

murderer he shouted suddenly to the publican bind him lads

i daresay you would like to bind me shouted the publican pushing
away the men advancing on him and snatching his cap from his head he
flung it on the ground

as if this action had some mysterious and menacing significance the
workmen surrounding the publican paused in indecision

i know the law very well mates ill take the matter to the captain of
police you think i wont get to him robbery is not permitted to
anybody now a days shouted the publican picking up his cap

come along then come along then the publican and the tall young
fellow repeated one after the other and they moved up the street
together

the bloodstained smith went beside them the factory hands and others
followed behind talking and shouting

at the corner of the moroseyka opposite a large house with closed
shutters and bearing a bootmakers signboard stood a score of thin
wornout gloomyfaced bootmakers wearing overalls and long tattered
coats

he should pay folks off properly a thin workingman with frowning
brows and a straggly beard was saying

but hes sucked our blood and now he thinks hes quit of us hes been
misleading us all the week and now that hes brought us to this pass
hes made off

on seeing the crowd and the bloodstained man the workman ceased
speaking and with eager curiosity all the bootmakers joined the moving
crowd

where are all the folks going

why to the police of course

i say is it true that we have been beaten and what did you think
look what folks are saying

questions and answers were heard the publican taking advantage of the
increased crowd dropped behind and returned to his tavern

the tall youth not noticing the disappearance of his foe waved his
bare arm and went on talking incessantly attracting general attention
to himself it was around him that the people chiefly crowded expecting
answers from him to the questions that occupied all their minds

he must keep order keep the law thats what the government is there
for am i not right good christians said the tall youth with a
scarcely perceptible smile he thinks theres no government how can
one do without government or else there would be plenty whod rob us

why talk nonsense rejoined voices in the crowd will they give up
moscow like this they told you that for fun and you believed it
arent there plenty of troops on the march let him in indeed thats
what the government is for youd better listen to what people are
saying said some of the mob pointing to the tall youth

by the wall of chinatown a smaller group of people were gathered round
a man in a frieze coat who held a paper in his hand

an ukase they are reading an ukase reading an ukase cried voices in
the crowd and the people rushed toward the reader

the man in the frieze coat was reading the broadsheet of august  when
the crowd collected round him he seemed confused but at the demand of
the tall lad who had pushed his way up to him he began in a rather
tremulous voice to read the sheet from the beginning

early tomorrow i shall go to his serene highness he read sirin
highness said the tall fellow with a triumphant smile on his lips and
a frown on his brow to consult with him to act and to aid the army
to exterminate these scoundrels we too will take part the reader
went on and then paused do you see shouted the youth victoriously
hes going to clear up the whole affair for you in destroying
them and will send these visitors to the devil i will come back to
dinner and well set to work we will do completely do and undo these
scoundrels

the last words were read out in the midst of complete silence the tall
lad hung his head gloomily it was evident that no one had understood
the last part in particular the words i will come back to dinner
evidently displeased both reader and audience the peoples minds were
tuned to a high pitch and this was too simple and needlessly
comprehensibleit was what anyone of them might have said and therefore
was what an ukase emanating from the highest authority should not say

they all stood despondent and silent the tall youth moved his lips and
swayed from side to side

we should ask him thats he himself yes ask him indeed
why not hell explain voices in the rear of the crowd were suddenly
heard saying and the general attention turned to the police
superintendents trap which drove into the square attended by two
mounted dragoons

the superintendent of police who had gone that morning by count
rostopchins orders to burn the barges and had in connection with that
matter acquired a large sum of money which was at that moment in his
pocket on seeing a crowd bearing down upon him told his coachman to
stop

what people are these he shouted to the men who were moving singly
and timidly in the direction of his trap

what people are these he shouted again receiving no answer

your honor replied the shopman in the frieze coat your honor in
accord with the proclamation of his highest excellency the count they
desire to serve not sparing their lives and it is not any kind of
riot but as his highest excellence said

the count has not left he is here and an order will be issued
concerning you said the superintendent of police go on he ordered
his coachman

the crowd halted pressing around those who had heard what the
superintendent had said and looking at the departing trap

the superintendent of police turned round at that moment with a scared
look said something to his coachman and his horses increased their
speed

its a fraud lads lead the way to him himself shouted the tall
youth dont let him go lads let him answer us keep him shouted
different people and the people dashed in pursuit of the trap

following the superintendent of police and talking loudly the crowd went
in the direction of the lubyanka street

there now the gentry and merchants have gone away and left us to
perish do they think were dogs voices in the crowd were heard saying
more and more frequently





chapter xxiv

on the evening of the first of september after his interview with
kutúzov count rostopchin had returned to moscow mortified and offended
because he had not been invited to attend the council of war and
because kutúzov had paid no attention to his offer to take part in the
defense of the city amazed also at the novel outlook revealed to him at
the camp which treated the tranquillity of the capital and its
patriotic fervor as not merely secondary but quite irrelevant and
unimportant matters distressed offended and surprised by all this
rostopchin had returned to moscow after supper he lay down on a sofa
without undressing and was awakened soon after midnight by a courier
bringing him a letter from kutúzov this letter requested the count to
send police officers to guide the troops through the town as the army
was retreating to the ryazan road beyond moscow this was not news to
rostopchin he had known that moscow would be abandoned not merely since
his interview the previous day with kutúzov on the poklonny hill but
ever since the battle of borodino for all the generals who came to
moscow after that battle had said unanimously that it was impossible to
fight another battle and since then the government property had been
removed every night and half the inhabitants had left the city with
rostopchins own permission yet all the same this information
astonished and irritated the count coming as it did in the form of a
simple note with an order from kutúzov and received at night breaking
in on his beauty sleep

when later on in his memoirs count rostopchin explained his actions at
this time he repeatedly says that he was then actuated by two important
considerations to maintain tranquillity in moscow and expedite the
departure of the inhabitants if one accepts this twofold aim all
rostopchins actions appear irreproachable why were the holy relics
the arms ammunition gunpowder and stores of corn not removed why
were thousands of inhabitants deceived into believing that moscow would
not be given upand thereby ruined to preserve the tranquillity of
the city explains count rostopchin why were bundles of useless
papers from the government offices and leppichs balloon and other
articles removed to leave the town empty explains count rostopchin
one need only admit that public tranquillity is in danger and any action
finds a justification

all the horrors of the reign of terror were based only on solicitude for
public tranquillity

on what then was count rostopchins fear for the tranquillity of
moscow based in  what reason was there for assuming any probability
of an uprising in the city the inhabitants were leaving it and the
retreating troops were filling it why should that cause the masses to
riot

neither in moscow nor anywhere in russia did anything resembling an
insurrection ever occur when the enemy entered a town more than ten
thousand people were still in moscow on the first and second of
september and except for a mob in the governors courtyard assembled
there at his bidding nothing happened it is obvious that there would
have been even less reason to expect a disturbance among the people if
after the battle of borodino when the surrender of moscow became
certain or at least probable rostopchin instead of exciting the people
by distributing arms and broadsheets had taken steps to remove all the
holy relics the gunpowder munitions and money and had told the
population plainly that the town would be abandoned

rostopchin though he had patriotic sentiments was a sanguine and
impulsive man who had always moved in the highest administrative circles
and had no understanding at all of the people he supposed himself to be
guiding ever since the enemys entry into smolensk he had in
imagination been playing the role of director of the popular feeling of
the heart of russia not only did it seem to him as to all
administrators that he controlled the external actions of moscows
inhabitants but he also thought he controlled their mental attitude by
means of his broadsheets and posters written in a coarse tone which the
people despise in their own class and do not understand from those in
authority rostopchin was so pleased with the fine role of leader of
popular feeling and had grown so used to it that the necessity of
relinquishing that role and abandoning moscow without any heroic display
took him unawares and he suddenly felt the ground slip away from under
his feet so that he positively did not know what to do though he knew
it was coming he did not till the last moment wholeheartedly believe
that moscow would be abandoned and did not prepare for it the
inhabitants left against his wishes if the government offices were
removed this was only done on the demand of officials to whom the count
yielded reluctantly he was absorbed in the role he had created for
himself as is often the case with those gifted with an ardent
imagination though he had long known that moscow would be abandoned he
knew it only with his intellect he did not believe it in his heart and
did not adapt himself mentally to this new position of affairs

all his painstaking and energetic activity in how far it was useful and
had any effect on the people is another question had been simply
directed toward arousing in the masses his own feeling of patriotic
hatred of the french

but when events assumed their true historical character when expressing
hatred for the french in words proved insufficient when it was not even
possible to express that hatred by fighting a battle when self
confidence was of no avail in relation to the one question before
moscow when the whole population streamed out of moscow as one man
abandoning their belongings and proving by that negative action all the
depth of their national feeling then the role chosen by rostopchin
suddenly appeared senseless he unexpectedly felt himself ridiculous
weak and alone with no ground to stand on

when awakened from his sleep he received that cold peremptory note
from kutúzov he felt the more irritated the more he felt himself to
blame all that he had been specially put in charge of the state
property which he should have removed was still in moscow and it was no
longer possible to take the whole of it away

who is to blame for it who has let things come to such a pass he
ruminated not i of course i had everything ready i had moscow
firmly in hand and this is what they have let it come to villains
traitors he thought without clearly defining who the villains and
traitors were but feeling it necessary to hate those traitors whoever
they might be who were to blame for the false and ridiculous position in
which he found himself

all that night count rostopchin issued orders for which people came to
him from all parts of moscow those about him had never seen the count
so morose and irritable

your excellency the director of the registrars department has sent
for instructions from the consistory from the senate from the
university from the foundling hospital the suffragan has sent
asking for information what are your orders about the fire brigade
from the governor of the prison from the superintendent of the
lunatic asylum all night long such announcements were continually
being received by the count

to all these inquiries he gave brief and angry replies indicating that
orders from him were not now needed that the whole affair carefully
prepared by him had now been ruined by somebody and that that somebody
would have to bear the whole responsibility for all that might happen

oh tell that blockhead he said in reply to the question from the
registrars department that he should remain to guard his documents
now why are you asking silly questions about the fire brigade they have
horses let them be off to vladimir and not leave them to the french

your excellency the superintendent of the lunatic asylum has come
what are your commands

my commands let them go away thats all and let the lunatics out
into the town when lunatics command our armies god evidently means
these other madmen to be free

in reply to an inquiry about the convicts in the prison count
rostopchin shouted angrily at the governor

do you expect me to give you two battalionswhich we have not gotfor a
convoy release them thats all about it

your excellency there are some political prisoners meshkov
vereshchagin

vereshchagin hasnt he been hanged yet shouted rostopchin bring
him to me





chapter xxv

toward nine oclock in the morning when the troops were already moving
through moscow nobody came to the count any more for instructions
those who were able to get away were going of their own accord those
who remained behind decided for themselves what they must do

the count ordered his carriage that he might drive to sokolniki and sat
in his study with folded hands morose sallow and taciturn

in quiet and untroubled times it seems to every administrator that it is
only by his efforts that the whole population under his rule is kept
going and in this consciousness of being indispensable every
administrator finds the chief reward of his labor and efforts while the
sea of history remains calm the ruleradministrator in his frail bark
holding on with a boat hook to the ship of the people and himself
moving naturally imagines that his efforts move the ship he is holding
on to but as soon as a storm arises and the sea begins to heave and the
ship to move such a delusion is no longer possible the ship moves
independently with its own enormous motion the boat hook no longer
reaches the moving vessel and suddenly the administrator instead of
appearing a ruler and a source of power becomes an insignificant
useless feeble man

rostopchin felt this and it was this which exasperated him

the superintendent of police whom the crowd had stopped went in to see
him at the same time as an adjutant who informed the count that the
horses were harnessed they were both pale and the superintendent of
police after reporting that he had executed the instructions he had
received informed the count that an immense crowd had collected in the
courtyard and wished to see him

without saying a word rostopchin rose and walked hastily to his light
luxurious drawing room went to the balcony door took hold of the
handle let it go again and went to the window from which he had a
better view of the whole crowd the tall lad was standing in front
flourishing his arm and saying something with a stern look the blood
stained smith stood beside him with a gloomy face a drone of voices was
audible through the closed window

is my carriage ready asked rostopchin stepping back from the window

it is your excellency replied the adjutant

rostopchin went again to the balcony door

but what do they want he asked the superintendent of police

your excellency they say they have got ready according to your
orders to go against the french and they shouted something about
treachery but it is a turbulent crowd your excellencyi hardly managed
to get away from it your excellency i venture to suggest

you may go i dont need you to tell me what to do exclaimed
rostopchin angrily

he stood by the balcony door looking at the crowd

this is what they have done with russia this is what they have done
with me thought he full of an irrepressible fury that welled up
within him against the someone to whom what was happening might be
attributed as often happens with passionate people he was mastered by
anger but was still seeking an object on which to vent it here is that
mob the dregs of the people he thought as he gazed at the crowd
this rabble they have roused by their folly they want a victim he
thought as he looked at the tall lad flourishing his arm and this
thought occurred to him just because he himself desired a victim
something on which to vent his rage

is the carriage ready he asked again

yes your excellency what are your orders about vereshchagin he is
waiting at the porch said the adjutant

ah exclaimed rostopchin as if struck by an unexpected recollection

and rapidly opening the door he went resolutely out onto the balcony
the talking instantly ceased hats and caps were doffed and all eyes
were raised to the count

good morning lads said the count briskly and loudly thank you for
coming ill come out to you in a moment but we must first settle with
the villain we must punish the villain who has caused the ruin of
moscow wait for me

and the count stepped as briskly back into the room and slammed the door
behind him

a murmur of approbation and satisfaction ran through the crowd hell
settle with all the villains youll see and you said the french
hell show you what law is the mob were saying as if reproving one
another for their lack of confidence

a few minutes later an officer came hurriedly out of the front door
gave an order and the dragoons formed up in line the crowd moved
eagerly from the balcony toward the porch rostopchin coming out there
with quick angry steps looked hastily around as if seeking someone

where is he he inquired and as he spoke he saw a young man coming
round the corner of the house between two dragoons he had a long thin
neck and his head that had been half shaved was again covered by
short hair this young man was dressed in a threadbare blue cloth coat
lined with fox fur that had once been smart and dirty hempen convict
trousers over which were pulled his thin dirty troddendown boots on
his thin weak legs were heavy chains which hampered his irresolute
movements

ah said rostopchin hurriedly turning away his eyes from the young
man in the furlined coat and pointing to the bottom step of the porch
put him there

the young man in his clattering chains stepped clumsily to the spot
indicated holding away with one finger the coat collar which chafed his
neck turned his long neck twice this way and that sighed and
submissively folded before him his thin hands unused to work

for several seconds while the young man was taking his place on the step
the silence continued only among the back rows of the people who were
all pressing toward the one spot could sighs groans and the shuffling
of feet be heard

while waiting for the young man to take his place on the step rostopchin
stood frowning and rubbing his face with his hand

lads said he with a metallic ring in his voice this man
vereshchagin is the scoundrel by whose doing moscow is perishing

the young man in the furlined coat stooping a little stood in a
submissive attitude his fingers clasped before him his emaciated young
face disfigured by the halfshaven head hung down hopelessly at the
counts first words he raised it slowly and looked up at him as if
wishing to say something or at least to meet his eye but rostopchin did
not look at him a vein in the young mans long thin neck swelled like a
cord and went blue behind the ear and suddenly his face flushed

all eyes were fixed on him he looked at the crowd and rendered more
hopeful by the expression he read on the faces there he smiled sadly
and timidly and lowering his head shifted his feet on the step

he has betrayed his tsar and his country he has gone over to
bonaparte he alone of all the russians has disgraced the russian name
he has caused moscow to perish said rostopchin in a sharp even voice
but suddenly he glanced down at vereshchagin who continued to stand in
the same submissive attitude as if inflamed by the sight he raised his
arm and addressed the people almost shouting

deal with him as you think fit i hand him over to you

the crowd remained silent and only pressed closer and closer to one
another to keep one another back to breathe in that stifling
atmosphere to be unable to stir and to await something unknown
uncomprehended and terrible was becoming unbearable those standing in
front who had seen and heard what had taken place before them all
stood with wideopen eyes and mouths straining with all their strength
and held back the crowd that was pushing behind them

beat him let the traitor perish and not disgrace the russian name
shouted rostopchin cut him down i command it

hearing not so much the words as the angry tone of rostopchins voice
the crowd moaned and heaved forward but again paused

count exclaimed the timid yet theatrical voice of vereshchagin in the
midst of the momentary silence that ensued count one god is above us
both he lifted his head and again the thick vein in his thin neck
filled with blood and the color rapidly came and went in his face

he did not finish what he wished to say

cut him down i command it shouted rostopchin suddenly growing
pale like vereshchagin

draw sabers cried the dragoon officer drawing his own

another still stronger wave flowed through the crowd and reaching the
front ranks carried it swaying to the very steps of the porch the tall
youth with a stony look on his face and rigid and uplifted arm stood
beside vereshchagin

saber him the dragoon officer almost whispered

and one of the soldiers his face all at once distorted with fury
struck vereshchagin on the head with the blunt side of his saber

ah cried vereshchagin in meek surprise looking round with a
frightened glance as if not understanding why this was done to him a
similar moan of surprise and horror ran through the crowd o lord
exclaimed a sorrowful voice

but after the exclamation of surprise that had escaped from vereshchagin
he uttered a plaintive cry of pain and that cry was fatal the barrier
of human feeling strained to the utmost that had held the crowd in
check suddenly broke the crime had begun and must now be completed the
plaintive moan of reproach was drowned by the threatening and angry roar
of the crowd like the seventh and last wave that shatters a ship that
last irresistible wave burst from the rear and reached the front ranks
carrying them off their feet and engulfing them all the dragoon was
about to repeat his blow vereshchagin with a cry of horror covering
his head with his hands rushed toward the crowd the tall youth
against whom he stumbled seized his thin neck with his hands and
yelling wildly fell with him under the feet of the pressing struggling
crowd

some beat and tore at vereshchagin others at the tall youth and the
screams of those that were being trampled on and of those who tried to
rescue the tall lad only increased the fury of the crowd it was a long
time before the dragoons could extricate the bleeding youth beaten
almost to death and for a long time despite the feverish haste with
which the mob tried to end the work that had been begun those who were
hitting throttling and tearing at vereshchagin were unable to kill
him for the crowd pressed from all sides swaying as one mass with them
in the center and rendering it impossible for them either to kill him or
let him go

hit him with an ax eh crushed traitor he sold christ
still alive tenacious serves him right torture serves a thief
right use the hatchet whatstill alive

only when the victim ceased to struggle and his cries changed to a long
drawn measured death rattle did the crowd around his prostrate
bleeding corpse begin rapidly to change places each one came up
glanced at what had been done and with horror reproach and
astonishment pushed back again

o lord the people are like wild beasts how could he be alive voices
in the crowd could be heard saying quite a young fellow too must
have been a merchants son what men and they say hes not the right
one how not the right one o lord and theres another has been
beaten toothey say hes nearly done for oh the people arent
they afraid of sinning said the same mob now looking with pained
distress at the dead body with its long thin halfsevered neck and its
livid face stained with blood and dust

a painstaking police officer considering the presence of a corpse in
his excellencys courtyard unseemly told the dragoons to take it away
two dragoons took it by its distorted legs and dragged it along the
ground the gory duststained halfshaven head with its long neck
trailed twisting along the ground the crowd shrank back from it

at the moment when vereshchagin fell and the crowd closed in with savage
yells and swayed about him rostopchin suddenly turned pale and instead
of going to the back entrance where his carriage awaited him went with
hurried steps and bent head not knowing where and why along the
passage leading to the rooms on the ground floor the counts face was
white and he could not control the feverish twitching of his lower jaw

this way your excellency where are you going this way
please said a trembling frightened voice behind him

count rostopchin was unable to reply and turning obediently went in
the direction indicated at the back entrance stood his caleche the
distant roar of the yelling crowd was audible even there he hastily
took his seat and told the coachman to drive him to his country house in
sokolniki

when they reached the myasnitski street and could no longer hear the
shouts of the mob the count began to repent he remembered with
dissatisfaction the agitation and fear he had betrayed before his
subordinates the mob is terribledisgusting he said to himself in
french they are like wolves whom nothing but flesh can appease
count one god is above us bothvereshchagins words suddenly
recurred to him and a disagreeable shiver ran down his back but this
was only a momentary feeling and count rostopchin smiled disdainfully at
himself i had other duties thought he the people had to be
appeased many other victims have perished and are perishing for the
public goodand he began thinking of his social duties to his family
and to the city entrusted to him and of himselfnot himself as theodore
vasilyevich rostopchin he fancied that theodore vasilyevich rostopchin
was sacrificing himself for the public good but himself as governor
the representative of authority and of the tsar had i been simply
theodore vasilyevich my course of action would have been quite
different but it was my duty to safeguard my life and dignity as
commanderinchief

lightly swaying on the flexible springs of his carriage and no longer
hearing the terrible sounds of the crowd rostopchin grew physically
calm and as always happens as soon as he became physically tranquil
his mind devised reasons why he should be mentally tranquil too the
thought which tranquillized rostopchin was not a new one since the
world began and men have killed one another no one has ever committed
such a crime against his fellow man without comforting himself with this
same idea this idea is le bien public the hypothetical welfare of
other people

to a man not swayed by passion that welfare is never certain but he who
commits such a crime always knows just where that welfare lies and
rostopchin now knew it

not only did his reason not reproach him for what he had done but he
even found cause for selfsatisfaction in having so successfully
contrived to avail himself of a convenient opportunity to punish a
criminal and at the same time pacify the mob

vereshchagin was tried and condemned to death thought rostopchin
though the senate had only condemned vereshchagin to hard labor he
was a traitor and a spy i could not let him go unpunished and so i have
killed two birds with one stone to appease the mob i gave them a victim
and at the same time punished a miscreant

having reached his country house and begun to give orders about domestic
arrangements the count grew quite tranquil

half an hour later he was driving with his fast horses across the
sokolniki field no longer thinking of what had occurred but considering
what was to come he was driving to the yauza bridge where he had heard
that kutúzov was count rostopchin was mentally preparing the angry and
stinging reproaches he meant to address to kutúzov for his deception he
would make that foxy old courtier feel that the responsibility for all
the calamities that would follow the abandonment of the city and the
ruin of russia as rostopchin regarded it would fall upon his doting
old head planning beforehand what he would say to kutúzov rostopchin
turned angrily in his caleche and gazed sternly from side to side

the sokolniki field was deserted only at the end of it in front of the
almshouse and the lunatic asylum could be seen some people in white and
others like them walking singly across the field shouting and
gesticulating

one of these was running to cross the path of count rostopchins
carriage and the count himself his coachman and his dragoons looked
with vague horror and curiosity at these released lunatics and
especially at the one running toward them

swaying from side to side on his long thin legs in his fluttering
dressing gown this lunatic was running impetuously his gaze fixed on
rostopchin shouting something in a hoarse voice and making signs to him
to stop the lunatics solemn gloomy face was thin and yellow with its
beard growing in uneven tufts his black agate pupils with saffron
yellow whites moved restlessly near the lower eyelids

stop pull up i tell you he cried in a piercing voice and again
shouted something breathlessly with emphatic intonations and gestures

coming abreast of the caleche he ran beside it

thrice have they slain me thrice have i risen from the dead they
stoned me crucified me i shall rise shall rise shall rise
they have torn my body the kingdom of god will be overthrown thrice
will i overthrow it and thrice reestablish it he cried raising his
voice higher and higher

count rostopchin suddenly grew pale as he had done when the crowd closed
in on vereshchagin he turned away go fas faster he cried in a
trembling voice to his coachman the caleche flew over the ground as
fast as the horses could draw it but for a long time count rostopchin
still heard the insane despairing screams growing fainter in the
distance while his eyes saw nothing but the astonished frightened
bloodstained face of the traitor in the furlined coat

recent as that mental picture was rostopchin already felt that it had
cut deep into his heart and drawn blood even now he felt clearly that
the gory trace of that recollection would not pass with time but that
the terrible memory would on the contrary dwell in his heart ever more
cruelly and painfully to the end of his life he seemed still to hear
the sound of his own words cut him down i command it

why did i utter those words it was by some accident i said them i
need not have said them he thought and then nothing would have
happened he saw the frightened and then infuriated face of the dragoon
who dealt the blow the look of silent timid reproach that boy in the
furlined coat had turned upon him but i did not do it for my own
sake i was bound to act that way the mob the traitor the public
welfare thought he

troops were still crowding at the yauza bridge it was hot kutúzov
dejected and frowning sat on a bench by the bridge toying with his whip
in the sand when a caleche dashed up noisily a man in a generals
uniform with plumes in his hat went up to kutúzov and said something in
french it was count rostopchin he told kutúzov that he had come
because moscow the capital was no more and only the army remained

things would have been different if your serene highness had not told
me that you would not abandon moscow without another battle all this
would not have happened he said

kutúzov looked at rostopchin as if not grasping what was said to him
he was trying to read something peculiar written at that moment on the
face of the man addressing him rostopchin grew confused and became
silent kutúzov slightly shook his head and not taking his penetrating
gaze from rostopchins face muttered softly

no i shall not give up moscow without a battle

whether kutúzov was thinking of something entirely different when he
spoke those words or uttered them purposely knowing them to be
meaningless at any rate rostopchin made no reply and hastily left him
and strange to say the governor of moscow the proud count rostopchin
took up a cossack whip and went to the bridge where he began with shouts
to drive on the carts that blocked the way





chapter xxvi

toward four oclock in the afternoon murats troops were entering
moscow in front rode a detachment of wurttemberg hussars and behind
them rode the king of naples himself accompanied by a numerous suite

about the middle of the arbat street near the church of the miraculous
icon of st nicholas murat halted to await news from the advanced
detachment as to the condition in which they had found the citadel le
kremlin

around murat gathered a group of those who had remained in moscow they
all stared in timid bewilderment at the strange longhaired commander
dressed up in feathers and gold

is that their tsar himself hes not bad low voices could be heard
saying

an interpreter rode up to the group

take off your cap your caps these words went from one to another
in the crowd the interpreter addressed an old porter and asked if it
was far to the kremlin the porter listening in perplexity to the
unfamiliar polish accent and not realizing that the interpreter was
speaking russian did not understand what was being said to him and
slipped behind the others

murat approached the interpreter and told him to ask where the russian
army was one of the russians understood what was asked and several
voices at once began answering the interpreter a french officer
returning from the advanced detachment rode up to murat and reported
that the gates of the citadel had been barricaded and that there was
probably an ambuscade there

good said murat and turning to one of the gentlemen in his suite
ordered four light guns to be moved forward to fire at the gates

the guns emerged at a trot from the column following murat and advanced
up the arbat when they reached the end of the vozdvizhenka street they
halted and drew in the square several french officers superintended the
placing of the guns and looked at the kremlin through field glasses

the bells in the kremlin were ringing for vespers and this sound
troubled the french they imagined it to be a call to arms a few
infantrymen ran to the kutafyev gate beams and wooden screens had been
put there and two musket shots rang out from under the gate as soon as
an officer and men began to run toward it a general who was standing by
the guns shouted some words of command to the officer and the latter
ran back again with his men

the sound of three more shots came from the gate

one shot struck a french soldiers foot and from behind the screens
came the strange sound of a few voices shouting instantly as at a word
of command the expression of cheerful serenity on the faces of the
french general officers and men changed to one of determined
concentrated readiness for strife and suffering to all of them from the
marshal to the least soldier that place was not the vozdvizhenka
mokhavaya or kutafyev street nor the troitsa gate places familiar in
moscow but a new battlefield which would probably prove sanguinary
and all made ready for that battle the cries from the gates ceased the
guns were advanced the artillerymen blew the ash off their linstocks
and an officer gave the word fire this was followed by two whistling
sounds of canister shot one after another the shot rattled against the
stone of the gate and upon the wooden beams and screens and two
wavering clouds of smoke rose over the square

a few instants after the echo of the reports resounding over the stone
built kremlin had died away the french heard a strange sound above their
head thousands of crows rose above the walls and circled in the air
cawing and noisily flapping their wings together with that sound came a
solitary human cry from the gateway and amid the smoke appeared the
figure of a bareheaded man in a peasants coat he grasped a musket and
took aim at the french fire repeated the officer once more and the
reports of a musket and of two cannon shots were heard simultaneously
the gate was again hidden by smoke

nothing more stirred behind the screens and the french infantry soldiers
and officers advanced to the gate in the gateway lay three wounded and
four dead two men in peasant coats ran away at the foot of the wall
toward the znamenka

clear that away said the officer pointing to the beams and the
corpses and the french soldiers after dispatching the wounded threw
the corpses over the parapet

who these men were nobody knew clear that away was all that was said
of them and they were thrown over the parapet and removed later on that
they might not stink thiers alone dedicates a few eloquent lines to
their memory these wretches had occupied the sacred citadel having
supplied themselves with guns from the arsenal and fired the
wretches at the french some of them were sabered and the kremlin was
purged of their presence

murat was informed that the way had been cleared the french entered the
gates and began pitching their camp in the senate square out of the
windows of the senate house the soldiers threw chairs into the square
for fuel and kindled fires there

other detachments passed through the kremlin and encamped along the
moroseyka the lubyanka and pokrovka streets others quartered
themselves along the vozdvizhenka the nikolski and the tverskoy
streets no masters of the houses being found anywhere the french were
not billeted on the inhabitants as is usual in towns but lived in it as
in a camp

though tattered hungry worn out and reduced to a third of their
original number the french entered moscow in good marching order it
was a weary and famished but still a fighting and menacing army but it
remained an army only until its soldiers had dispersed into their
different lodgings as soon as the men of the various regiments began to
disperse among the wealthy and deserted houses the army was lost
forever and there came into being something nondescript neither
citizens nor soldiers but what are known as marauders when five weeks
later these same men left moscow they no longer formed an army they
were a mob of marauders each carrying a quantity of articles which
seemed to him valuable or useful the aim of each man when he left
moscow was no longer as it had been to conquer but merely to keep
what he had acquired like a monkey which puts its paw into the narrow
neck of a jug and having seized a handful of nuts will not open its
fist for fear of losing what it holds and therefore perishes the
french when they left moscow had inevitably to perish because they
carried their loot with them yet to abandon what they had stolen was as
impossible for them as it is for the monkey to open its paw and let go
of its nuts ten minutes after each regiment had entered a moscow
district not a soldier or officer was left men in military uniforms
and hessian boots could be seen through the windows laughing and
walking through the rooms in cellars and storerooms similar men were
busy among the provisions and in the yards unlocking or breaking open
coach house and stable doors lighting fires in kitchens and kneading
and baking bread with rolledup sleeves and cooking or frightening
amusing or caressing women and children there were many such men both
in the shops and housesbut there was no army

order after order was issued by the french commanders that day
forbidding the men to disperse about the town sternly forbidding any
violence to the inhabitants or any looting and announcing a roll call
for that very evening but despite all these measures the men who had
till then constituted an army flowed all over the wealthy deserted
city with its comforts and plentiful supplies as a hungry herd of
cattle keeps well together when crossing a barren field but gets out of
hand and at once disperses uncontrollably as soon as it reaches rich
pastures so did the army disperse all over the wealthy city

no residents were left in moscow and the soldierslike water
percolating through sandspread irresistibly through the city in all
directions from the kremlin into which they had first marched the
cavalry on entering a merchants house that had been abandoned and
finding there stabling more than sufficient for their horses went on
all the same to the next house which seemed to them better many of
them appropriated several houses chalked their names on them and
quarreled and even fought with other companies for them before they had
had time to secure quarters the soldiers ran out into the streets to see
the city and hearing that everything had been abandoned rushed to
places where valuables were to be had for the taking the officers
followed to check the soldiers and were involuntarily drawn into doing
the same in carriage row carriages had been left in the shops and
generals flocked there to select caleches and coaches for themselves
the few inhabitants who had remained invited commanding officers to
their houses hoping thereby to secure themselves from being plundered
there were masses of wealth and there seemed no end to it all around
the quarters occupied by the french were other regions still unexplored
and unoccupied where they thought yet greater riches might be found
and moscow engulfed the army ever deeper and deeper when water is
spilled on dry ground both the dry ground and the water disappear and
mud results and in the same way the entry of the famished army into the
rich and deserted city resulted in fires and looting and the destruction
of both the army and the wealthy city

the french attributed the fire of moscow au patriotisme feroce de
rostopchine  the russians to the barbarity of the french in reality
however it was not and could not be possible to explain the burning
of moscow by making any individual or any group of people responsible
for it moscow was burned because it found itself in a position in which
any town built of wood was bound to burn quite apart from whether it
had or had not a hundred and thirty inferior fire engines deserted
moscow had to burn as inevitably as a heap of shavings has to burn on
which sparks continually fall for several days a town built of wood
where scarcely a day passes without conflagrations when the house owners
are in residence and a police force is present cannot help burning when
its inhabitants have left it and it is occupied by soldiers who smoke
pipes make campfires of the senate chairs in the senate square and
cook themselves meals twice a day in peacetime it is only necessary to
billet troops in the villages of any district and the number of fires in
that district immediately increases how much then must the probability
of fire be increased in an abandoned wooden town where foreign troops
are quartered le patriotisme feroce de rostopchine and the barbarity
of the french were not to blame in the matter moscow was set on fire by
the soldiers pipes kitchens and campfires and by the carelessness of
enemy soldiers occupying houses they did not own even if there was any
arson which is very doubtful for no one had any reason to burn the
housesin any case a troublesome and dangerous thing to do arson
cannot be regarded as the cause for the same thing would have happened
without any incendiarism

 to rostopchins ferocious patriotism

however tempting it might be for the french to blame rostopchins
ferocity and for russians to blame the scoundrel bonaparte or later on
to place an heroic torch in the hands of their own people it is
impossible not to see that there could be no such direct cause of the
fire for moscow had to burn as every village factory or house must
burn which is left by its owners and in which strangers are allowed to
live and cook their porridge moscow was burned by its inhabitants it
is true but by those who had abandoned it and not by those who remained
in it moscow when occupied by the enemy did not remain intact like
berlin vienna and other towns simply because its inhabitants
abandoned it and did not welcome the french with bread and salt nor
bring them the keys of the city





chapter xxvii

the absorption of the french by moscow radiating starwise as it did
only reached the quarter where pierre was staying by the evening of the
second of september

after the last two days spent in solitude and unusual circumstances
pierre was in a state bordering on insanity he was completely obsessed
by one persistent thought he did not know how or when this thought had
taken such possession of him but he remembered nothing of the past
understood nothing of the present and all he saw and heard appeared to
him like a dream

he had left home only to escape the intricate tangle of lifes demands
that enmeshed him and which in his present condition he was unable to
unravel he had gone to joseph alexeevichs house on the plea of
sorting the deceaseds books and papers only in search of rest from
lifes turmoil for in his mind the memory of joseph alexeevich was
connected with a world of eternal solemn and calm thoughts quite
contrary to the restless confusion into which he felt himself being
drawn he sought a quiet refuge and in joseph alexeevichs study he
really found it when he sat with his elbows on the dusty writing table
in the deathlike stillness of the study calm and significant memories
of the last few days rose one after another in his imagination
particularly of the battle of borodino and of that vague sense of his
own insignificance and insincerity compared with the truth simplicity
and strength of the class of men he mentally classed as they when
gerasim roused him from his reverie the idea occurred to him of taking
part in the popular defense of moscow which he knew was projected and
with that object he had asked gerasim to get him a peasants coat and a
pistol confiding to him his intentions of remaining in joseph
alexeevichs house and keeping his name secret then during the first
day spent in inaction and solitude he tried several times to fix his
attention on the masonic manuscripts but was unable to do so the idea
that had previously occurred to him of the cabalistic significance of
his name in connection with bonapartes more than once vaguely presented
itself but the idea that he lrusse besuhof was destined to set a
limit to the power of the beast was as yet only one of the fancies that
often passed through his mind and left no trace behind

when having bought the coat merely with the object of taking part among
the people in the defense of moscow pierre had met the rostóvs and
natásha had said to him are you remaining in moscow how splendid
the thought flashed into his mind that it really would be a good thing
even if moscow were taken for him to remain there and do what he was
predestined to do

next day with the sole idea of not sparing himself and not lagging in
any way behind them pierre went to the three hills gate but when he
returned to the house convinced that moscow would not be defended he
suddenly felt that what before had seemed to him merely a possibility
had now become absolutely necessary and inevitable he must remain in
moscow concealing his name and must meet napoleon and kill him and
either perish or put an end to the misery of all europewhich it seemed
to him was solely due to napoleon

pierre knew all the details of the attempt on bonapartes life in
by a german student in vienna and knew that the student had been shot
and the risk to which he would expose his life by carrying out his
design excited him still more

two equally strong feelings drew pierre irresistibly to this purpose
the first was a feeling of the necessity of sacrifice and suffering in
view of the common calamity the same feeling that had caused him to go
to mozhaysk on the twentyfifth and to make his way to the very thick of
the battle and had now caused him to run away from his home and in
place of the luxury and comfort to which he was accustomed to sleep on
a hard sofa without undressing and eat the same food as gerasim the
other was that vague and quite russian feeling of contempt for
everything conventional artificial and humanfor everything the
majority of men regard as the greatest good in the world pierre had
first experienced this strange and fascinating feeling at the sloboda
palace when he had suddenly felt that wealth power and lifeall that
men so painstakingly acquire and guardif it has any worth has so only
by reason of the joy with which it can all be renounced

it was the feeling that induces a volunteer recruit to spend his last
penny on drink and a drunken man to smash mirrors or glasses for no
apparent reason and knowing that it will cost him all the money he
possesses the feeling which causes a man to perform actions which from
an ordinary point of view are insane to test as it were his personal
power and strength affirming the existence of a higher nonhuman
criterion of life

from the very day pierre had experienced this feeling for the first time
at the sloboda palace he had been continuously under its influence but
only now found full satisfaction for it moreover at this moment pierre
was supported in his design and prevented from renouncing it by what he
had already done in that direction if he were now to leave moscow like
everyone else his flight from home the peasant coat the pistol and
his announcement to the rostóvs that he would remain in moscow would all
become not merely meaningless but contemptible and ridiculous and to
this pierre was very sensitive

pierres physical condition as is always the case corresponded to his
mental state the unaccustomed coarse food the vodka he drank during
those days the absence of wine and cigars his dirty unchanged linen
two almost sleepless nights passed on a short sofa without beddingall
this kept him in a state of excitement bordering on insanity

it was two oclock in the afternoon the french had already entered
moscow pierre knew this but instead of acting he only thought about
his undertaking going over its minutest details in his mind in his
fancy he did not clearly picture to himself either the striking of the
blow or the death of napoleon but with extraordinary vividness and
melancholy enjoyment imagined his own destruction and heroic endurance

yes alone for the sake of all i must do it or perish he thought
yes i will approach and then suddenly with pistol or dagger but
that is all the same it is not i but the hand of providence that
punishes thee i shall say thought he imagining what he would say
when killing napoleon well then take me and execute me he went on
speaking to himself and bowing his head with a sad but firm expression

while pierre standing in the middle of the room was talking to himself
in this way the study door opened and on the threshold appeared the
figure of makar alexeevich always so timid before but now quite
transformed

his dressing gown was unfastened his face red and distorted he was
obviously drunk on seeing pierre he grew confused at first but
noticing embarrassment on pierres face immediately grew bold and
staggering on his thin legs advanced into the middle of the room

theyre frightened he said confidentially in a hoarse voice i say i
wont surrender i say am i not right sir

he paused and then suddenly seeing the pistol on the table seized it
with unexpected rapidity and ran out into the corridor

gerasim and the porter who had followed makar alexeevich stopped him
in the vestibule and tried to take the pistol from him pierre coming
out into the corridor looked with pity and repulsion at the halfcrazy
old man makar alexeevich frowning with exertion held on to the pistol
and screamed hoarsely evidently with some heroic fancy in his head

to arms board them no you shant get it he yelled

that will do please that will do have the goodnessplease sir to
let go please sir pleaded gerasim trying carefully to steer makar
alexeevich by the elbows back to the door

who are you bonaparte shouted makar alexeevich

thats not right sir come to your room please and rest allow me to
have the pistol

be off thou base slave touch me not see this shouted makar
alexeevich brandishing the pistol board them

catch hold whispered gerasim to the porter

they seized makar alexeevich by the arms and dragged him to the door

the vestibule was filled with the discordant sounds of a struggle and of
a tipsy hoarse voice

suddenly a fresh sound a piercing feminine scream reverberated from
the porch and the cook came running into the vestibule

its them gracious heavens o lord four of them horsemen she
cried

gerasim and the porter let makar alexeevich go and in the now silent
corridor the sound of several hands knocking at the front door could be
heard





chapter xxviii

pierre having decided that until he had carried out his design he would
disclose neither his identity nor his knowledge of french stood at the
halfopen door of the corridor intending to conceal himself as soon as
the french entered but the french entered and still pierre did not
retirean irresistible curiosity kept him there

there were two of them one was an officera tall soldierly handsome
manthe other evidently a private or an orderly sunburned short and
thin with sunken cheeks and a dull expression the officer walked in
front leaning on a stick and slightly limping when he had advanced a
few steps he stopped having apparently decided that these were good
quarters turned round to the soldiers standing at the entrance and in
a loud voice of command ordered them to put up the horses having done
that the officer lifting his elbow with a smart gesture stroked his
mustache and lightly touched his hat

bonjour la compagnie  said he gaily smiling and looking about him

 good day everybody

no one gave any reply

vous etes le bourgeois  the officer asked gerasim

 are you the master here

gerasim gazed at the officer with an alarmed and inquiring look

quartier quartier logement said the officer looking down at the
little man with a condescending and goodnatured smile les francais
sont de bons enfants que diable voyons ne nous fachons pas mon
vieux  added he clapping the scared and silent gerasim on the
shoulder well does no one speak french in this establishment he
asked again in french looking around and meeting pierres eyes pierre
moved away from the door

 quarters quarters lodgings the french are good fellows what the
devil there dont let us be cross old fellow

again the officer turned to gerasim and asked him to show him the rooms
in the house

master not heredont understand me you said gerasim trying
to render his words more comprehensible by contorting them

still smiling the french officer spread out his hands before gerasims
nose intimating that he did not understand him either and moved
limping to the door at which pierre was standing pierre wished to go
away and conceal himself but at that moment he saw makar alexeevich
appearing at the open kitchen door with the pistol in his hand with a
madmans cunning makar alexeevich eyed the frenchman raised his
pistol and took aim

board them yelled the tipsy man trying to press the trigger hearing
the yell the officer turned round and at the same moment pierre threw
himself on the drunkard just when pierre snatched at and struck up the
pistol makar alexeevich at last got his fingers on the trigger there
was a deafening report and all were enveloped in a cloud of smoke the
frenchman turned pale and rushed to the door

forgetting his intention of concealing his knowledge of french pierre
snatching away the pistol and throwing it down ran up to the officer
and addressed him in french

you are not wounded he asked

i think not answered the frenchman feeling himself over but i have
had a lucky escape this time he added pointing to the damaged plaster
of the wall who is that man said he looking sternly at pierre

oh i am really in despair at what has occurred said pierre rapidly
quite forgetting the part he had intended to play he is an unfortunate
madman who did not know what he was doing

the officer went up to makar alexeevich and took him by the collar

makar alexeevich was standing with parted lips swaying as if about to
fall asleep as he leaned against the wall

brigand you shall pay for this said the frenchman letting go of
him we french are merciful after victory but we do not pardon
traitors he added with a look of gloomy dignity and a fine energetic
gesture

pierre continued in french to persuade the officer not to hold that
drunken imbecile to account the frenchman listened in silence with the
same gloomy expression but suddenly turned to pierre with a smile for
a few seconds he looked at him in silence his handsome face assumed a
melodramatically gentle expression and he held out his hand

you have saved my life you are french said he

for a frenchman that deduction was indubitable only a frenchman could
perform a great deed and to save his lifethe life of m ramballe
captain of the th light regimentwas undoubtedly a very great deed

but however indubitable that conclusion and the officers conviction
based upon it pierre felt it necessary to disillusion him

i am russian he said quickly

tut tut tut tell that to others said the officer waving his
finger before his nose and smiling you shall tell me all about that
presently i am delighted to meet a compatriot well and what are we to
do with this man he added addressing himself to pierre as to a
brother

even if pierre were not a frenchman having once received that loftiest
of human appellations he could not renounce it said the officers look
and tone in reply to his last question pierre again explained who makar
alexeevich was and how just before their arrival that drunken imbecile
had seized the loaded pistol which they had not had time to recover from
him and begged the officer to let the deed go unpunished

the frenchman expanded his chest and made a majestic gesture with his
arm

you have saved my life you are french you ask his pardon i grant it
you lead that man away said he quickly and energetically and taking
the arm of pierre whom he had promoted to be a frenchman for saving his
life he went with him into the room

the soldiers in the yard hearing the shot came into the passage asking
what had happened and expressed their readiness to punish the culprits
but the officer sternly checked them

you will be called in when you are wanted he said

the soldiers went out again and the orderly who had meanwhile had time
to visit the kitchen came up to his officer

captain there is soup and a leg of mutton in the kitchen said he
shall i serve them up

yes and some wine answered the captain





chapter xxix

when the french officer went into the room with pierre the latter again
thought it his duty to assure him that he was not french and wished to
go away but the officer would not hear of it he was so very polite
amiable goodnatured and genuinely grateful to pierre for saving his
life that pierre had not the heart to refuse and sat down with him in
the parlorthe first room they entered to pierres assurances that he
was not a frenchman the captain evidently not understanding how anyone
could decline so flattering an appellation shrugged his shoulders and
said that if pierre absolutely insisted on passing for a russian let it
be so but for all that he would be forever bound to pierre by gratitude
for saving his life

had this man been endowed with the slightest capacity for perceiving the
feelings of others and had he at all understood what pierres feelings
were the latter would probably have left him but the mans animated
obtuseness to everything other than himself disarmed pierre

a frenchman or a russian prince incognito said the officer looking
at pierres fine though dirty linen and at the ring on his finger i
owe my life to you and offer you my friendship a frenchman never
forgets either an insult or a service i offer you my friendship that
is all i can say

there was so much good nature and nobility in the french sense of the
word in the officers voice in the expression of his face and in his
gestures that pierre unconsciously smiling in response to the
frenchmans smile pressed the hand held out to him

captain ramballe of the th light regiment chevalier of the legion
of honor for the affair on the seventh of september he introduced
himself a selfsatisfied irrepressible smile puckering his lips under
his mustache will you now be so good as to tell me with whom i have
the honor of conversing so pleasantly instead of being in the ambulance
with that maniacs bullet in my body

pierre replied that he could not tell him his name and blushing began
to try to invent a name and to say something about his reason for
concealing it but the frenchman hastily interrupted him

oh please said he i understand your reasons you are an officer
a superior officer perhaps you have borne arms against us thats not
my business i owe you my life that is enough for me i am quite at
your service you belong to the gentry he concluded with a shade of
inquiry in his tone pierre bent his head your baptismal name if you
please that is all i ask monsieur pierre you say thats all i
want to know

when the mutton and an omelet had been served and a samovar and vodka
brought with some wine which the french had taken from a russian cellar
and brought with them ramballe invited pierre to share his dinner and
himself began to eat greedily and quickly like a healthy and hungry man
munching his food rapidly with his strong teeth continually smacking
his lips and repeatingexcellent delicious his face grew red and
was covered with perspiration pierre was hungry and shared the dinner
with pleasure morel the orderly brought some hot water in a saucepan
and placed a bottle of claret in it he also brought a bottle of kvass
taken from the kitchen for them to try that beverage was already known
to the french and had been given a special name they called it limonade
de cochon pigs lemonade and morel spoke well of the limonade de
cochon he had found in the kitchen but as the captain had the wine they
had taken while passing through moscow he left the kvass to morel and
applied himself to the bottle of bordeaux he wrapped the bottle up to
its neck in a table napkin and poured out wine for himself and for
pierre the satisfaction of his hunger and the wine rendered the captain
still more lively and he chatted incessantly all through dinner

yes my dear monsieur pierre i owe you a fine votive candle for saving
me from that maniac you see i have bullets enough in my body
already here is one i got at wagram he touched his side and a
second at smolenskhe showed a scar on his cheekand this leg which as
you see does not want to march i got that on the seventh at the great
battle of la moskowa sacre dieu it was splendid that deluge of fire
was worth seeing it was a tough job you set us there my word you may
be proud of it and on my honor in spite of the cough i caught there i
should be ready to begin again i pity those who did not see it

i was there said pierre

bah really so much the better you are certainly brave foes the
great redoubt held out well by my pipe continued the frenchman and
you made us pay dear for it i was at it three timessure as i sit here
three times we reached the guns and three times we were thrown back like
cardboard figures oh it was beautiful monsieur pierre your
grenadiers were splendid by heaven i saw them close up their ranks six
times in succession and march as if on parade fine fellows our king of
naples who knows whats what cried bravo ha ha so you are one of
us soldiers he added smiling after a momentary pause so much the
better so much the better monsieur pierre terrible in battle
gallant with the fair he winked and smiled thats what the
french are monsieur pierre arent they

the captain was so naïvely and goodhumoredly gay so real and so
pleased with himself that pierre almost winked back as he looked merrily
at him probably the word gallant turned the captains thoughts to the
state of moscow

apropos tell me please is it true that the women have all left
moscow what a queer idea what had they to be afraid of

would not the french ladies leave paris if the russians entered it
asked pierre

ha ha ha the frenchman emitted a merry sanguine chuckle patting
pierre on the shoulder what a thing to say he exclaimed paris
but paris paris

paristhe capital of the world pierre finished his remark for him

the captain looked at pierre he had a habit of stopping short in the
middle of his talk and gazing intently with his laughing kindly eyes

well if you hadnt told me you were russian i should have wagered
that you were parisian you have that i dont know what that and
having uttered this compliment he again gazed at him in silence

i have been in paris i spent years there said pierre

oh yes one sees that plainly paris a man who doesnt know paris
is a savage you can tell a parisian two leagues off paris is talma la
duchenois potier the sorbonne the boulevards and noticing that his
conclusion was weaker than what had gone before he added quickly
there is only one paris in the world you have been to paris and have
remained russian well i dont esteem you the less for it

under the influence of the wine he had drunk and after the days he had
spent alone with his depressing thoughts pierre involuntarily enjoyed
talking with this cheerful and goodnatured man

to return to your ladiesi hear they are lovely what a wretched idea
to go and bury themselves in the steppes when the french army is in
moscow what a chance those girls have missed your peasants nowthats
another thing but you civilized people you ought to know us better
than that we took vienna berlin madrid naples rome warsaw all the
worlds capitals we are feared but we are loved we are nice to
know and then the emperor he began but pierre interrupted him

the emperor pierre repeated and his face suddenly became sad and
embarrassed is the emperor

the emperor he is generosity mercy justice order geniusthats
what the emperor is it is i ramballe who tell you so i assure you
i was his enemy eight years ago my father was an emigrant count but
that man has vanquished me he has taken hold of me i could not resist
the sight of the grandeur and glory with which he has covered france
when i understood what he wantedwhen i saw that he was preparing a bed
of laurels for us you know i said to myself that is a monarch and
i devoted myself to him so there oh yes mon cher he is the greatest
man of the ages past or future

is he in moscow pierre stammered with a guilty look

the frenchman looked at his guilty face and smiled

no he will make his entry tomorrow he replied and continued his
talk

their conversation was interrupted by the cries of several voices at the
gate and by morel who came to say that some wurttemberg hussars had
come and wanted to put up their horses in the yard where the captains
horses were this difficulty had arisen chiefly because the hussars did
not understand what was said to them in french

the captain had their senior sergeant called in and in a stern voice
asked him to what regiment he belonged who was his commanding officer
and by what right he allowed himself to claim quarters that were already
occupied the german who knew little french answered the two first
questions by giving the names of his regiment and of his commanding
officer but in reply to the third question which he did not understand
said introducing broken french into his own german that he was the
quartermaster of the regiment and his commander had ordered him to
occupy all the houses one after another pierre who knew german
translated what the german said to the captain and gave the captains
reply to the wurttemberg hussar in german when he had understood what
was said to him the german submitted and took his men elsewhere the
captain went out into the porch and gave some orders in a loud voice

when he returned to the room pierre was sitting in the same place as
before with his head in his hands his face expressed suffering he
really was suffering at that moment when the captain went out and he
was left alone suddenly he came to himself and realized the position he
was in it was not that moscow had been taken or that the happy
conquerors were masters in it and were patronizing him painful as that
was it was not that which tormented pierre at the moment he was
tormented by the consciousness of his own weakness the few glasses of
wine he had drunk and the conversation with this goodnatured man had
destroyed the mood of concentrated gloom in which he had spent the last
few days and which was essential for the execution of his design the
pistol dagger and peasant coat were ready napoleon was to enter the
town next day pierre still considered that it would be a useful and
worthy action to slay the evildoer but now he felt that he would not do
it he did not know why but he felt a foreboding that he would not
carry out his intention he struggled against the confession of his
weakness but dimly felt that he could not overcome it and that his
former gloomy frame of mind concerning vengeance killing and self
sacrifice had been dispersed like dust by contact with the first man he
met

the captain returned to the room limping slightly and whistling a tune

the frenchmans chatter which had previously amused pierre now repelled
him the tune he was whistling his gait and the gesture with which he
twirled his mustache all now seemed offensive i will go away
immediately i wont say another word to him thought pierre he
thought this but still sat in the same place a strange feeling of
weakness tied him to the spot he wished to get up and go away but
could not do so

the captain on the other hand seemed very cheerful he paced up and
down the room twice his eyes shone and his mustache twitched as if he
were smiling to himself at some amusing thought

the colonel of those wurttembergers is delightful he suddenly said
hes a german but a nice fellow all the same but hes a german
he sat down facing pierre by the way you know german then

pierre looked at him in silence

what is the german for shelter

shelter pierre repeated the german for shelter is unterkunft

how do you say it the captain asked quickly and doubtfully

unterkunft pierre repeated

onterkoff said the captain and looked at pierre for some seconds with
laughing eyes these germans are firstrate fools dont you think so
monsieur pierre he concluded

well lets have another bottle of this moscow bordeaux shall we
morel will warm us up another little bottle morel he called out
gaily

morel brought candles and a bottle of wine the captain looked at pierre
by the candlelight and was evidently struck by the troubled expression
on his companions face ramballe with genuine distress and sympathy in
his face went up to pierre and bent over him

there now were sad said he touching pierres hand have i upset
you no really have you anything against me he asked pierre
perhaps its the state of affairs

pierre did not answer but looked cordially into the frenchmans eyes
whose expression of sympathy was pleasing to him

honestly without speaking of what i owe you i feel friendship for
you can i do anything for you dispose of me it is for life and death
i say it with my hand on my heart said he striking his chest

thank you said pierre

the captain gazed intently at him as he had done when he learned that
shelter was unterkunft in german and his face suddenly brightened

well in that case i drink to our friendship he cried gaily filling
two glasses with wine

pierre took one of the glasses and emptied it ramballe emptied his too
again pressed pierres hand and leaned his elbows on the table in a
pensive attitude

yes my dear friend he began such is fortunes caprice who would
have said that i should be a soldier and a captain of dragoons in the
service of bonaparte as we used to call him yet here i am in moscow
with him i must tell you mon cher he continued in the sad and
measured tones of a man who intends to tell a long story that our name
is one of the most ancient in france

and with a frenchmans easy and naïve frankness the captain told pierre
the story of his ancestors his childhood youth and manhood and all
about his relations and his financial and family affairs ma pauvre
mere playing of course an important part in the story

but all that is only lifes setting the real thing is lovelove am i
not right monsieur pierre said he growing animated another glass

pierre again emptied his glass and poured himself out a third

oh women women and the captain looking with glistening eyes at
pierre began talking of love and of his love affairs

there were very many of these as one could easily believe looking at
the officers handsome selfsatisfied face and noting the eager
enthusiasm with which he spoke of women though all ramballes love
stories had the sensual character which frenchmen regard as the special
charm and poetry of love yet he told his story with such sincere
conviction that he alone had experienced and known all the charm of love
and he described women so alluringly that pierre listened to him with
curiosity

it was plain that lamour which the frenchman was so fond of was not
that low and simple kind that pierre had once felt for his wife nor was
it the romantic love stimulated by himself that he experienced for
natásha ramballe despised both these kinds of love equally the one he
considered the love of clodhoppers and the other the love of
simpletons lamour which the frenchman worshiped consisted
principally in the unnaturalness of his relation to the woman and in a
combination of incongruities giving the chief charm to the feeling

thus the captain touchingly recounted the story of his love for a
fascinating marquise of thirtyfive and at the same time for a charming
innocent child of seventeen daughter of the bewitching marquise the
conflict of magnanimity between the mother and the daughter ending in
the mothers sacrificing herself and offering her daughter in marriage
to her lover even now agitated the captain though it was the memory of
a distant past then he recounted an episode in which the husband played
the part of the lover and hethe loverassumed the role of the husband
as well as several droll incidents from his recollections of germany
where shelter is called unterkunft and where the husbands eat
sauerkraut and the young girls are too blonde

finally the latest episode in poland still fresh in the captains
memory and which he narrated with rapid gestures and glowing face was
of how he had saved the life of a pole in general the saving of life
continually occurred in the captains stories and the pole had
entrusted to him his enchanting wife parisienne de coeur while himself
entering the french service the captain was happy the enchanting
polish lady wished to elope with him but prompted by magnanimity the
captain restored the wife to the husband saying as he did so i have
saved your life and i save your honor having repeated these words the
captain wiped his eyes and gave himself a shake as if driving away the
weakness which assailed him at this touching recollection

listening to the captains tales pierreas often happens late in the
evening and under the influence of winefollowed all that was told him
understood it all and at the same time followed a train of personal
memories which he knew not why suddenly arose in his mind while
listening to these love stories his own love for natásha unexpectedly
rose to his mind and going over the pictures of that love in his
imagination he mentally compared them with ramballes tales listening
to the story of the struggle between love and duty pierre saw before
his eyes every minutest detail of his last meeting with the object of
his love at the sukharev water tower at the time of that meeting it had
not produced an effect upon himhe had not even once recalled it but
now it seemed to him that that meeting had had in it something very
important and poetic

peter kirilovich come here we have recognized you he now seemed to
hear the words she had uttered and to see before him her eyes her
smile her traveling hood and a stray lock of her hair and there
seemed to him something pathetic and touching in all this

having finished his tale about the enchanting polish lady the captain
asked pierre if he had ever experienced a similar impulse to sacrifice
himself for love and a feeling of envy of the legitimate husband

challenged by this question pierre raised his head and felt a need to
express the thoughts that filled his mind he began to explain that he
understood love for a women somewhat differently he said that in all
his life he had loved and still loved only one woman and that she could
never be his

tiens said the captain

pierre then explained that he had loved this woman from his earliest
years but that he had not dared to think of her because she was too
young and because he had been an illegitimate son without a name
afterwards when he had received a name and wealth he dared not think of
her because he loved her too well placing her far above everything in
the world and especially therefore above himself

when he had reached this point pierre asked the captain whether he
understood that

the captain made a gesture signifying that even if he did not understand
it he begged pierre to continue

platonic love clouds he muttered

whether it was the wine he had drunk or an impulse of frankness or the
thought that this man did not and never would know any of those who
played a part in his story or whether it was all these things together
something loosened pierres tongue speaking thickly and with a faraway
look in his shining eyes he told the whole story of his life his
marriage natáshas love for his best friend her betrayal of him and
all his own simple relations with her urged on by ramballes questions
he also told what he had at first concealedhis own position and even
his name

more than anything else in pierres story the captain was impressed by
the fact that pierre was very rich had two mansions in moscow and that
he had abandoned everything and not left the city but remained there
concealing his name and station

when it was late at night they went out together into the street the
night was warm and light to the left of the house on the pokrovka a
fire glowedthe first of those that were beginning in moscow to the
right and high up in the sky was the sickle of the waning moon and
opposite to it hung that bright comet which was connected in pierres
heart with his love at the gate stood gerasim the cook and two
frenchmen their laughter and their mutually incomprehensible remarks in
two languages could be heard they were looking at the glow seen in the
town

there was nothing terrible in the one small distant fire in the immense
city

gazing at the high starry sky at the moon at the comet and at the
glow from the fire pierre experienced a joyful emotion there now how
good it is what more does one need thought he and suddenly
remembering his intention he grew dizzy and felt so faint that he leaned
against the fence to save himself from falling

without taking leave of his new friend pierre left the gate with
unsteady steps and returning to his room lay down on the sofa and
immediately fell asleep





chapter xxx

the glow of the first fire that began on the second of september was
watched from the various roads by the fugitive muscovites and by the
retreating troops with many different feelings

the rostóv party spent the night at mytishchi fourteen miles from
moscow they had started so late on the first of september the road had
been so blocked by vehicles and troops so many things had been
forgotten for which servants were sent back that they had decided to
spend that night at a place three miles out of moscow the next morning
they woke late and were again delayed so often that they only got as far
as great mytishchi at ten oclock that evening the rostóv family and
the wounded traveling with them were all distributed in the yards and
huts of that large village the rostóvs servants and coachmen and the
orderlies of the wounded officers after attending to their masters had
supper fed the horses and came out into the porches

in a neighboring hut lay raevskis adjutant with a fractured wrist the
awful pain he suffered made him moan incessantly and piteously and his
moaning sounded terrible in the darkness of the autumn night he had
spent the first night in the same yard as the rostóvs the countess said
she had been unable to close her eyes on account of his moaning and at
mytishchi she moved into a worse hut simply to be farther away from the
wounded man

in the darkness of the night one of the servants noticed above the high
body of a coach standing before the porch the small glow of another
fire one glow had long been visible and everybody knew that it was
little mytishchi burningset on fire by mamonovs cossacks

but look here brothers theres another fire remarked an orderly

all turned their attention to the glow

but they told us little mytishchi had been set on fire by mamonovs
cossacks

but thats not mytishchi its farther away

look it must be in moscow

two of the gazers went round to the other side of the coach and sat down
on its steps

its more to the left why little mytishchi is over there and this is
right on the other side

several men joined the first two

see how its flaring said one thats a fire in moscow either in
the sushchevski or the rogozhski quarter

no one replied to this remark and for some time they all gazed silently
at the spreading flames of the second fire in the distance

old daniel terentich the counts valet as he was called came up to
the group and shouted at mishka

what are you staring at you goodfornothing the count will be
calling and theres nobody there go and gather the clothes together

i only ran out to get some water said mishka

but what do you think daniel terentich doesnt it look as if that
glow were in moscow remarked one of the footmen

daniel terentich made no reply and again for a long time they were all
silent the glow spread rising and falling farther and farther still

god have mercy its windy and dry said another voice

just look see what its doing now o lord you can even see the crows
flying lord have mercy on us sinners

theyll put it out no fear

whos to put it out daniel terentich who had hitherto been silent
was heard to say his voice was calm and deliberate moscow it is
brothers said he mother moscow the white his voice faltered
and he gave way to an old mans sob

and it was as if they had all only waited for this to realize the
significance for them of the glow they were watching sighs were heard
words of prayer and the sobbing of the counts old valet





chapter xxxi

the valet returning to the cottage informed the count that moscow was
burning the count donned his dressing gown and went out to look sónya
and madame schoss who had not yet undressed went out with him only
natásha and the countess remained in the room pétya was no longer with
the family he had gone on with his regiment which was making for
troitsa

the countess on hearing that moscow was on fire began to cry natásha
pale with a fixed look was sitting on the bench under the icons just
where she had sat down on arriving and paid no attention to her fathers
words she was listening to the ceaseless moaning of the adjutant three
houses off

oh how terrible said sónya returning from the yard chilled and
frightened i believe the whole of moscow will burn theres an awful
glow natásha do look you can see it from the window she said to her
cousin evidently wishing to distract her mind

but natásha looked at her as if not understanding what was said to her
and again fixed her eyes on the corner of the stove she had been in
this condition of stupor since the morning when sónya to the surprise
and annoyance of the countess had for some unaccountable reason found
it necessary to tell natásha of prince andrews wound and of his being
with their party the countess had seldom been so angry with anyone as
she was with sónya sónya had cried and begged to be forgiven and now
as if trying to atone for her fault paid unceasing attention to her
cousin

look natásha how dreadfully it is burning said she

whats burning asked natásha oh yes moscow

and as if in order not to offend sónya and to get rid of her she turned
her face to the window looked out in such a way that it was evident
that she could not see anything and again settled down in her former
attitude

but you didnt see it

yes really i did natásha replied in a voice that pleaded to be left
in peace

both the countess and sónya understood that naturally neither moscow
nor the burning of moscow nor anything else could seem of importance to
natásha

the count returned and lay down behind the partition the countess went
up to her daughter and touched her head with the back of her hand as she
was wont to do when natásha was ill then touched her forehead with her
lips as if to feel whether she was feverish and finally kissed her

you are cold you are trembling all over youd better lie down said
the countess

lie down all right i will ill lie down at once said natásha

when natásha had been told that morning that prince andrew was seriously
wounded and was traveling with their party she had at first asked many
questions where was he going how was he wounded was it serious and
could she see him but after she had been told that she could not see
him that he was seriously wounded but that his life was not in danger
she ceased to ask questions or to speak at all evidently disbelieving
what they told her and convinced that say what she might she would
still be told the same all the way she had sat motionless in a corner
of the coach with wide open eyes and the expression in them which the
countess knew so well and feared so much and now she sat in the same
way on the bench where she had seated herself on arriving she was
planning something and either deciding or had already decided something
in her mind the countess knew this but what it might be she did not
know and this alarmed and tormented her

natásha undress darling lie down on my bed

a bed had been made on a bedstead for the countess only madame schoss
and the two girls were to sleep on some hay on the floor

no mamma i will lie down here on the floor natásha replied
irritably and she went to the window and opened it through the open
window the moans of the adjutant could be heard more distinctly she put
her head out into the damp night air and the countess saw her slim neck
shaking with sobs and throbbing against the window frame natásha knew
it was not prince andrew who was moaning she knew prince andrew was in
the same yard as themselves and in a part of the hut across the passage
but this dreadful incessant moaning made her sob the countess exchanged
a look with sónya

lie down darling lie down my pet said the countess softly
touching natáshas shoulders come lie down

oh yes ill lie down at once said natásha and began hurriedly
undressing tugging at the tapes of her petticoat

when she had thrown off her dress and put on a dressing jacket she sat
down with her foot under her on the bed that had been made up on the
floor jerked her thin and rather short plait of hair to the front and
began replaiting it her long thin practiced fingers rapidly
unplaited replaited and tied up her plait her head moved from side to
side from habit but her eyes feverishly wide looked fixedly before
her when her toilet for the night was finished she sank gently onto the
sheet spread over the hay on the side nearest the door

natásha youd better lie in the middle said sónya

ill stay here muttered natásha do lie down she added crossly
and buried her face in the pillow

the countess madame schoss and sónya undressed hastily and lay down
the small lamp in front of the icons was the only light left in the
room but in the yard there was a light from the fire at little
mytishchi a mile and a half away and through the night came the noise
of people shouting at a tavern mamonovs cossacks had set up across the
street and the adjutants unceasing moans could still be heard

for a long time natásha listened attentively to the sounds that reached
her from inside and outside the room and did not move first she heard
her mother praying and sighing and the creaking of her bed under her
then madame schoss familiar whistling snore and sónyas gentle
breathing then the countess called to natásha natásha did not answer

i think shes asleep mamma said sónya softly

after a short silence the countess spoke again but this time no one
replied

soon after that natásha heard her mothers even breathing natásha did
not move though her little bare foot thrust out from under the quilt
was growing cold on the bare floor

as if to celebrate a victory over everybody a cricket chirped in a
crack in the wall a cock crowed far off and another replied near by
the shouting in the tavern had died down only the moaning of the
adjutant was heard natásha sat up

sónya are you asleep mamma she whispered

no one replied natásha rose slowly and carefully crossed herself and
stepped cautiously on the cold and dirty floor with her slim supple
bare feet the boards of the floor creaked stepping cautiously from one
foot to the other she ran like a kitten the few steps to the door and
grasped the cold door handle

it seemed to her that something heavy was beating rhythmically against
all the walls of the room it was her own heart sinking with alarm and
terror and overflowing with love

she opened the door and stepped across the threshold and onto the cold
damp earthen floor of the passage the cold she felt refreshed her with
her bare feet she touched a sleeping man stepped over him and opened
the door into the part of the hut where prince andrew lay it was dark
in there in the farthest corner on a bench beside a bed on which
something was lying stood a tallow candle with a long thick and
smoldering wick

from the moment she had been told that morning of prince andrews wound
and his presence there natásha had resolved to see him she did not
know why she had to she knew the meeting would be painful but felt the
more convinced that it was necessary

all day she had lived only in hope of seeing him that night but now
that the moment had come she was filled with dread of what she might
see how was he maimed what was left of him was he like that incessant
moaning of the adjutants yes he was altogether like that in her
imagination he was that terrible moaning personified when she saw an
indistinct shape in the corner and mistook his knees raised under the
quilt for his shoulders she imagined a horrible body there and stood
still in terror but an irresistible impulse drew her forward she
cautiously took one step and then another and found herself in the
middle of a small room containing baggage another mantimokhinwas
lying in a corner on the benches beneath the icons and two othersthe
doctor and a valetlay on the floor

the valet sat up and whispered something timokhin kept awake by the
pain in his wounded leg gazed with wideopen eyes at this strange
apparition of a girl in a white chemise dressing jacket and nightcap
the valets sleepy frightened exclamation what do you want whats
the matter made natásha approach more swiftly to what was lying in the
corner horribly unlike a man as that body looked she must see him she
passed the valet the snuff fell from the candle wick and she saw
prince andrew clearly with his arms outside the quilt and such as she
had always seen him

he was the same as ever but the feverish color of his face his
glittering eyes rapturously turned toward her and especially his neck
delicate as a childs revealed by the turndown collar of his shirt
gave him a peculiarly innocent childlike look such as she had never
seen on him before she went up to him and with a swift flexible
youthful movement dropped on her knees

he smiled and held out his hand to her





chapter xxxii

seven days had passed since prince andrew found himself in the ambulance
station on the field of borodino his feverish state and the
inflammation of his bowels which were injured were in the doctors
opinion sure to carry him off but on the seventh day he ate with
pleasure a piece of bread with some tea and the doctor noticed that his
temperature was lower he had regained consciousness that morning the
first night after they left moscow had been fairly warm and he had
remained in the caleche but at mytishchi the wounded man himself asked
to be taken out and given some tea the pain caused by his removal into
the hut had made him groan aloud and again lose consciousness when he
had been placed on his camp bed he lay for a long time motionless with
closed eyes then he opened them and whispered softly and the tea
his remembering such a small detail of everyday life astonished the
doctor he felt prince andrews pulse and to his surprise and
dissatisfaction found it had improved he was dissatisfied because he
knew by experience that if his patient did not die now he would do so a
little later with greater suffering timokhin the rednosed major of
prince andrews regiment had joined him in moscow and was being taken
along with him having been wounded in the leg at the battle of
borodino they were accompanied by a doctor prince andrews valet his
coachman and two orderlies

they gave prince andrew some tea he drank it eagerly looking with
feverish eyes at the door in front of him as if trying to understand and
remember something

i dont want any more is timokhin here he asked

timokhin crept along the bench to him

i am here your excellency

hows your wound

mine sir all right but how about you

prince andrew again pondered as if trying to remember something

couldnt one get a book he asked

what book

the gospels i havent one

the doctor promised to procure it for him and began to ask how he was
feeling prince andrew answered all his questions reluctantly but
reasonably and then said he wanted a bolster placed under him as he was
uncomfortable and in great pain the doctor and valet lifted the cloak
with which he was covered and making wry faces at the noisome smell of
mortifying flesh that came from the wound began examining that dreadful
place the doctor was very much displeased about something and made a
change in the dressings turning the wounded man over so that he groaned
again and grew unconscious and delirious from the agony he kept asking
them to get him the book and put it under him

what trouble would it be to you he said i have not got one please
get it for me and put it under for a moment he pleaded in a piteous
voice

the doctor went into the passage to wash his hands

you fellows have no conscience said he to the valet who was pouring
water over his hands for just one moment i didnt look after you
its such pain you know that i wonder how he can bear it

by the lord jesus christ i thought we had put something under him
said the valet

the first time prince andrew understood where he was and what was the
matter with him and remembered being wounded and how was when he asked
to be carried into the hut after his caleche had stopped at mytishchi
after growing confused from pain while being carried into the hut he
again regained consciousness and while drinking tea once more recalled
all that had happened to him and above all vividly remembered the
moment at the ambulance station when at the sight of the sufferings of
a man he disliked those new thoughts had come to him which promised him
happiness and those thoughts though now vague and indefinite again
possessed his soul he remembered that he had now a new source of
happiness and that this happiness had something to do with the gospels
that was why he asked for a copy of them the uncomfortable position in
which they had put him and turned him over again confused his thoughts
and when he came to himself a third time it was in the complete
stillness of the night everybody near him was sleeping a cricket
chirped from across the passage someone was shouting and singing in the
street cockroaches rustled on the table on the icons and on the
walls and a big fly flopped at the head of the bed and around the
candle beside him the wick of which was charred and had shaped itself
like a mushroom

his mind was not in a normal state a healthy man usually thinks of
feels and remembers innumerable things simultaneously but has the
power and will to select one sequence of thoughts or events on which to
fix his whole attention a healthy man can tear himself away from the
deepest reflections to say a civil word to someone who comes in and can
then return again to his own thoughts but prince andrews mind was not
in a normal state in that respect all the powers of his mind were more
active and clearer than ever but they acted apart from his will most
diverse thoughts and images occupied him simultaneously at times his
brain suddenly began to work with a vigor clearness and depth it had
never reached when he was in health but suddenly in the midst of its
work it would turn to some unexpected idea and he had not the strength
to turn it back again

yes a new happiness was revealed to me of which man cannot be
deprived he thought as he lay in the semidarkness of the quiet hut
gazing fixedly before him with feverish wide open eyes a happiness
lying beyond material forces outside the material influences that act
on mana happiness of the soul alone the happiness of loving every man
can understand it but to conceive it and enjoin it was possible only
for god but how did god enjoin that law and why was the son

and suddenly the sequence of these thoughts broke off and prince andrew
heard without knowing whether it was a delusion or reality a soft
whispering voice incessantly and rhythmically repeating pitipiti
piti and then titi and then again pitipitipiti and titi
once more at the same time he felt that above his face above the very
middle of it some strange airy structure was being erected out of
slender needles or splinters to the sound of this whispered music he
felt that he had to balance carefully though it was difficult so that
this airy structure should not collapse but nevertheless it kept
collapsing and again slowly rising to the sound of whispered rhythmic
musicit stretches stretches spreading out and stretching said
prince andrew to himself while listening to this whispering and feeling
the sensation of this drawing out and the construction of this edifice
of needles he also saw by glimpses a red halo round the candle and
heard the rustle of the cockroaches and the buzzing of the fly that
flopped against his pillow and his face each time the fly touched his
face it gave him a burning sensation and yet to his surprise it did not
destroy the structure though it knocked against the very region of his
face where it was rising but besides this there was something else of
importance it was something white by the doorthe statue of a sphinx
which also oppressed him

but perhaps thats my shirt on the table he thought and thats my
legs and that is the door but why is it always stretching and drawing
itself out and pitipitipiti and titi and pitipitipiti
thats enough please leave off prince andrew painfully entreated
someone and suddenly thoughts and feelings again swam to the surface of
his mind with peculiar clearness and force

yeslove he thought again quite clearly but not love which loves
for something for some quality for some purpose or for some reason
but the love which iwhile dyingfirst experienced when i saw my enemy
and yet loved him i experienced that feeling of love which is the very
essence of the soul and does not require an object now again i feel
that bliss to love ones neighbors to love ones enemies to love
everything to love god in all his manifestations it is possible to
love someone dear to you with human love but an enemy can only be loved
by divine love that is why i experienced such joy when i felt that i
loved that man what has become of him is he alive

when loving with human love one may pass from love to hatred but
divine love cannot change no neither death nor anything else can
destroy it it is the very essence of the soul yet how many people have
i hated in my life and of them all i loved and hated none as i did
her and he vividly pictured to himself natásha not as he had done in
the past with nothing but her charms which gave him delight but for the
first time picturing to himself her soul and he understood her
feelings her sufferings shame and remorse he now understood for the
first time all the cruelty of his rejection of her the cruelty of his
rupture with her if only it were possible for me to see her once more
just once looking into those eyes to say

pitipitipiti and titi and pitipitipiti boom flopped the fly
and his attention was suddenly carried into another world a world of
reality and delirium in which something particular was happening in
that world some structure was still being erected and did not fall
something was still stretching out and the candle with its red halo was
still burning and the same shirtlike sphinx lay near the door but
besides all this something creaked there was a whiff of fresh air and
a new white sphinx appeared standing at the door and that sphinx had
the pale face and shining eyes of the very natásha of whom he had just
been thinking

oh how oppressive this continual delirium is thought prince andrew
trying to drive that face from his imagination but the face remained
before him with the force of reality and drew nearer prince andrew
wished to return to that former world of pure thought but he could not
and delirium drew him back into its domain the soft whispering voice
continued its rhythmic murmur something oppressed him and stretched
out and the strange face was before him prince andrew collected all
his strength in an effort to recover his senses he moved a little and
suddenly there was a ringing in his ears a dimness in his eyes and
like a man plunged into water he lost consciousness when he came to
himself natásha that same living natásha whom of all people he most
longed to love with this new pure divine love that had been revealed to
him was kneeling before him he realized that it was the real living
natásha and he was not surprised but quietly happy natásha motionless
on her knees she was unable to stir with frightened eyes riveted on
him was restraining her sobs her face was pale and rigid only in the
lower part of it something quivered

prince andrew sighed with relief smiled and held out his hand

you he said how fortunate

with a rapid but careful movement natásha drew nearer to him on her
knees and taking his hand carefully bent her face over it and began
kissing it just touching it lightly with her lips

forgive me she whispered raising her head and glancing at him
forgive me

i love you said prince andrew

forgive

forgive what he asked

forgive me for what i have done faltered natásha in a scarcely
audible broken whisper and began kissing his hand more rapidly just
touching it with her lips

i love you more better than before said prince andrew lifting her
face with his hand so as to look into her eyes

those eyes filled with happy tears gazed at him timidly
compassionately and with joyous love natáshas thin pale face with
its swollen lips was more than plainit was dreadful but prince andrew
did not see that he saw her shining eyes which were beautiful they
heard the sound of voices behind them

peter the valet who was now wide awake had roused the doctor
timokhin who had not slept at all because of the pain in his leg had
long been watching all that was going on carefully covering his bare
body with the sheet as he huddled up on his bench

whats this said the doctor rising from his bed please go away
madam

at that moment a maid sent by the countess who had noticed her
daughters absence knocked at the door

like a somnambulist aroused from her sleep natásha went out of the room
and returning to her hut fell sobbing on her bed

from that time during all the rest of the rostóvs journey at every
halting place and wherever they spent a night natásha never left the
wounded bolkónski and the doctor had to admit that he had not expected
from a young girl either such firmness or such skill in nursing a
wounded man

dreadful as the countess imagined it would be should prince andrew die
in her daughters arms during the journeyas judging by what the doctor
said it seemed might easily happenshe could not oppose natásha though
with the intimacy now established between the wounded man and natásha
the thought occurred that should he recover their former engagement
would be renewed no oneleast of all natásha and prince andrewspoke of
this the unsettled question of life and death which hung not only over
bolkónski but over all russia shut out all other considerations





chapter xxxiii

on the third of september pierre awoke late his head was aching the
clothes in which he had slept without undressing felt uncomfortable on
his body and his mind had a dim consciousness of something shameful he
had done the day before that something shameful was his yesterdays
conversation with captain ramballe

it was eleven by the clock but it seemed peculiarly dark out of doors
pierre rose rubbed his eyes and seeing the pistol with an engraved
stock which gerasim had replaced on the writing table he remembered
where he was and what lay before him that very day

am i not too late he thought no probably he wont make his entry
into moscow before noon

pierre did not allow himself to reflect on what lay before him but
hastened to act

after arranging his clothes he took the pistol and was about to go out
but it then occurred to him for the first time that he certainly could
not carry the weapon in his hand through the streets it was difficult
to hide such a big pistol even under his wide coat he could not carry
it unnoticed in his belt or under his arm besides it had been
discharged and he had not had time to reload it no matter dagger
will do he said to himself though when planning his design he had
more than once come to the conclusion that the chief mistake made by the
student in  had been to try to kill napoleon with a dagger but as
his chief aim consisted not in carrying out his design but in proving
to himself that he would not abandon his intention and was doing all he
could to achieve it pierre hastily took the blunt jagged dagger in a
green sheath which he had bought at the sukharev market with the pistol
and hid it under his waistcoat

having tied a girdle over his coat and pulled his cap low on his head
pierre went down the corridor trying to avoid making a noise or meeting
the captain and passed out into the street

the conflagration at which he had looked with so much indifference the
evening before had greatly increased during the night moscow was on
fire in several places the buildings in carriage row across the river
in the bazaar and the povarskoy as well as the barges on the moskva
river and the timber yards by the dorogomilov bridge were all ablaze

pierres way led through side streets to the povarskoy and from there to
the church of st nicholas on the arbat where he had long before
decided that the deed should be done the gates of most of the houses
were locked and the shutters up the streets and lanes were deserted
the air was full of smoke and the smell of burning now and then he met
russians with anxious and timid faces and frenchmen with an air not of
the city but of the camp walking in the middle of the streets both the
russians and the french looked at pierre with surprise besides his
height and stoutness and the strange morose look of suffering in his
face and whole figure the russians stared at pierre because they could
not make out to what class he could belong the french followed him with
astonishment in their eyes chiefly because pierre unlike all the other
russians who gazed at the french with fear and curiosity paid no
attention to them at the gate of one house three frenchmen who were
explaining something to some russians who did not understand them
stopped pierre asking if he did not know french

pierre shook his head and went on in another side street a sentinel
standing beside a green caisson shouted at him but only when the shout
was threateningly repeated and he heard the click of the mans musket as
he raised it did pierre understand that he had to pass on the other side
of the street he heard nothing and saw nothing of what went on around
him he carried his resolution within himself in terror and haste like
something dreadful and alien to him for after the previous nights
experience he was afraid of losing it but he was not destined to bring
his mood safely to his destination and even had he not been hindered by
anything on the way his intention could not now have been carried out
for napoleon had passed the arbat more than four hours previously on his
way from the dorogomilov suburb to the kremlin and was now sitting in a
very gloomy frame of mind in a royal study in the kremlin giving
detailed and exact orders as to measures to be taken immediately to
extinguish the fire to prevent looting and to reassure the
inhabitants but pierre did not know this he was entirely absorbed in
what lay before him and was torturedas those are who obstinately
undertake a task that is impossible for them not because of its
difficulty but because of its incompatibility with their naturesby the
fear of weakening at the decisive moment and so losing his selfesteem

though he heard and saw nothing around him he found his way by instinct
and did not go wrong in the side streets that led to the povarskoy

as pierre approached that street the smoke became denser and denserhe
even felt the heat of the fire occasionally curly tongues of flame rose
from under the roofs of the houses he met more people in the streets
and they were more excited but pierre though he felt that something
unusual was happening around him did not realize that he was
approaching the fire as he was going along a foot path across a wide
open space adjoining the povarskoy on one side and the gardens of prince
gruzinskis house on the other pierre suddenly heard the desperate
weeping of a woman close to him he stopped as if awakening from a dream
and lifted his head

by the side of the path on the dusty dry grass all sorts of household
goods lay in a heap featherbeds a samovar icons and trunks on the
ground beside the trunks sat a thin woman no longer young with long
prominent upper teeth and wearing a black cloak and cap this woman
swaying to and fro and muttering something was choking with sobs two
girls of about ten and twelve dressed in dirty short frocks and cloaks
were staring at their mother with a look of stupefaction on their pale
frightened faces the youngest child a boy of about seven who wore an
overcoat and an immense cap evidently not his own was crying in his old
nurses arms a dirty barefooted maid was sitting on a trunk and
having undone her palecolored plait was pulling it straight and
sniffing at her singed hair the womans husband a short round
shouldered man in the undress uniform of a civilian official with
sausageshaped whiskers and showing under his squareset cap the hair
smoothly brushed forward over his temples with expressionless face was
moving the trunks which were placed one on another and was dragging
some garments from under them

as soon as she saw pierre the woman almost threw herself at his feet

dear people good christians save me help me dear friends help
us somebody she muttered between her sobs my girl my daughter
my youngest daughter is left behind shes burned ooh was it for this
i nursed you ooh

dont mary nikolievna said her husband to her in a low voice
evidently only to justify himself before the stranger sister must have
taken her or else where can she be he added

monster villain shouted the woman angrily suddenly ceasing to weep
you have no heart you dont feel for your own child another man would
have rescued her from the fire but this is a monster and neither a man
nor a father you honored sir are a noble man she went on
addressing pierre rapidly between her sobs the fire broke out
alongside and blew our way the maid called out fire and we rushed
to collect our things we ran out just as we were this is what we
have brought away the icons and my dowry bed all the rest is lost
we seized the children but not katie ooh o lord and again she
began to sob my child my dear one burned burned

but where was she left asked pierre

from the expression of his animated face the woman saw that this man
might help her

oh dear sir she cried seizing him by the legs my benefactor set
my heart at ease aniska go you horrid girl show him the way she
cried to the maid angrily opening her mouth and still farther exposing
her long teeth

show me the way show me i ill do it gasped pierre rapidly

the dirty maidservant stepped from behind the trunk put up her plait
sighed and went on her short bare feet along the path pierre felt as
if he had come back to life after a heavy swoon he held his head
higher his eyes shone with the light of life and with swift steps he
followed the maid overtook her and came out on the povarskoy the
whole street was full of clouds of black smoke tongues of flame here
and there broke through that cloud a great number of people crowded in
front of the conflagration in the middle of the street stood a french
general saying something to those around him pierre accompanied by the
maid was advancing to the spot where the general stood but the french
soldiers stopped him

on ne passe pas  cried a voice

 you cant pass

this way uncle cried the girl well pass through the side street
by the nikulins

pierre turned back giving a spring now and then to keep up with her
she ran across the street turned down a side street to the left and
passing three houses turned into a yard on the right

its here close by said she and running across the yard opened a
gate in a wooden fence and stopping pointed out to him a small wooden
wing of the house which was burning brightly and fiercely one of its
sides had fallen in another was on fire and bright flames issued from
the openings of the windows and from under the roof

as pierre passed through the fence gate he was enveloped by hot air and
involuntarily stopped

which is it which is your house he asked

ooh wailed the girl pointing to the wing thats it that was our
lodging youve burned to death our treasure katie my precious little
missy ooh lamented aniska who at the sight of the fire felt that she
too must give expression to her feelings

pierre rushed to the wing but the heat was so great that he
involuntarily passed round in a curve and came upon the large house that
was as yet burning only at one end just below the roof and around
which swarmed a crowd of frenchmen at first pierre did not realize what
these men who were dragging something out were about but seeing
before him a frenchman hitting a peasant with a blunt saber and trying
to take from him a foxfur coat he vaguely understood that looting was
going on there but he had no time to dwell on that idea

the sounds of crackling and the din of falling walls and ceilings the
whistle and hiss of the flames the excited shouts of the people and
the sight of the swaying smoke now gathering into thick black clouds
and now soaring up with glittering sparks with here and there dense
sheaves of flame now red and now like golden fish scales creeping along
the walls and the heat and smoke and rapidity of motion produced on
pierre the usual animating effects of a conflagration it had a
peculiarly strong effect on him because at the sight of the fire he felt
himself suddenly freed from the ideas that had weighed him down he felt
young bright adroit and resolute he ran round to the other side of
the lodge and was about to dash into that part of it which was still
standing when just above his head he heard several voices shouting and
then a cracking sound and the ring of something heavy falling close
beside him

pierre looked up and saw at a window of the large house some frenchmen
who had just thrown out the drawer of a chest filled with metal
articles other french soldiers standing below went up to the drawer

what does this fellow want shouted one of them referring to pierre

theres a child in that house havent you seen a child cried pierre

whats he talking about get along said several voices and one of
the soldiers evidently afraid that pierre might want to take from them
some of the plate and bronzes that were in the drawer moved
threateningly toward him

a child shouted a frenchman from above i did hear something
squealing in the garden perhaps its his brat that the fellow is
looking for after all one must be human you know

where is it where said pierre

there there shouted the frenchman at the window pointing to the
garden at the back of the house wait a bitim coming down

and a minute or two later the frenchman a blackeyed fellow with a spot
on his cheek in shirt sleeves really did jump out of a window on the
ground floor and clapping pierre on the shoulder ran with him into the
garden

hurry up you others he called out to his comrades its getting
hot

when they reached a gravel path behind the house the frenchman pulled
pierre by the arm and pointed to a round graveled space where a three
yearold girl in a pink dress was lying under a seat

there is your child oh a girl so much the better said the
frenchman goodbye fatty we must be human we are all mortal you
know and the frenchman with the spot on his cheek ran back to his
comrades

breathless with joy pierre ran to the little girl and was going to take
her in his arms but seeing a stranger the sickly scrofulouslooking
child unattractively like her mother began to yell and run away
pierre however seized her and lifted her in his arms she screamed
desperately and angrily and tried with her little hands to pull pierres
hands away and to bite them with her slobbering mouth pierre was seized
by a sense of horror and repulsion such as he had experienced when
touching some nasty little animal but he made an effort not to throw
the child down and ran with her to the large house it was now however
impossible to get back the way he had come the maid aniska was no
longer there and pierre with a feeling of pity and disgust pressed the
wet painfully sobbing child to himself as tenderly as he could and ran
with her through the garden seeking another way out





chapter xxxiv

having run through different yards and side streets pierre got back
with his little burden to the gruzinski garden at the corner of the
povarskoy he did not at first recognize the place from which he had set
out to look for the child so crowded was it now with people and goods
that had been dragged out of the houses besides russian families who
had taken refuge here from the fire with their belongings there were
several french soldiers in a variety of clothing pierre took no notice
of them he hurried to find the family of that civil servant in order to
restore the daughter to her mother and go to save someone else pierre
felt that he had still much to do and to do quickly glowing with the
heat and from running he felt at that moment more strongly than ever
the sense of youth animation and determination that had come on him
when he ran to save the child she had now become quiet and clinging
with her little hands to pierres coat sat on his arm gazing about her
like some little wild animal he glanced at her occasionally with a
slight smile he fancied he saw something pathetically innocent in that
frightened sickly little face

he did not find the civil servant or his wife where he had left them he
walked among the crowd with rapid steps scanning the various faces he
met involuntarily he noticed a georgian or armenian family consisting
of a very handsome old man of oriental type wearing a new cloth
covered sheepskin coat and new boots an old woman of similar type and
a young woman that very young woman seemed to pierre the perfection of
oriental beauty with her sharply outlined arched black eyebrows and
the extraordinarily soft bright color of her long beautiful
expressionless face amid the scattered property and the crowd on the
open space she in her rich satin cloak with a bright lilac shawl on
her head suggested a delicate exotic plant thrown out onto the snow
she was sitting on some bundles a little behind the old woman and
looked from under her long lashes with motionless large almondshaped
eyes at the ground before her evidently she was aware of her beauty and
fearful because of it her face struck pierre and hurrying along by the
fence he turned several times to look at her when he had reached the
fence still without finding those he sought he stopped and looked
about him

with the child in his arms his figure was now more conspicuous than
before and a group of russians both men and women gathered about him

have you lost anyone my dear fellow youre of the gentry yourself
arent you whose child is it they asked him

pierre replied that the child belonged to a woman in a black coat who
had been sitting there with her other children and he asked whether
anyone knew where she had gone

why that must be the anferovs said an old deacon addressing a
pockmarked peasant woman lord have mercy lord have mercy he added
in his customary bass

the anferovs no said the woman they left in the morning that must
be either mary nikolievnas or the ivanovs

he says a woman and mary nikolievna is a lady remarked a house
serf

do you know her shes thin with long teeth said pierre

thats mary nikolievna they went inside the garden when these wolves
swooped down said the woman pointing to the french soldiers

o lord have mercy added the deacon

go over that way theyre there its she she kept on lamenting and
crying continued the woman its she here this way

but pierre was not listening to the woman he had for some seconds been
intently watching what was going on a few steps away he was looking at
the armenian family and at two french soldiers who had gone up to them
one of these a nimble little man was wearing a blue coat tied round
the waist with a rope he had a nightcap on his head and his feet were
bare the other whose appearance particularly struck pierre was a
long lank roundshouldered fairhaired man slow in his movements and
with an idiotic expression of face he wore a womans loose gown of
frieze blue trousers and large torn hessian boots the little
barefooted frenchman in the blue coat went up to the armenians and
saying something immediately seized the old man by his legs and the old
man at once began pulling off his boots the other in the frieze gown
stopped in front of the beautiful armenian girl and with his hands in
his pockets stood staring at her motionless and silent

here take the child said pierre peremptorily and hurriedly to the
woman handing the little girl to her give her back to them give her
back he almost shouted putting the child who began screaming on the
ground and again looking at the frenchman and the armenian family

the old man was already sitting barefoot the little frenchman had
secured his second boot and was slapping one boot against the other the
old man was saying something in a voice broken by sobs but pierre
caught but a glimpse of this his whole attention was directed to the
frenchman in the frieze gown who meanwhile swaying slowly from side to
side had drawn nearer to the young woman and taking his hands from his
pockets had seized her by the neck

the beautiful armenian still sat motionless and in the same attitude
with her long lashes drooping as if she did not see or feel what the
soldier was doing to her

while pierre was running the few steps that separated him from the
frenchman the tall marauder in the frieze gown was already tearing from
her neck the necklace the young armenian was wearing and the young
woman clutching at her neck screamed piercingly

let that woman alone exclaimed pierre hoarsely in a furious voice
seizing the soldier by his round shoulders and throwing him aside

the soldier fell got up and ran away but his comrade throwing down
the boots and drawing his sword moved threateningly toward pierre

voyons pas de betises  he cried

 look here no nonsense

pierre was in such a transport of rage that he remembered nothing and
his strength increased tenfold he rushed at the barefooted frenchman
and before the latter had time to draw his sword knocked him off his
feet and hammered him with his fists shouts of approval were heard from
the crowd around and at the same moment a mounted patrol of french
uhlans appeared from round the corner the uhlans came up at a trot to
pierre and the frenchman and surrounded them pierre remembered nothing
of what happened after that he only remembered beating someone and
being beaten and finally feeling that his hands were bound and that a
crowd of french soldiers stood around him and were searching him

lieutenant he has a dagger were the first words pierre understood

ah a weapon said the officer and turned to the barefooted soldier
who had been arrested with pierre all right you can tell all about it
at the courtmartial then he turned to pierre do you speak french

pierre looked around him with bloodshot eyes and did not reply his face
probably looked very terrible for the officer said something in a
whisper and four more uhlans left the ranks and placed themselves on
both sides of pierre

do you speak french the officer asked again keeping at a distance
from pierre call the interpreter

a little man in russian civilian clothes rode out from the ranks and by
his clothes and manner of speaking pierre at once knew him to be a
french salesman from one of the moscow shops

he does not look like a common man said the interpreter after a
searching look at pierre

ah he looks very much like an incendiary remarked the officer and
ask him who he is he added

who are you asked the interpreter in poor russian you must answer
the chief

i will not tell you who i am i am your prisonertake me pierre
suddenly replied in french

ah ah muttered the officer with a frown well then march

a crowd had collected round the uhlans nearest to pierre stood the
pockmarked peasant woman with the little girl and when the patrol
started she moved forward

where are they taking you to you poor dear said she and the little
girl the little girl what am i to do with her if shes not theirs
said the woman

what does that woman want asked the officer

pierre was as if intoxicated his elation increased at the sight of the
little girl he had saved

what does she want he murmured she is bringing me my daughter whom
i have just saved from the flames said he goodbye and without
knowing how this aimless lie had escaped him he went along with
resolute and triumphant steps between the french soldiers

the french patrol was one of those sent out through the various streets
of moscow by durosnels order to put a stop to the pillage and
especially to catch the incendiaries who according to the general
opinion which had that day originated among the higher french officers
were the cause of the conflagrations after marching through a number of
streets the patrol arrested five more russian suspects a small
shopkeeper two seminary students a peasant and a house serf besides
several looters but of all these various suspected characters pierre
was considered to be the most suspicious of all when they had all been
brought for the night to a large house on the zubov rampart that was
being used as a guardhouse pierre was placed apart under strict guard





book twelve





chapter i

in petersburg at that time a complicated struggle was being carried on
with greater heat than ever in the highest circles between the parties
of rumyántsev the french márya fëdorovna the tsarevich and others
drowned as usual by the buzzing of the court drones but the calm
luxurious life of petersburg concerned only about phantoms and
reflections of real life went on in its old way and made it hard
except by a great effort to realize the danger and the difficult
position of the russian people there were the same receptions and
balls the same french theater the same court interests and service
interests and intrigues as usual only in the very highest circles were
attempts made to keep in mind the difficulties of the actual position
stories were whispered of how differently the two empresses behaved in
these difficult circumstances the empress márya concerned for the
welfare of the charitable and educational institutions under her
patronage had given directions that they should all be removed to
kazan and the things belonging to these institutions had already been
packed up the empress elisabeth however when asked what instructions
she would be pleased to givewith her characteristic russian patriotism
had replied that she could give no directions about state institutions
for that was the affair of the sovereign but as far as she personally
was concerned she would be the last to quit petersburg

at anna pávlovnas on the twentysixth of august the very day of the
battle of borodino there was a soiree the chief feature of which was
to be the reading of a letter from his lordship the bishop when sending
the emperor an icon of the venerable sergius it was regarded as a model
of ecclesiastical patriotic eloquence prince vasíli himself famed for
his elocution was to read it he used to read at the empress the
art of his reading was supposed to lie in rolling out the words quite
independently of their meaning in a loud and singsong voice alternating
between a despairing wail and a tender murmur so that the wail fell
quite at random on one word and the murmur on another this reading as
was always the case at anna pávlovnas soirees had a political
significance that evening she expected several important personages who
had to be made ashamed of their visits to the french theater and aroused
to a patriotic temper a good many people had already arrived but anna
pávlovna not yet seeing all those whom she wanted in her drawing room
did not let the reading begin but wound up the springs of a general
conversation

the news of the day in petersburg was the illness of countess bezúkhova
she had fallen ill unexpectedly a few days previously had missed
several gatherings of which she was usually ornament and was said to be
receiving no one and instead of the celebrated petersburg doctors who
usually attended her had entrusted herself to some italian doctor who
was treating her in some new and unusual way

they all knew very well that the enchanting countess illness arose from
an inconvenience resulting from marrying two husbands at the same time
and that the italians cure consisted in removing such inconvenience
but in anna pávlovnas presence no one dared to think of this or even
appear to know it

they say the poor countess is very ill the doctor says it is angina
pectoris

angina oh thats a terrible illness

they say that the rivals are reconciled thanks to the angina and
the word angina was repeated with great satisfaction

the count is pathetic they say he cried like a child when the doctor
told him the case was dangerous

oh it would be a terrible loss she is an enchanting woman

you are speaking of the poor countess said anna pávlovna coming up
just then i sent to ask for news and hear that she is a little
better oh she is certainly the most charming woman in the world she
went on with a smile at her own enthusiasm we belong to different
camps but that does not prevent my esteeming her as she deserves she
is very unfortunate added anna pávlovna

supposing that by these words anna pávlovna was somewhat lifting the
veil from the secret of the countess malady an unwary young man
ventured to express surprise that well known doctors had not been called
in and that the countess was being attended by a charlatan who might
employ dangerous remedies

your information may be better than mine anna pávlovna suddenly and
venomously retorted on the inexperienced young man but i know on good
authority that this doctor is a very learned and able man he is private
physician to the queen of spain

and having thus demolished the young man anna pávlovna turned to
another group where bilibin was talking about the austrians having
wrinkled up his face he was evidently preparing to smooth it out again
and utter one of his mots

i think it is delightful he said referring to a diplomatic note that
had been sent to vienna with some austrian banners captured from the
french by wittgenstein the hero of petropol as he was then called in
petersburg

what whats that asked anna pávlovna securing silence for the mot
which she had heard before

and bilibin repeated the actual words of the diplomatic dispatch which
he had himself composed

the emperor returns these austrian banners said bilibin friendly
banners gone astray and found on a wrong path and his brow became
smooth again

charming charming observed prince vasíli

the path to warsaw perhaps prince hippolyte remarked loudly and
unexpectedly everybody looked at him understanding what he meant
prince hippolyte himself glanced around with amused surprise he knew no
more than the others what his words meant during his diplomatic career
he had more than once noticed that such utterances were received as very
witty and at every opportunity he uttered in that way the first words
that entered his head it may turn out very well he thought but if
not theyll know how to arrange matters and really during the
awkward silence that ensued that insufficiently patriotic person
entered whom anna pávlovna had been waiting for and wished to convert
and she smiling and shaking a finger at hippolyte invited prince
vasíli to the table and bringing him two candles and the manuscript
begged him to begin everyone became silent

most gracious sovereign and emperor prince vasíli sternly declaimed
looking round at his audience as if to inquire whether anyone had
anything to say to the contrary but no one said anything moscow our
ancient capital the new jerusalem receives her christhe placed a
sudden emphasis on the word heras a mother receives her zealous sons
into her arms and through the gathering mists foreseeing the brilliant
glory of thy rule sings in exultation hosanna blessed is he that
cometh

prince vasíli pronounced these last words in a tearful voice

bilibin attentively examined his nails and many of those present
appeared intimidated as if asking in what they were to blame anna
pávlovna whispered the next words in advance like an old woman
muttering the prayer at communion let the bold and insolent
goliath she whispered

prince vasíli continued

let the bold and insolent goliath from the borders of france encompass
the realms of russia with deathbearing terrors humble faith the sling
of the russian david shall suddenly smite his head in his bloodthirsty
pride this icon of the venerable sergius the servant of god and
zealous champion of old of our countrys weal is offered to your
imperial majesty i grieve that my waning strength prevents rejoicing in
the sight of your most gracious presence i raise fervent prayers to
heaven that the almighty may exalt the race of the just and mercifully
fulfill the desires of your majesty

what force what a style was uttered in approval both of reader and
of author

animated by that address anna pávlovnas guests talked for a long time
of the state of the fatherland and offered various conjectures as to the
result of the battle to be fought in a few days

you will see said anna pávlovna that tomorrow on the emperors
birthday we shall receive news i have a favorable presentiment





chapter ii

anna pávlovnas presentiment was in fact fulfilled next day during the
service at the palace church in honor of the emperors birthday prince
volkonski was called out of the church and received a dispatch from
prince kutúzov it was kutúzovs report written from tatarinova on the
day of the battle kutúzov wrote that the russians had not retreated a
step that the french losses were much heavier than ours and that he
was writing in haste from the field of battle before collecting full
information it followed that there must have been a victory and at
once without leaving the church thanks were rendered to the creator
for his help and for the victory

anna pávlovnas presentiment was justified and all that morning a
joyously festive mood reigned in the city everyone believed the victory
to have been complete and some even spoke of napoleons having been
captured of his deposition and of the choice of a new ruler for
france

it is very difficult for events to be reflected in their real strength
and completeness amid the conditions of court life and far from the
scene of action general events involuntarily group themselves around
some particular incident so now the courtiers pleasure was based as
much on the fact that the news had arrived on the emperors birthday as
on the fact of the victory itself it was like a successfully arranged
surprise mention was made in kutúzovs report of the russian losses
among which figured the names of tuchkov bagration and kutaysov in
the petersburg world this sad side of the affair again involuntarily
centered round a single incident kutaysovs death everybody knew him
the emperor liked him and he was young and interesting that day
everyone met with the words

what a wonderful coincidence just during the service but what a loss
kutaysov is how sorry i am

what did i tell about kutúzov prince vasíli now said with a prophets
pride i always said he was the only man capable of defeating
napoleon

but next day no news arrived from the army and the public mood grew
anxious the courtiers suffered because of the suffering the suspense
occasioned the emperor

fancy the emperors position said they and instead of extolling
kutúzov as they had done the day before they condemned him as the cause
of the emperors anxiety that day prince vasíli no longer boasted of
his protege kutúzov but remained silent when the commanderinchief was
mentioned moreover toward evening as if everything conspired to make
petersburg society anxious and uneasy a terrible piece of news was
added countess hélène bezúkhova had suddenly died of that terrible
malady it had been so agreeable to mention officially at large
gatherings everyone said that countess bezúkhova had died of a terrible
attack of angina pectoris but in intimate circles details were
mentioned of how the private physician of the queen of spain had
prescribed small doses of a certain drug to produce a certain effect
but hélène tortured by the fact that the old count suspected her and
that her husband to whom she had written that wretched profligate
pierre had not replied had suddenly taken a very large dose of the
drug and had died in agony before assistance could be rendered her it
was said that prince vasíli and the old count had turned upon the
italian but the latter had produced such letters from the unfortunate
deceased that they had immediately let the matter drop

talk in general centered round three melancholy facts the emperors
lack of news the loss of kutaysov and the death of hélène

on the third day after kutúzovs report a country gentleman arrived from
moscow and news of the surrender of moscow to the french spread through
the whole town this was terrible what a position for the emperor to be
in kutúzov was a traitor and prince vasíli during the visits of
condolence paid to him on the occasion of his daughters death said of
kutúzov whom he had formerly praised it was excusable for him in his
grief to forget what he had said that it was impossible to expect
anything else from a blind and depraved old man

i only wonder that the fate of russia could have been entrusted to such
a man

as long as this news remained unofficial it was possible to doubt it
but the next day the following communication was received from count
rostopchin

prince kutúzovs adjutant has brought me a letter in which he demands
police officers to guide the army to the ryazan road he writes that he
is regretfully abandoning moscow sire kutúzovs action decides the
fate of the capital and of your empire russia will shudder to learn of
the abandonment of the city in which her greatness is centered and in
which lie the ashes of your ancestors i shall follow the army i have
had everything removed and it only remains for me to weep over the fate
of my fatherland

on receiving this dispatch the emperor sent prince volkonski to kutúzov
with the following rescript

prince michael ilariónovich since the twentyninth of august i have
received no communication from you yet on the first of september i
received from the commanderinchief of moscow via yaroslavl the sad
news that you with the army have decided to abandon moscow you can
yourself imagine the effect this news has had on me and your silence
increases my astonishment i am sending this by adjutantgeneral prince
volkonski to hear from you the situation of the army and the reasons
that have induced you to take this melancholy decision





chapter iii

nine days after the abandonment of moscow a messenger from kutúzov
reached petersburg with the official announcement of that event this
messenger was michaud a frenchman who did not know russian but who was
quoique etranger russe de coeur et dame  as he said of himself

 though a foreigner russian in heart and soul

the emperor at once received this messenger in his study at the palace
on stone island michaud who had never seen moscow before the campaign
and who did not know russian yet felt deeply moved as he wrote when
he appeared before notre tres gracieux souverain  with the news of the
burning of moscow dont les flammes eclairaient sa route

 our most gracious sovereign

  whose flames illumined his route

though the source of m michauds chagrin must have been different from
that which caused russians to grieve he had such a sad face when shown
into the emperors study that the latter at once asked

have you brought me sad news colonel

very sad sire replied michaud lowering his eyes with a sigh the
abandonment of moscow

have they surrendered my ancient capital without a battle asked the
emperor quickly his face suddenly flushing

michaud respectfully delivered the message kutúzov had entrusted to him
which was that it had been impossible to fight before moscow and that
as the only remaining choice was between losing the army as well as
moscow or losing moscow alone the field marshal had to choose the
latter

the emperor listened in silence not looking at michaud

has the enemy entered the city he asked

yes sire and moscow is now in ashes i left it all in flames
replied michaud in a decided tone but glancing at the emperor he was
frightened by what he had done

the emperor began to breathe heavily and rapidly his lower lip
trembled and tears instantly appeared in his fine blue eyes

but this lasted only a moment he suddenly frowned as if blaming
himself for his weakness and raising his head addressed michaud in a
firm voice

i see colonel from all that is happening that providence requires
great sacrifices of us i am ready to submit myself in all things to
his will but tell me michaud how did you leave the army when it saw
my ancient capital abandoned without a battle did you not notice
discouragement

seeing that his most gracious ruler was calm once more michaud also
grew calm but was not immediately ready to reply to the emperors
direct and relevant question which required a direct answer

sire will you allow me to speak frankly as befits a loyal soldier he
asked to gain time

colonel i always require it replied the emperor conceal nothing
from me i wish to know absolutely how things are

sire said michaud with a subtle scarcely perceptible smile on his
lips having now prepared a wellphrased reply sire i left the whole
army from its chiefs to the lowest soldier without exception in
desperate and agonized terror

how is that the emperor interrupted him frowning sternly would
misfortune make my russians lose heart never

michaud had only waited for this to bring out the phrase he had
prepared

sire he said with respectful playfulness they are only afraid lest
your majesty in the goodness of your heart should allow yourself to be
persuaded to make peace they are burning for the combat declared this
representative of the russian nation and to prove to your majesty by
the sacrifice of their lives how devoted they are

ah said the emperor reassured and with a kindly gleam in his eyes
he patted michaud on the shoulder you set me at ease colonel

he bent his head and was silent for some time

well then go back to the army he said drawing himself up to his
full height and addressing michaud with a gracious and majestic gesture
and tell our brave men and all my good subjects wherever you go that
when i have not a soldier left i shall put myself at the head of my
beloved nobility and my good peasants and so use the last resources of
my empire it still offers me more than my enemies suppose said the
emperor growing more and more animated but should it ever be ordained
by divine providence he continued raising to heaven his fine eyes
shining with emotion that my dynasty should cease to reign on the
throne of my ancestors then after exhausting all the means at my
command i shall let my beard grow to here he pointed halfway down his
chest and go and eat potatoes with the meanest of my peasants rather
than sign the disgrace of my country and of my beloved people whose
sacrifices i know how to appreciate

having uttered these words in an agitated voice the emperor suddenly
turned away as if to hide from michaud the tears that rose to his eyes
and went to the further end of his study having stood there a few
moments he strode back to michaud and pressed his arm below the elbow
with a vigorous movement the emperors mild and handsome face was
flushed and his eyes gleamed with resolution and anger

colonel michaud do not forget what i say to you here perhaps we may
recall it with pleasure someday napoleon or i said the emperor
touching his breast we can no longer both reign together i have
learned to know him and he will not deceive me any more

and the emperor paused with a frown

when he heard these words and saw the expression of firm resolution in
the emperors eyes michaudquoique etranger russe de coeur et dameat
that solemn moment felt himself enraptured by all that he had heard as
he used afterwards to say and gave expression to his own feelings and
those of the russian people whose representative he considered himself
to be in the following words

sire said he your majesty is at this moment signing the glory of
the nation and the salvation of europe

with an inclination of the head the emperor dismissed him





chapter iv

it is natural for us who were not living in those days to imagine that
when half russia had been conquered and the inhabitants were fleeing to
distant provinces and one levy after another was being raised for the
defense of the fatherland all russians from the greatest to the least
were solely engaged in sacrificing themselves saving their fatherland
or weeping over its downfall the tales and descriptions of that time
without exception speak only of the selfsacrifice patriotic devotion
despair grief and the heroism of the russians but it was not really
so it appears so to us because we see only the general historic
interest of that time and do not see all the personal human interests
that people had yet in reality those personal interests of the moment
so much transcend the general interests that they always prevent the
public interest from being felt or even noticed most of the people at
that time paid no attention to the general progress of events but were
guided only by their private interests and they were the very people
whose activities at that period were most useful

those who tried to understand the general course of events and to take
part in it by selfsacrifice and heroism were the most useless members
of society they saw everything upside down and all they did for the
common good turned out to be useless and foolishlike pierres and
mamonovs regiments which looted russian villages and the lint the
young ladies prepared and that never reached the wounded and so on
even those fond of intellectual talk and of expressing their feelings
who discussed russias position at the time involuntarily introduced
into their conversation either a shade of pretense and falsehood or
useless condemnation and anger directed against people accused of
actions no one could possibly be guilty of in historic events the rule
forbidding us to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge is specially
applicable only unconscious action bears fruit and he who plays a part
in an historic event never understands its significance if he tries to
realize it his efforts are fruitless

the more closely a man was engaged in the events then taking place in
russia the less did he realize their significance in petersburg and in
the provinces at a distance from moscow ladies and gentlemen in
militia uniforms wept for russia and its ancient capital and talked of
selfsacrifice and so on but in the army which retired beyond moscow
there was little talk or thought of moscow and when they caught sight
of its burned ruins no one swore to be avenged on the french but they
thought about their next pay their next quarters of matreshka the
vivandiere and like matters

as the war had caught him in the service nicholas rostóv took a close
and prolonged part in the defense of his country but did so casually
without any aim at selfsacrifice and he therefore looked at what was
going on in russia without despair and without dismally racking his
brains over it had he been asked what he thought of the state of
russia he would have said that it was not his business to think about
it that kutúzov and others were there for that purpose but that he had
heard that the regiments were to be made up to their full strength that
fighting would probably go on for a long time yet and that things being
so it was quite likely he might be in command of a regiment in a couple
of years time

as he looked at the matter in this way he learned that he was being
sent to voronezh to buy remounts for his division not only without
regret at being prevented from taking part in the coming battle but
with the greatest pleasurewhich he did not conceal and which his
comrades fully understood

a few days before the battle of borodino nicholas received the
necessary money and warrants and having sent some hussars on in
advance he set out with post horses for voronezh

only a man who has experienced itthat is has passed some months
continuously in an atmosphere of campaigning and warcan understand the
delight nicholas felt when he escaped from the region covered by the
armys foraging operations provision trains and hospitals whenfree
from soldiers wagons and the filthy traces of a camphe saw villages
with peasants and peasant women gentlemens country houses fields
where cattle were grazing posthouses with stationmasters asleep in
them he rejoiced as though seeing all this for the first time what for
a long while specially surprised and delighted him were the women young
and healthy without a dozen officers making up to each of them women
too who were pleased and flattered that a passing officer should joke
with them

in the highest spirits nicholas arrived at night at a hotel in voronezh
ordered things he had long been deprived of in camp and next day very
cleanshaven and in a fulldress uniform he had not worn for a long
time went to present himself to the authorities

the commander of the militia was a civilian general an old man who was
evidently pleased with his military designation and rank he received
nicholas brusquely imagining this to be characteristically military
and questioned him with an important air as if considering the general
progress of affairs and approving and disapproving with full right to do
so nicholas was in such good spirits that this merely amused him

from the commander of the militia he drove to the governor the governor
was a brisk little man very simple and affable he indicated the stud
farms at which nicholas might procure horses recommended to him a horse
dealer in the town and a landowner fourteen miles out of town who had
the best horses and promised to assist him in every way

you are count ilyá rostóvs son my wife was a great friend of your
mothers we are at home on thursdaystoday is thursday so please come
and see us quite informally said the governor taking leave of him

immediately on leaving the governors nicholas hired post horses and
taking his squadron quartermaster with him drove at a gallop to the
landowner fourteen miles away who had the stud everything seemed to
him pleasant and easy during that first part of his stay in voronezh
and as usually happens when a man is in a pleasant state of mind
everything went well and easily

the landowner to whom nicholas went was a bachelor an old cavalryman a
horse fancier a sportsman the possessor of some centuryold brandy and
some old hungarian wine who had a snuggery where he smoked and who
owned some splendid horses

in very few words nicholas bought seventeen picked stallions for six
thousand rublesto serve as he said as samples of his remounts after
dining and taking rather too much of the hungarian wine nicholashaving
exchanged kisses with the landowner with whom he was already on the
friendliest termsgalloped back over abominable roads in the brightest
frame of mind continually urging on the driver so as to be in time for
the governors party

when he had changed poured water over his head and scented himself
nicholas arrived at the governors rather late but with the phrase
better late than never on his lips

it was not a ball nor had dancing been announced but everyone knew
that catherine petrovna would play valses and the ecossaise on the
clavichord and that there would be dancing and so everyone had come as
to a ball

provincial life in  went on very much as usual but with this
difference that it was livelier in the towns in consequence of the
arrival of many wealthy families from moscow and as in everything that
went on in russia at that time a special recklessness was noticeable an
in for a penny in for a poundwho cares spirit and the inevitable
small talk instead of turning on the weather and mutual acquaintances
now turned on moscow the army and napoleon

the society gathered together at the governors was the best in
voronezh

there were a great many ladies and some of nicholas moscow
acquaintances but there were no men who could at all vie with the
cavalier of st george the hussar remount officer the goodnatured and
wellbred count rostóv among the men was an italian prisoner an
officer of the french army and nicholas felt that the presence of that
prisoner enhanced his own importance as a russian hero the italian was
as it were a war trophy nicholas felt this it seemed to him that
everyone regarded the italian in the same light and he treated him
cordially though with dignity and restraint

as soon as nicholas entered in his hussar uniform diffusing around him
a fragrance of perfume and wine and had uttered the words better late
than never and heard them repeated several times by others people
clustered around him all eyes turned on him and he felt at once that
he had entered into his proper position in the provincethat of a
universal favorite a very pleasant position and intoxicatingly so
after his long privations at posting stations at inns and in the
landowners snuggery maidservants had been flattered by his notice and
here too at the governors party there were as it seemed to nicholas
an inexhaustible number of pretty young women married and unmarried
impatiently awaiting his notice the women and girls flirted with him
and from the first day the people concerned themselves to get this
fine young daredevil of an hussar married and settled down among these
was the governors wife herself who welcomed rostóv as a near relative
and called him nicholas

catherine petrovna did actually play valses and the ecossaise and
dancing began in which nicholas still further captivated the provincial
society by his agility his particularly free manner of dancing even
surprised them all nicholas was himself rather surprised at the way he
danced that evening he had never danced like that in moscow and would
even have considered such a very free and easy manner improper and in
bad form but here he felt it incumbent on him to astonish them all by
something unusual something they would have to accept as the regular
thing in the capital though new to them in the provinces

all the evening nicholas paid attention to a blueeyed plump and
pleasing little blonde the wife of one of the provincial officials
with the naïve conviction of young men in a merry mood that other mens
wives were created for them rostóv did not leave the ladys side and
treated her husband in a friendly and conspiratorial style as if
without speaking of it they knew how capitally nicholas and the lady
would get on together the husband however did not seem to share that
conviction and tried to behave morosely with rostóv but the latters
goodnatured naïvete was so boundless that sometimes even he
involuntarily yielded to nicholas good humor toward the end of the
evening however as the wifes face grew more flushed and animated the
husbands became more and more melancholy and solemn as though there
were but a given amount of animation between them and as the wifes
share increased the husbands diminished





chapter v

nicholas sat leaning slightly forward in an armchair bending closely
over the blonde lady and paying her mythological compliments with a
smile that never left his face jauntily shifting the position of his
legs in their tight riding breeches diffusing an odor of perfume and
admiring his partner himself and the fine outlines of his legs in
their wellfitting hessian boots nicholas told the blonde lady that he
wished to run away with a certain lady here in voronezh

which lady

a charming lady a divine one her eyes nicholas looked at his
partner are blue her mouth coral and ivory her figure he glanced
at her shoulders like dianas

the husband came up and sullenly asked his wife what she was talking
about

ah nikita ivanych cried nicholas rising politely and as if wishing
nikita ivanych to share his joke he began to tell him of his intention
to elope with a blonde lady

the husband smiled gloomily the wife gaily the governors goodnatured
wife came up with a look of disapproval

anna ignatyevna wants to see you nicholas said she pronouncing the
name so that nicholas at once understood that anna ignatyevna was a very
important person come nicholas you know you let me call you so

oh yes aunt who is she

anna ignatyevna malvintseva she has heard from her niece how you
rescued her can you guess

i rescued such a lot of them said nicholas

her niece princess bolkónskaya she is here in voronezh with her aunt
oho how you blush why are

not a bit please dont aunt

very well very well oh what a fellow you are

the governors wife led him up to a tall and very stout old lady with a
blue headdress who had just finished her game of cards with the most
important personages of the town this was malvintseva princess marys
aunt on her mothers side a rich childless widow who always lived in
voronezh when rostóv approached her she was standing settling up for
the game she looked at him and screwing up her eyes sternly continued
to upbraid the general who had won from her

very pleased mon cher she then said holding out her hand to
nicholas pray come and see me

after a few words about princess mary and her late father whom
malvintseva had evidently not liked and having asked what nicholas knew
of prince andrew who also was evidently no favorite of hers the
important old lady dismissed nicholas after repeating her invitation to
come to see her

nicholas promised to come and blushed again as he bowed at the mention
of princess mary he experienced a feeling of shyness and even of fear
which he himself did not understand

when he had parted from malvintseva nicholas wished to return to the
dancing but the governors little wife placed her plump hand on his
sleeve and saying that she wanted to have a talk with him led him to
her sitting room from which those who were there immediately withdrew
so as not to be in her way

do you know dear boy began the governors wife with a serious
expression on her kind little face that really would be the match for
you would you like me to arrange it

whom do you mean aunt asked nicholas

i will make a match for you with the princess catherine petrovna
speaks of lily but i say nothe princess do you want me to do it i
am sure your mother will be grateful to me what a charming girl she is
really and she is not at all so plain either

not at all replied nicholas as if offended at the idea as befits a
soldier aunt i dont force myself on anyone or refuse anything he
said before he had time to consider what he was saying

well then remember this is not a joke

of course not

yes yes the governors wife said as if talking to herself but my
dear boy among other things you are too attentive to the other the
blonde one is sorry for the husband really

oh no we are good friends with him said nicholas in the simplicity
of his heart it did not enter his head that a pastime so pleasant to
himself might not be pleasant to someone else

but what nonsense i have been saying to the governors wife thought
nicholas suddenly at supper she will really begin to arrange a
match and sónya and on taking leave of the governors wife when
she again smilingly said to him well then remember he drew her
aside

but see here to tell the truth aunt

what is it my dear come lets sit down here said she

nicholas suddenly felt a desire and need to tell his most intimate
thoughts which he would not have told to his mother his sister or his
friend to this woman who was almost a stranger when he afterwards
recalled that impulse to unsolicited and inexplicable frankness which
had very important results for him it seemed to himas it seems to
everyone in such casesthat it was merely some silly whim that seized
him yet that burst of frankness together with other trifling events
had immense consequences for him and for all his family

you see aunt mamma has long wanted me to marry an heiress but the
very idea of marrying for money is repugnant to me

oh yes i understand said the governors wife

but princess bolkónskayathats another matter i will tell you the
truth in the first place i like her very much i feel drawn to her and
then after i met her under such circumstancesso strangely the idea
often occurred to me this is fate especially if you remember that
mamma had long been thinking of it but i had never happened to meet her
before somehow it had always happened that we did not meet and as long
as my sister natásha was engaged to her brother it was of course out of
the question for me to think of marrying her and it must needs happen
that i should meet her just when natáshas engagement had been broken
off and then everything so you see i never told this to anyone
and never will only to you

the governors wife pressed his elbow gratefully

you know sónya my cousin i love her and promised to marry her and
will do so so you see there can be no question about said nicholas
incoherently and blushing

my dear boy what a way to look at it you know sónya has nothing and
you yourself say your papas affairs are in a very bad way and what
about your mother it would kill her thats one thing and what sort of
life would it be for sónyaif shes a girl with a heart your mother in
despair and you all ruined no my dear you and sónya ought to
understand that

nicholas remained silent it comforted him to hear these arguments

all the same aunt it is impossible he rejoined with a sigh after a
short pause besides would the princess have me and besides she is
now in mourning how can one think of it

always a right way of doing things replied the governors wife

little hand





chapter vi

on reaching moscow after her meeting with rostóv princess mary had
found her nephew there with his tutor and a letter from prince andrew
giving her instructions how to get to her aunt malvintseva at voronezh
that feeling akin to temptation which had tormented her during her
fathers illness since his death and especially since her meeting with
rostóv was smothered by arrangements for the journey anxiety about her
brother settling in a new house meeting new people and attending to
her nephews education she was sad now after a month passed in quiet
surroundings she felt more and more deeply the loss of her father which
was associated in her mind with the ruin of russia she was agitated and
incessantly tortured by the thought of the dangers to which her brother
the only intimate person now remaining to her was exposed she was
worried too about her nephews education for which she had always felt
herself incompetent but in the depths of her soul she felt at peacea
peace arising from consciousness of having stifled those personal dreams
and hopes that had been on the point of awakening within her and were
related to her meeting with rostóv

the day after her party the governors wife came to see malvintseva and
after discussing her plan with the aunt remarked that though under
present circumstances a formal betrothal was of course not to be
thought of all the same the young people might be brought together and
could get to know one another malvintseva expressed approval and the
governors wife began to speak of rostóv in marys presence praising
him and telling how he had blushed when princess marys name was
mentioned but princess mary experienced a painful rather than a joyful
feelingher mental tranquillity was destroyed and desires doubts
selfreproach and hopes reawoke

during the two days that elapsed before rostóv called princess mary
continually thought of how she ought to behave to him first she decided
not to come to the drawing room when he called to see her auntthat it
would not be proper for her in her deep mourning to receive visitors
then she thought this would be rude after what he had done for her then
it occurred to her that her aunt and the governors wife had intentions
concerning herself and rostóvtheir looks and words at times seemed to
confirm this suppositionthen she told herself that only she with her
sinful nature could think this of them they could not forget that
situated as she was while still wearing deep mourning such matchmaking
would be an insult to her and to her fathers memory assuming that she
did go down to see him princess mary imagined the words he would say to
her and what she would say to him and these words sometimes seemed
undeservedly cold and then to mean too much more than anything she
feared lest the confusion she felt might overwhelm her and betray her as
soon as she saw him

but when on sunday after church the footman announced in the drawing
room that count rostóv had called the princess showed no confusion
only a slight blush suffused her cheeks and her eyes lit up with a new
and radiant light

you have met him aunt said she in a calm voice unable herself to
understand that she could be outwardly so calm and natural

when rostóv entered the room the princess dropped her eyes for an
instant as if to give the visitor time to greet her aunt and then just
as nicholas turned to her she raised her head and met his look with
shining eyes with a movement full of dignity and grace she half rose
with a smile of pleasure held out her slender delicate hand to him
and began to speak in a voice in which for the first time new deep
womanly notes vibrated mademoiselle bourienne who was in the drawing
room looked at princess mary in bewildered surprise herself a
consummate coquette she could not have maneuvered better on meeting a
man she wished to attract

either black is particularly becoming to her or she really has greatly
improved without my having noticed it and above all what tact and
grace thought mademoiselle bourienne

had princess mary been capable of reflection at that moment she would
have been more surprised than mademoiselle bourienne at the change that
had taken place in herself from the moment she recognized that dear
loved face a new life force took possession of her and compelled her to
speak and act apart from her own will from the time rostóv entered her
face became suddenly transformed it was as if a light had been kindled
in a carved and painted lantern and the intricate skillful artistic
work on its sides that previously seemed dark coarse and meaningless
was suddenly shown up in unexpected and striking beauty for the first
time all that pure spiritual inward travail through which she had
lived appeared on the surface all her inward labor her dissatisfaction
with herself her sufferings her strivings after goodness her
meekness love and selfsacrificeall this now shone in those radiant
eyes in her delicate smile and in every trait of her gentle face

rostóv saw all this as clearly as if he had known her whole life he
felt that the being before him was quite different from and better
than anyone he had met before and above all better than himself

their conversation was very simple and unimportant they spoke of the
war and like everyone else unconsciously exaggerated their sorrow about
it they spoke of their last meetingnicholas trying to change the
subjectthey talked of the governors kind wife of nicholas relations
and of princess marys

she did not talk about her brother diverting the conversation as soon
as her aunt mentioned andrew evidently she could speak of russias
misfortunes with a certain artificiality but her brother was too near
her heart and she neither could nor would speak lightly of him nicholas
noticed this as he noticed every shade of princess marys character
with an observation unusual to him and everything confirmed his
conviction that she was a quite unusual and extraordinary being
nicholas blushed and was confused when people spoke to him about the
princess as she did when he was mentioned and even when he thought of
her but in her presence he felt quite at ease and said not at all what
he had prepared but what quite appropriately occurred to him at the
moment

when a pause occurred during his short visit nicholas as is usual when
there are children turned to prince andrews little son caressing him
and asking whether he would like to be an hussar he took the boy on his
knee played with him and looked round at princess mary with a
softened happy timid look she watched the boy she loved in the arms of
the man she loved nicholas also noticed that look and as if
understanding it flushed with pleasure and began to kiss the boy with
good natured playfulness

as she was in mourning princess mary did not go out into society and
nicholas did not think it the proper thing to visit her again but all
the same the governors wife went on with her matchmaking passing on to
nicholas the flattering things princess mary said of him and vice versa
and insisting on his declaring himself to princess mary for this
purpose she arranged a meeting between the young people at the bishops
house before mass

though rostóv told the governors wife that he would not make any
declaration to princess mary he promised to go

as at tilsit rostóv had not allowed himself to doubt that what everybody
considered right was right so now after a short but sincere struggle
between his effort to arrange his life by his own sense of justice and
in obedient submission to circumstances he chose the latter and yielded
to the power he felt irresistibly carrying him he knew not where he
knew that after his promise to sónya it would be what he deemed base to
declare his feelings to princess mary and he knew that he would never
act basely but he also knew or rather felt at the bottom of his heart
that by resigning himself now to the force of circumstances and to those
who were guiding him he was not only doing nothing wrong but was doing
something very importantmore important than anything he had ever done
in his life

after meeting princess mary though the course of his life went on
externally as before all his former amusements lost their charm for him
and he often thought about her but he never thought about her as he had
thought of all the young ladies without exception whom he had met in
society nor as he had for a long time and at one time rapturously
thought about sónya he had pictured each of those young ladies as
almost all honesthearted young men do that is as a possible wife
adapting her in his imagination to all the conditions of married life a
white dressing gown his wife at the tea table his wifes carriage
little ones mamma and papa their relations to her and so onand these
pictures of the future had given him pleasure but with princess mary
to whom they were trying to get him engaged he could never picture
anything of future married life if he tried his pictures seemed
incongruous and false it made him afraid





chapter vii

the dreadful news of the battle of borodino of our losses in killed and
wounded and the still more terrible news of the loss of moscow reached
voronezh in the middle of september princess mary having learned of
her brothers wound only from the gazette and having no definite news of
him prepared so nicholas heard he had not seen her again himself to
set off in search of prince andrew

when he received the news of the battle of borodino and the abandonment
of moscow rostóv was not seized with despair anger the desire for
vengeance or any feeling of that kind but everything in voronezh
suddenly seemed to him dull and tiresome and he experienced an
indefinite feeling of shame and awkwardness the conversations he heard
seemed to him insincere he did not know how to judge all these affairs
and felt that only in the regiment would everything again become clear
to him he made haste to finish buying the horses and often became
unreasonably angry with his servant and squadron quartermaster

a few days before his departure a special thanksgiving at which
nicholas was present was held in the cathedral for the russian victory
he stood a little behind the governor and held himself with military
decorum through the service meditating on a great variety of subjects
when the service was over the governors wife beckoned him to her

have you seen the princess she asked indicating with a movement of
her head a lady standing on the opposite side beyond the choir

nicholas immediately recognized princess mary not so much by the profile
he saw under her bonnet as by the feeling of solicitude timidity and
pity that immediately overcame him princess mary evidently engrossed
by her thoughts was crossing herself for the last time before leaving
the church

nicholas looked at her face with surprise it was the same face he had
seen before there was the same general expression of refined inner
spiritual labor but now it was quite differently lit up there was a
pathetic expression of sorrow prayer and hope in it as had occurred
before when she was present nicholas went up to her without waiting to
be prompted by the governors wife and not asking himself whether or not
it was right and proper to address her here in church and told her he
had heard of her trouble and sympathized with his whole soul as soon as
she heard his voice a vivid glow kindled in her face lighting up both
her sorrow and her joy

there is one thing i wanted to tell you princess said rostóv it is
that if your brother prince andrew nikolievich were not living it
would have been at once announced in the gazette as he is a colonel

the princess looked at him not grasping what he was saying but cheered
by the expression of regretful sympathy on his face

and i have known so many cases of a splinter wound the gazette said
it was a shell either proving fatal at once or being very slight
continued nicholas we must hope for the best and i am sure

princess mary interrupted him

oh that would be so dread she began and prevented by agitation
from finishing she bent her head with a movement as graceful as
everything she did in his presence and looking up at him gratefully
went out following her aunt

that evening nicholas did not go out but stayed at home to settle some
accounts with the horse dealers when he had finished that business it
was already too late to go anywhere but still too early to go to bed
and for a long time he paced up and down the room reflecting on his
life a thing he rarely did

princess mary had made an agreeable impression on him when he had met
her in smolensk province his having encountered her in such exceptional
circumstances and his mother having at one time mentioned her to him as
a good match had drawn his particular attention to her when he met her
again in voronezh the impression she made on him was not merely pleasing
but powerful nicholas had been struck by the peculiar moral beauty he
observed in her at this time he was however preparing to go away and
it had not entered his head to regret that he was thus depriving himself
of chances of meeting her but that days encounter in church had he
felt sunk deeper than was desirable for his peace of mind that pale
sad refined face that radiant look those gentle graceful gestures
and especially the deep and tender sorrow expressed in all her features
agitated him and evoked his sympathy in men rostóv could not bear to
see the expression of a higher spiritual life that was why he did not
like prince andrew and he referred to it contemptuously as philosophy
and dreaminess but in princess mary that very sorrow which revealed the
depth of a whole spiritual world foreign to him was an irresistible
attraction

she must be a wonderful woman a real angel he said to himself why
am i not free why was i in such a hurry with sónya and he
involuntarily compared the two the lack of spirituality in the one and
the abundance of it in the othera spirituality he himself lacked and
therefore valued most highly he tried to picture what would happen were
he free how he would propose to her and how she would become his wife
but no he could not imagine that he felt awed and no clear picture
presented itself to his mind he had long ago pictured to himself a
future with sónya and that was all clear and simple just because it had
all been thought out and he knew all there was in sónya but it was
impossible to picture a future with princess mary because he did not
understand her but simply loved her

reveries about sónya had had something merry and playful in them but to
dream of princess mary was always difficult and a little frightening

how she prayed he thought it was plain that her whole soul was in
her prayer yes that was the prayer that moves mountains and i am sure
her prayer will be answered why dont i pray for what i want he
suddenly thought what do i want to be free released from sónya
she was right he thought remembering what the governors wife had
said nothing but misfortune can come of marrying sónya muddles grief
for mamma business difficulties muddles terrible muddles
besides i dont love hernot as i should o god release me from this
dreadful inextricable position he suddenly began to pray yes
prayer can move mountains but one must have faith and not pray as
natásha and i used to as children that the snow might turn into
sugarand then run out into the yard to see whether it had done so no
but i am not praying for trifles now he thought as he put his pipe
down in a corner and folding his hands placed himself before the icon
softened by memories of princess mary he began to pray as he had not
done for a long time tears were in his eyes and in his throat when the
door opened and lavrushka came in with some papers

blockhead why do you come in without being called cried nicholas
quickly changing his attitude

from the governor said lavrushka in a sleepy voice a courier has
arrived and theres a letter for you

well all right thanks you can go

nicholas took the two letters one of which was from his mother and the
other from sónya he recognized them by the handwriting and opened
sónyas first he had read only a few lines when he turned pale and his
eyes opened wide with fear and joy

no its not possible he cried aloud

unable to sit still he paced up and down the room holding the letter and
reading it he glanced through it then read it again and then again
and standing still in the middle of the room he raised his shoulders
stretching out his hands with his mouth wide open and his eyes fixed
what he had just been praying for with confidence that god would hear
him had come to pass but nicholas was as much astonished as if it were
something extraordinary and unexpected and as if the very fact that it
had happened so quickly proved that it had not come from god to whom he
had prayed but by some ordinary coincidence

this unexpected and as it seemed to nicholas quite voluntary letter
from sónya freed him from the knot that fettered him and from which
there had seemed no escape she wrote that the last unfortunate
eventsthe loss of almost the whole of the rostóvs moscow propertyand
the countess repeatedly expressed wish that nicholas should marry
princess bolkónskaya together with his silence and coldness of late
had all combined to make her decide to release him from his promise and
set him completely free

it would be too painful to me to think that i might be a cause of sorrow
or discord in the family that has been so good to me she wrote and my
love has no aim but the happiness of those i love so nicholas i beg
you to consider yourself free and to be assured that in spite of
everything no one can love you more than does

your sónya

both letters were written from troitsa the other from the countess
described their last days in moscow their departure the fire and the
destruction of all their property in this letter the countess also
mentioned that prince andrew was among the wounded traveling with them
his state was very critical but the doctor said there was now more
hope sónya and natásha were nursing him

next day nicholas took his mothers letter and went to see princess
mary neither he nor she said a word about what natásha nursing him
might mean but thanks to this letter nicholas suddenly became almost as
intimate with the princess as if they were relations

the following day he saw princess mary off on her journey to yaroslavl
and a few days later left to rejoin his regiment





chapter viii

sónyas letter written from troitsa which had come as an answer to
nicholas prayer was prompted by this the thought of getting nicholas
married to an heiress occupied the old countess mind more and more she
knew that sónya was the chief obstacle to this happening and sónyas
life in the countess house had grown harder and harder especially
after they had received a letter from nicholas telling of his meeting
with princess mary in bogucharovo the countess let no occasion slip of
making humiliating or cruel allusions to sónya

but a few days before they left moscow moved and excited by all that
was going on she called sónya to her and instead of reproaching and
making demands on her tearfully implored her to sacrifice herself and
repay all that the family had done for her by breaking off her
engagement with nicholas

i shall not be at peace till you promise me this

sónya burst into hysterical tears and replied through her sobs that she
would do anything and was prepared for anything but gave no actual
promise and could not bring herself to decide to do what was demanded of
her she must sacrifice herself for the family that had reared and
brought her up to sacrifice herself for others was sónyas habit her
position in the house was such that only by sacrifice could she show her
worth and she was accustomed to this and loved doing it but in all her
former acts of selfsacrifice she had been happily conscious that they
raised her in her own esteem and in that of others and so made her more
worthy of nicholas whom she loved more than anything in the world but
now they wanted her to sacrifice the very thing that constituted the
whole reward for her selfsacrifice and the whole meaning of her life
and for the first time she felt bitterness against those who had been
her benefactors only to torture her the more painfully she felt jealous
of natásha who had never experienced anything of this sort had never
needed to sacrifice herself but made others sacrifice themselves for
her and yet was beloved by everybody and for the first time sónya felt
that out of her pure quiet love for nicholas a passionate feeling was
beginning to grow up which was stronger than principle virtue or
religion under the influence of this feeling sónya whose life of
dependence had taught her involuntarily to be secretive having answered
the countess in vague general terms avoided talking with her and
resolved to wait till she should see nicholas not in order to set him
free but on the contrary at that meeting to bind him to her forever

the bustle and terror of the rostóvs last days in moscow stifled the
gloomy thoughts that oppressed sónya she was glad to find escape from
them in practical activity but when she heard of prince andrews
presence in their house despite her sincere pity for him and for
natásha she was seized by a joyful and superstitious feeling that god
did not intend her to be separated from nicholas she knew that natásha
loved no one but prince andrew and had never ceased to love him she
knew that being thrown together again under such terrible circumstances
they would again fall in love with one another and that nicholas would
then not be able to marry princess mary as they would be within the
prohibited degrees of affinity despite all the terror of what had
happened during those last days and during the first days of their
journey this feeling that providence was intervening in her personal
affairs cheered sónya

at the troitsa monastery the rostóvs first broke their journey for a
whole day

three large rooms were assigned to them in the monastery hostelry one
of which was occupied by prince andrew the wounded man was much better
that day and natásha was sitting with him in the next room sat the
count and countess respectfully conversing with the prior who was
calling on them as old acquaintances and benefactors of the monastery
sónya was there too tormented by curiosity as to what prince andrew and
natásha were talking about she heard the sound of their voices through
the door that door opened and natásha came out looking excited not
noticing the monk who had risen to greet her and was drawing back the
wide sleeve on his right arm she went up to sónya and took her hand

natásha what are you about come here said the countess

natásha went up to the monk for his blessing and he advised her to pray
for aid to god and his saint

as soon as the prior withdrew natásha took her friend by the hand and
went with her into the unoccupied room

sónya will he live she asked sónya how happy i am and how
unhappy sónya dovey everything is as it used to be if only he
lives he cannot because because of and natásha burst into
tears

yes i knew it thank god murmured sónya he will live

sónya was not less agitated than her friend by the latters fear and
grief and by her own personal feelings which she shared with no one
sobbing she kissed and comforted natásha if only he lives she
thought having wept talked and wiped away their tears the two
friends went together to prince andrews door natásha opened it
cautiously and glanced into the room sónya standing beside her at the
halfopen door

prince andrew was lying raised high on three pillows his pale face was
calm his eyes closed and they could see his regular breathing

o natásha sónya suddenly almost screamed catching her companions
arm and stepping back from the door

what what is it asked natásha

its that that said sónya with a white face and trembling lips

natásha softly closed the door and went with sónya to the window not
yet understanding what the latter was telling her

you remember said sónya with a solemn and frightened expression you
remember when i looked in the mirror for you at otradnoe at
christmas do you remember what i saw

yes yes cried natásha opening her eyes wide and vaguely recalling
that sónya had told her something about prince andrew whom she had seen
lying down

you remember sónya went on i saw it then and told everybody you
and dunyasha i saw him lying on a bed said she making a gesture with
her hand and a lifted finger at each detail and that he had his eyes
closed and was covered just with a pink quilt and that his hands were
folded she concluded convincing herself that the details she had just
seen were exactly what she had seen in the mirror

she had in fact seen nothing then but had mentioned the first thing that
came into her head but what she had invented then seemed to her now as
real as any other recollection she not only remembered what she had
then saidthat he turned to look at her and smiled and was covered with
something redbut was firmly convinced that she had then seen and said
that he was covered with a pink quilt and that his eyes were closed

yes yes it really was pink cried natásha who now thought she too
remembered the word pink being used and saw in this the most
extraordinary and mysterious part of the prediction

but what does it mean she added meditatively

oh i dont know it is all so strange replied sónya clutching at
her head

a few minutes later prince andrew rang and natásha went to him but
sónya feeling unusually excited and touched remained at the window
thinking about the strangeness of what had occurred

they had an opportunity that day to send letters to the army and the
countess was writing to her son

sónya said the countess raising her eyes from her letter as her
niece passed sónya wont you write to nicholas she spoke in a soft
tremulous voice and in the weary eyes that looked over her spectacles
sónya read all that the countess meant to convey with these words those
eyes expressed entreaty shame at having to ask fear of a refusal and
readiness for relentless hatred in case of such refusal

sónya went up to the countess and kneeling down kissed her hand

yes mamma i will write said she

sónya was softened excited and touched by all that had occurred that
day especially by the mysterious fulfillment she had just seen of her
vision now that she knew that the renewal of natáshas relations with
prince andrew would prevent nicholas from marrying princess mary she
was joyfully conscious of a return of that selfsacrificing spirit in
which she was accustomed to live and loved to live so with a joyful
consciousness of performing a magnanimous deedinterrupted several times
by the tears that dimmed her velvety black eyesshe wrote that touching
letter the arrival of which had so amazed nicholas





chapter ix

the officer and soldiers who had arrested pierre treated him with
hostility but yet with respect in the guardhouse to which he was taken
in their attitude toward him could still be felt both uncertainty as to
who he might beperhaps a very important personand hostility as a
result of their recent personal conflict with him

but when the guard was relieved next morning pierre felt that for the
new guardboth officers and menhe was not as interesting as he had been
to his captors and in fact the guard of the second day did not
recognize in this big stout man in a peasant coat the vigorous person
who had fought so desperately with the marauder and the convoy and had
uttered those solemn words about saving a child they saw in him only
no  of the captured russians arrested and detained for some reason
by order of the higher command if they noticed anything remarkable
about pierre it was only his unabashed meditative concentration and
thoughtfulness and the way he spoke french which struck them as
surprisingly good in spite of this he was placed that day with the
other arrested suspects as the separate room he had occupied was
required by an officer

all the russians confined with pierre were men of the lowest class and
recognizing him as a gentleman they all avoided him more especially as
he spoke french pierre felt sad at hearing them making fun of him

that evening he learned that all these prisoners he probably among
them were to be tried for incendiarism on the third day he was taken
with the others to a house where a french general with a white mustache
sat with two colonels and other frenchmen with scarves on their arms
with the precision and definiteness customary in addressing prisoners
and which is supposed to preclude human frailty pierre like the others
was questioned as to who he was where he had been with what object
and so on

these questions like questions put at trials generally left the
essence of the matter aside shut out the possibility of that essences
being revealed and were designed only to form a channel through which
the judges wished the answers of the accused to flow so as to lead to
the desired result namely a conviction as soon as pierre began to say
anything that did not fit in with that aim the channel was removed and
the water could flow to waste pierre felt moreover what the accused
always feel at their trial perplexity as to why these questions were
put to him he had a feeling that it was only out of condescension or a
kind of civility that this device of placing a channel was employed he
knew he was in these mens power that only by force had they brought
him there that force alone gave them the right to demand answers to
their questions and that the sole object of that assembly was to
inculpate him and so as they had the power and wish to inculpate him
this expedient of an inquiry and trial seemed unnecessary it was
evident that any answer would lead to conviction when asked what he was
doing when he was arrested pierre replied in a rather tragic manner
that he was restoring to its parents a child he had saved from the
flames why had he fought the marauder pierre answered that he was
protecting a woman and that to protect a woman who was being insulted
was the duty of every man that they interrupted him for this was
not to the point why was he in the yard of a burning house where
witnesses had seen him he replied that he had gone out to see what was
happening in moscow again they interrupted him they had not asked
where he was going but why he was found near the fire who was he they
asked repeating their first question which he had declined to answer
again he replied that he could not answer it

put that down thats bad very bad sternly remarked the general
with the white mustache and red flushed face

on the fourth day fires broke out on the zubovski rampart

pierre and thirteen others were moved to the coach house of a merchants
house near the crimean bridge on his way through the streets pierre
felt stifled by the smoke which seemed to hang over the whole city
fires were visible on all sides he did not then realize the
significance of the burning of moscow and looked at the fires with
horror

he passed four days in the coach house near the crimean bridge and
during that time learned from the talk of the french soldiers that all
those confined there were awaiting a decision which might come any day
from the marshal what marshal this was pierre could not learn from the
soldiers evidently for them the marshal represented a very high and
rather mysterious power

these first days before the eighth of september when the prisoners were
had up for a second examination were the hardest of all for pierre





chapter x

on the eighth of september an officera very important one judging by
the respect the guards showed himentered the coach house where the
prisoners were this officer probably someone on the staff was holding
a paper in his hand and called over all the russians there naming
pierre as the man who does not give his name glancing indolently and
indifferently at all the prisoners he ordered the officer in charge to
have them decently dressed and tidied up before taking them to the
marshal an hour later a squad of soldiers arrived and pierre with
thirteen others was led to the virgins field it was a fine day sunny
after rain and the air was unusually pure the smoke did not hang low
as on the day when pierre had been taken from the guardhouse on the
zubovski rampart but rose through the pure air in columns no flames
were seen but columns of smoke rose on all sides and all moscow as far
as pierre could see was one vast charred ruin on all sides there were
waste spaces with only stoves and chimney stacks still standing and
here and there the blackened walls of some brick houses pierre gazed at
the ruins and did not recognize districts he had known well here and
there he could see churches that had not been burned the kremlin which
was not destroyed gleamed white in the distance with its towers and the
belfry of ivan the great the domes of the new convent of the virgin
glittered brightly and its bells were ringing particularly clearly
these bells reminded pierre that it was sunday and the feast of the
nativity of the virgin but there seemed to be no one to celebrate this
holiday everywhere were blackened ruins and the few russians to be
seen were tattered and frightened people who tried to hide when they saw
the french

it was plain that the russian nest was ruined and destroyed but in
place of the russian order of life that had been destroyed pierre
unconsciously felt that a quite different firm french order had been
established over this ruined nest he felt this in the looks of the
soldiers who marching in regular ranks briskly and gaily were
escorting him and the other criminals he felt it in the looks of an
important french official in a carriage and pair driven by a soldier
whom they met on the way he felt it in the merry sounds of regimental
music he heard from the left side of the field and felt and realized it
especially from the list of prisoners the french officer had read out
when he came that morning pierre had been taken by one set of soldiers
and led first to one and then to another place with dozens of other men
and it seemed that they might have forgotten him or confused him with
the others but no the answers he had given when questioned had come
back to him in his designation as the man who does not give his name
and under that appellation which to pierre seemed terrible they were
now leading him somewhere with unhesitating assurance on their faces
that he and all the other prisoners were exactly the ones they wanted
and that they were being taken to the proper place pierre felt himself
to be an insignificant chip fallen among the wheels of a machine whose
action he did not understand but which was working well

he and the other prisoners were taken to the right side of the virgins
field to a large white house with an immense garden not far from the
convent this was prince shcherbitovs house where pierre had often
been in other days and which as he learned from the talk of the
soldiers was now occupied by the marshal the duke of eckmuhl davout

they were taken to the entrance and led into the house one by one
pierre was the sixth to enter he was conducted through a glass gallery
an anteroom and a hall which were familiar to him into a long low
study at the door of which stood an adjutant

davout spectacles on nose sat bent over a table at the further end of
the room pierre went close up to him but davout evidently consulting
a paper that lay before him did not look up without raising his eyes
he said in a low voice

who are you

pierre was silent because he was incapable of uttering a word to him
davout was not merely a french general but a man notorious for his
cruelty looking at his cold face as he sat like a stern schoolmaster
who was prepared to wait awhile for an answer pierre felt that every
instant of delay might cost him his life but he did not know what to
say he did not venture to repeat what he had said at his first
examination yet to disclose his rank and position was dangerous and
embarrassing so he was silent but before he had decided what to do
davout raised his head pushed his spectacles back on his forehead
screwed up his eyes and looked intently at him

i know that man he said in a cold measured tone evidently
calculated to frighten pierre

the chill that had been running down pierres back now seized his head
as in a vise

you cannot know me general i have never seen you

he is a russian spy davout interrupted addressing another general
who was present but whom pierre had not noticed

davout turned away with an unexpected reverberation in his voice pierre
rapidly began

no monseigneur he said suddenly remembering that davout was a duke
no monseigneur you cannot have known me i am a militia officer and
have not quitted moscow

your name asked davout

bezúkhov

what proof have i that you are not lying

monseigneur exclaimed pierre not in an offended but in a pleading
voice

davout looked up and gazed intently at him for some seconds they looked
at one another and that look saved pierre apart from conditions of war
and law that look established human relations between the two men at
that moment an immense number of things passed dimly through both their
minds and they realized that they were both children of humanity and
were brothers

at the first glance when davout had only raised his head from the
papers where human affairs and lives were indicated by numbers pierre
was merely a circumstance and davout could have shot him without
burdening his conscience with an evil deed but now he saw in him a
human being he reflected for a moment

how can you show me that you are telling the truth said davout
coldly

pierre remembered ramballe and named him and his regiment and the
street where the house was

you are not what you say returned davout

in a trembling faltering voice pierre began adducing proofs of the
truth of his statements

but at that moment an adjutant entered and reported something to davout

davout brightened up at the news the adjutant brought and began
buttoning up his uniform it seemed that he had quite forgotten pierre

when the adjutant reminded him of the prisoner he jerked his head in
pierres direction with a frown and ordered him to be led away but
where they were to take him pierre did not know back to the coach house
or to the place of execution his companions had pointed out to him as
they crossed the virgins field

he turned his head and saw that the adjutant was putting another
question to davout

yes of course replied davout but what this yes meant pierre did
not know

pierre could not afterwards remember how he went whether it was far or
in which direction his faculties were quite numbed he was stupefied
and noticing nothing around him went on moving his legs as the others
did till they all stopped and he stopped too the only thought in his
mind at that time was who was it that had really sentenced him to
death not the men on the commission that had first examined himnot one
of them wished to or evidently could have done it it was not davout
who had looked at him in so human a way in another moment davout would
have realized that he was doing wrong but just then the adjutant had
come in and interrupted him the adjutant also had evidently had no
evil intent though he might have refrained from coming in then who was
executing him killing him depriving him of lifehim pierre with all
his memories aspirations hopes and thoughts who was doing this and
pierre felt that it was no one

it was a systema concurrence of circumstances

a system of some sort was killing himpierredepriving him of life of
everything annihilating him





chapter xi

from prince shcherbatovs house the prisoners were led straight down the
virgins field to the left of the nunnery as far as a kitchen garden
in which a post had been set up beyond that post a fresh pit had been
dug in the ground and near the post and the pit a large crowd stood in
a semicircle the crowd consisted of a few russians and many of
napoleons soldiers who were not on dutygermans italians and
frenchmen in a variety of uniforms to the right and left of the post
stood rows of french troops in blue uniforms with red epaulets and high
boots and shakos

the prisoners were placed in a certain order according to the list
pierre was sixth and were led to the post several drums suddenly
began to beat on both sides of them and at that sound pierre felt as if
part of his soul had been torn away he lost the power of thinking or
understanding he could only hear and see and he had only one wishthat
the frightful thing that had to happen should happen quickly pierre
looked round at his fellow prisoners and scrutinized them

the two first were convicts with shaven heads one was tall and thin
the other dark shaggy and sinewy with a flat nose the third was a
domestic serf about fortyfive years old with grizzled hair and a
plump wellnourished body the fourth was a peasant a very handsome
man with a broad lightbrown beard and black eyes the fifth was a
factory hand a thin sallowfaced lad of eighteen in a loose coat

pierre heard the french consulting whether to shoot them separately or
two at a time in couples replied the officer in command in a calm
voice there was a stir in the ranks of the soldiers and it was evident
that they were all hurryingnot as men hurry to do something they
understand but as people hurry to finish a necessary but unpleasant and
incomprehensible task

a french official wearing a scarf came up to the right of the row of
prisoners and read out the sentence in russian and in french

then two pairs of frenchmen approached the criminals and at the
officers command took the two convicts who stood first in the row the
convicts stopped when they reached the post and while sacks were being
brought looked dumbly around as a wounded beast looks at an approaching
huntsman one crossed himself continually the other scratched his back
and made a movement of the lips resembling a smile with hurried hands
the soldiers blindfolded them drawing the sacks over their heads and
bound them to the post

twelve sharpshooters with muskets stepped out of the ranks with a firm
regular tread and halted eight paces from the post pierre turned away
to avoid seeing what was going to happen suddenly a crackling rolling
noise was heard which seemed to him louder than the most terrific
thunder and he looked round there was some smoke and the frenchmen
were doing something near the pit with pale faces and trembling hands
two more prisoners were led up in the same way and with similar looks
these two glanced vainly at the onlookers with only a silent appeal for
protection in their eyes evidently unable to understand or believe what
was going to happen to them they could not believe it because they
alone knew what their life meant to them and so they neither understood
nor believed that it could be taken from them

again pierre did not wish to look and again turned away but again the
sound as of a frightful explosion struck his ear and at the same moment
he saw smoke blood and the pale scared faces of the frenchmen who
were again doing something by the post their trembling hands impeding
one another pierre breathing heavily looked around as if asking what
it meant the same question was expressed in all the looks that met his

on the faces of all the russians and of the french soldiers and officers
without exception he read the same dismay horror and conflict that
were in his own heart but who after all is doing this they are all
suffering as i am who then is it who flashed for an instant through
his mind

sharpshooters of the th forward shouted someone the fifth
prisoner the one next to pierre was led awayalone pierre did not
understand that he was saved that he and the rest had been brought
there only to witness the execution with evergrowing horror and no
sense of joy or relief he gazed at what was taking place the fifth man
was the factory lad in the loose cloak the moment they laid hands on
him he sprang aside in terror and clutched at pierre pierre shuddered
and shook himself free the lad was unable to walk they dragged him
along holding him up under the arms and he screamed when they got him
to the post he grew quiet as if he suddenly understood something
whether he understood that screaming was useless or whether he thought
it incredible that men should kill him at any rate he took his stand at
the post waiting to be blindfolded like the others and like a wounded
animal looked around him with glittering eyes

pierre was no longer able to turn away and close his eyes his curiosity
and agitation like that of the whole crowd reached the highest pitch
at this fifth murder like the others this fifth man seemed calm he
wrapped his loose cloak closer and rubbed one bare foot with the other

when they began to blindfold him he himself adjusted the knot which hurt
the back of his head then when they propped him against the
bloodstained post he leaned back and not being comfortable in that
position straightened himself adjusted his feet and leaned back again
more comfortably pierre did not take his eyes from him and did not miss
his slightest movement

probably a word of command was given and was followed by the reports of
eight muskets but try as he would pierre could not afterwards remember
having heard the slightest sound of the shots he only saw how the
workman suddenly sank down on the cords that held him how blood showed
itself in two places how the ropes slackened under the weight of the
hanging body and how the workman sat down his head hanging unnaturally
and one leg bent under him pierre ran up to the post no one hindered
him pale frightened people were doing something around the workman
the lower jaw of an old frenchman with a thick mustache trembled as he
untied the ropes the body collapsed the soldiers dragged it awkwardly
from the post and began pushing it into the pit

they all plainly and certainly knew that they were criminals who must
hide the traces of their guilt as quickly as possible

pierre glanced into the pit and saw that the factory lad was lying with
his knees close up to his head and one shoulder higher than the other
that shoulder rose and fell rhythmically and convulsively but spadefuls
of earth were already being thrown over the whole body one of the
soldiers evidently suffering shouted gruffly and angrily at pierre to
go back but pierre did not understand him and remained near the post
and no one drove him away

when the pit had been filled up a command was given pierre was taken
back to his place and the rows of troops on both sides of the post made
a half turn and went past it at a measured pace the twentyfour
sharpshooters with discharged muskets standing in the center of the
circle ran back to their places as the companies passed by

pierre gazed now with dazed eyes at these sharpshooters who ran in
couples out of the circle all but one rejoined their companies this
one a young soldier his face deadly pale his shako pushed back and
his musket resting on the ground still stood near the pit at the spot
from which he had fired he swayed like a drunken man taking some steps
forward and back to save himself from falling an old noncommissioned
officer ran out of the ranks and taking him by the elbow dragged him to
his company the crowd of russians and frenchmen began to disperse they
all went away silently and with drooping heads

that will teach them to start fires said one of the frenchmen

pierre glanced round at the speaker and saw that it was a soldier who
was trying to find some relief after what had been done but was not
able to do so without finishing what he had begun to say he made a
hopeless movement with his arm and went away





chapter xii

after the execution pierre was separated from the rest of the prisoners
and placed alone in a small ruined and befouled church

toward evening a noncommissioned officer entered with two soldiers and
told him that he had been pardoned and would now go to the barracks for
the prisoners of war without understanding what was said to him pierre
got up and went with the soldiers they took him to the upper end of the
field where there were some sheds built of charred planks beams and
battens and led him into one of them in the darkness some twenty
different men surrounded pierre he looked at them without understanding
who they were why they were there or what they wanted of him he heard
what they said but did not understand the meaning of the words and made
no kind of deduction from or application of them he replied to
questions they put to him but did not consider who was listening to his
replies nor how they would understand them he looked at their faces
and figures but they all seemed to him equally meaningless

from the moment pierre had witnessed those terrible murders committed by
men who did not wish to commit them it was as if the mainspring of his
life on which everything depended and which made everything appear
alive had suddenly been wrenched out and everything had collapsed into
a heap of meaningless rubbish though he did not acknowledge it to
himself his faith in the right ordering of the universe in humanity
in his own soul and in god had been destroyed he had experienced this
before but never so strongly as now when similar doubts had assailed
him before they had been the result of his own wrongdoing and at the
bottom of his heart he had felt that relief from his despair and from
those doubts was to be found within himself but now he felt that the
universe had crumbled before his eyes and only meaningless ruins
remained and this not by any fault of his own he felt that it was not
in his power to regain faith in the meaning of life

around him in the darkness men were standing and evidently something
about him interested them greatly they were telling him something and
asking him something then they led him away somewhere and at last he
found himself in a corner of the shed among men who were laughing and
talking on all sides

well then mates that very prince who some voice at the other
end of the shed was saying with a strong emphasis on the word who

sitting silent and motionless on a heap of straw against the wall
pierre sometimes opened and sometimes closed his eyes but as soon as he
closed them he saw before him the dreadful face of the factory
ladespecially dreadful because of its simplicityand the faces of the
murderers even more dreadful because of their disquiet and he opened
his eyes again and stared vacantly into the darkness around him

beside him in a stooping position sat a small man of whose presence he
was first made aware by a strong smell of perspiration which came from
him every time he moved this man was doing something to his legs in the
darkness and though pierre could not see his face he felt that the man
continually glanced at him on growing used to the darkness pierre saw
that the man was taking off his leg bands and the way he did it aroused
pierres interest

having unwound the string that tied the band on one leg he carefully
coiled it up and immediately set to work on the other leg glancing up
at pierre while one hand hung up the first string the other was already
unwinding the band on the second leg in this way having carefully
removed the leg bands by deft circular motions of his arm following one
another uninterruptedly the man hung the leg bands up on some pegs
fixed above his head then he took out a knife cut something closed
the knife placed it under the head of his bed and seating himself
comfortably clasped his arms round his lifted knees and fixed his eyes
on pierre the latter was conscious of something pleasant comforting
and wellrounded in these deft movements in the mans wellordered
arrangements in his corner and even in his very smell and he looked at
the man without taking his eyes from him

youve seen a lot of trouble sir eh the little man suddenly said

and there was so much kindliness and simplicity in his singsong voice
that pierre tried to reply but his jaw trembled and he felt tears
rising to his eyes the little fellow giving pierre no time to betray
his confusion instantly continued in the same pleasant tones

eh lad dont fret said he in the tender singsong caressing voice
old russian peasant women employ dont fret friendsuffer an hour
live for an age thats how it is my dear fellow and here we live
thank heaven without offense among these folk too there are good men
as well as bad said he and still speaking he turned on his knees
with a supple movement got up coughed and went off to another part of
the shed

eh you rascal pierre heard the same kind voice saying at the other
end of the shed so youve come you rascal she remembers now now
thatll do

and the soldier pushing away a little dog that was jumping up at him
returned to his place and sat down in his hands he had something
wrapped in a rag

here eat a bit sir said he resuming his former respectful tone as
he unwrapped and offered pierre some baked potatoes we had soup for
dinner and the potatoes are grand

pierre had not eaten all day and the smell of the potatoes seemed
extremely pleasant to him he thanked the soldier and began to eat

well are they all right said the soldier with a smile you should
do like this

he took a potato drew out his clasp knife cut the potato into two
equal halves on the palm of his hand sprinkled some salt on it from the
rag and handed it to pierre

the potatoes are grand he said once more eat some like that

pierre thought he had never eaten anything that tasted better

oh im all right said he but why did they shoot those poor
fellows the last one was hardly twenty

tss tt said the little man ah what a sin what a sin he
added quickly and as if his words were always waiting ready in his
mouth and flew out involuntarily he went on how was it sir that you
stayed in moscow

i didnt think they would come so soon i stayed accidentally replied
pierre

and how did they arrest you dear lad at your house

no i went to look at the fire and they arrested me there and tried
me as an incendiary

where theres law theres injustice put in the little man

and have you been here long pierre asked as he munched the last of
the potato

i it was last sunday they took me out of a hospital in moscow

why are you a soldier then

yes we are soldiers of the apsheron regiment i was dying of fever we
werent told anything there were some twenty of us lying there we had
no idea never guessed at all

and do you feel sad here pierre inquired

how can one help it lad my name is platon and the surname is
karataev he added evidently wishing to make it easier for pierre to
address him they call me little falcon in the regiment how is one
to help feeling sad moscowshes the mother of cities how can one see
all this and not feel sad but the maggot gnaws the cabbage yet dies
first thats what the old folks used to tell us he added rapidly

what what did you say asked pierre

who i said karataev i say things happen not as we plan but as god
judges he replied thinking that he was repeating what he had said
before and immediately continued

well and you have you a family estate sir and a house so you have
abundance then and a housewife and your old parents are they still
living he asked

and though it was too dark for pierre to see he felt that a suppressed
smile of kindliness puckered the soldiers lips as he put these
questions he seemed grieved that pierre had no parents especially that
he had no mother

a wife for counsel a motherinlaw for welcome but theres none as
dear as ones own mother said he well and have you little ones he
went on asking

again pierres negative answer seemed to distress him and he hastened
to add

never mind youre young folks yet and please god may still have some
the great thing is to live in harmony

but its all the same now pierre could not help saying

ah my dear fellow rejoined karataev never decline a prison or a
beggars sack

he seated himself more comfortably and coughed evidently preparing to
tell a long story

well my dear fellow i was still living at home he began we had a
welltodo homestead plenty of land we peasants lived well and our
house was one to thank god for when father and we went out mowing there
were seven of us we lived well we were real peasants it so
happened

and platon karataev told a long story of how he had gone into someones
copse to take wood how he had been caught by the keeper had been
tried flogged and sent to serve as a soldier

well lad and a smile changed the tone of his voice we thought it
was a misfortune but it turned out a blessing if it had not been for my
sin my brother would have had to go as a soldier but he my younger
brother had five little ones while i you see only left a wife
behind we had a little girl but god took her before i went as a
soldier i come home on leave and ill tell you how it was i look and
see that they are living better than before the yard full of cattle
the women at home two brothers away earning wages and only michael the
youngest at home father he says all my children are the same to me
it hurts the same whichever finger gets bitten but if platon hadnt
been shaved for a soldier michael would have had to go called us all
to him and will you believe it placed us in front of the icons
michael he says come here and bow down to his feet and you young
woman you bow down too and you grandchildren also bow down before
him do you understand he says thats how it is dear fellow fate
looks for a head but we are always judging thats not wellthats not
right our luck is like water in a dragnet you pull at it and it
bulges but when youve drawn it out its empty thats how it is

and platon shifted his seat on the straw

after a short silence he rose

well i think you must be sleepy said he and began rapidly crossing
himself and repeating

lord jesus christ holy saint nicholas frola and lavra lord jesus
christ holy saint nicholas frola and lavra lord jesus christ have
mercy on us and save us he concluded then bowed to the ground got
up sighed and sat down again on his heap of straw thats the way
lay me down like a stone o god and raise me up like a loaf he
muttered as he lay down pulling his coat over him

what prayer was that you were saying asked pierre

eh murmured platon who had almost fallen asleep what was i saying
i was praying dont you pray

yes i do said pierre but what was that you said frola and lavra

well of course replied platon quickly the horses saints one must
pity the animals too eh the rascal now youve curled up and got warm
you daughter of a bitch said karataev touching the dog that lay at
his feet and again turning over he fell asleep immediately

sounds of crying and screaming came from somewhere in the distance
outside and flames were visible through the cracks of the shed but
inside it was quiet and dark for a long time pierre did not sleep but
lay with eyes open in the darkness listening to the regular snoring of
platon who lay beside him and he felt that the world that had been
shattered was once more stirring in his soul with a new beauty and on
new and unshakable foundations





chapter xiii

twentythree soldiers three officers and two officials were confined
in the shed in which pierre had been placed and where he remained for
four weeks

when pierre remembered them afterwards they all seemed misty figures to
him except platon karataev who always remained in his mind a most vivid
and precious memory and the personification of everything russian
kindly and round when pierre saw his neighbor next morning at dawn the
first impression of him as of something round was fully confirmed
platons whole figurein a french overcoat girdled with a cord a
soldiers cap and bast shoeswas round his head was quite round his
back chest shoulders and even his arms which he held as if ever
ready to embrace something were rounded his pleasant smile and his
large gentle brown eyes were also round

platon karataev must have been fifty judging by his stories of
campaigns he had been in told as by an old soldier he did not himself
know his age and was quite unable to determine it but his brilliantly
white strong teeth which showed in two unbroken semicircles when he
laughedas he often didwere all sound and good there was not a gray
hair in his beard or on his head and his whole body gave an impression
of suppleness and especially of firmness and endurance

his face despite its fine rounded wrinkles had an expression of
innocence and youth his voice was pleasant and musical but the chief
peculiarity of his speech was its directness and appositeness it was
evident that he never considered what he had said or was going to say
and consequently the rapidity and justice of his intonation had an
irresistible persuasiveness

his physical strength and agility during the first days of his
imprisonment were such that he seemed not to know what fatigue and
sickness meant every night before lying down he said lord lay me
down as a stone and raise me up as a loaf and every morning on getting
up he said i lay down and curled up i get up and shake myself and
indeed he only had to lie down to fall asleep like a stone and he only
had to shake himself to be ready without a moments delay for some
work just as children are ready to play directly they awake he could
do everything not very well but not badly he baked cooked sewed
planed and mended boots he was always busy and only at night allowed
himself conversationof which he was fondand songs he did not sing
like a trained singer who knows he is listened to but like the birds
evidently giving vent to the sounds in the same way that one stretches
oneself or walks about to get rid of stiffness and the sounds were
always highpitched mournful delicate and almost feminine and his
face at such times was very serious

having been taken prisoner and allowed his beard to grow he seemed to
have thrown off all that had been forced upon himeverything military
and alien to himselfand had returned to his former peasant habits

a soldier on leavea shirt outside breeches he would say

he did not like talking about his life as a soldier though he did not
complain and often mentioned that he had not been flogged once during
the whole of his army service when he related anything it was generally
some old and evidently precious memory of his christian life as he
called his peasant existence the proverbs of which his talk was full
were for the most part not the coarse and indecent saws soldiers employ
but those folk sayings which taken without a context seem so
insignificant but when used appositely suddenly acquire a significance
of profound wisdom

he would often say the exact opposite of what he had said on a previous
occasion yet both would be right he liked to talk and he talked well
adorning his speech with terms of endearment and with folk sayings which
pierre thought he invented himself but the chief charm of his talk lay
in the fact that the commonest eventssometimes just such as pierre had
witnessed without taking notice of themassumed in karataevs a
character of solemn fitness he liked to hear the folk tales one of the
soldiers used to tell of an evening they were always the same but
most of all he liked to hear stories of real life he would smile
joyfully when listening to such stories now and then putting in a word
or asking a question to make the moral beauty of what he was told clear
to himself karataev had no attachments friendships or love as pierre
understood them but loved and lived affectionately with everything life
brought him in contact with particularly with mannot any particular
man but those with whom he happened to be he loved his dog his
comrades the french and pierre who was his neighbor but pierre felt
that in spite of karataevs affectionate tenderness for him by which he
unconsciously gave pierres spiritual life its due he would not have
grieved for a moment at parting from him and pierre began to feel in
the same way toward karataev

to all the other prisoners platon karataev seemed a most ordinary
soldier they called him little falcon or platosha chaffed him
goodnaturedly and sent him on errands but to pierre he always
remained what he had seemed that first night an unfathomable rounded
eternal personification of the spirit of simplicity and truth

platon karataev knew nothing by heart except his prayers when he began
to speak he seemed not to know how he would conclude

sometimes pierre struck by the meaning of his words would ask him to
repeat them but platon could never recall what he had said a moment
before just as he never could repeat to pierre the words of his
favorite song native and birch tree and my heart is sick occurred in
it but when spoken and not sung no meaning could be got out of it he
did not and could not understand the meaning of words apart from their
context every word and action of his was the manifestation of an
activity unknown to him which was his life but his life as he
regarded it had no meaning as a separate thing it had meaning only as
part of a whole of which he was always conscious his words and actions
flowed from him as evenly inevitably and spontaneously as fragrance
exhales from a flower he could not understand the value or significance
of any word or deed taken separately





chapter xiv

when princess mary heard from nicholas that her brother was with the
rostóvs at yaroslavl she at once prepared to go there in spite of her
aunts efforts to dissuade herand not merely to go herself but to take
her nephew with her whether it were difficult or easy possible or
impossible she did not ask and did not want to know it was her duty
not only to herself to be near her brother who was perhaps dying but
to do everything possible to take his son to him and so she prepared to
set off that she had not heard from prince andrew himself princess
mary attributed to his being too weak to write or to his considering the
long journey too hard and too dangerous for her and his son

in a few days princess mary was ready to start her equipages were the
huge family coach in which she had traveled to voronezh a semiopen
trap and a baggage cart with her traveled mademoiselle bourienne
little nicholas and his tutor her old nurse three maids tíkhon and a
young footman and courier her aunt had sent to accompany her

the usual route through moscow could not be thought of and the
roundabout way princess mary was obliged to take through lipetsk
ryazan vladimir and shuya was very long and as post horses were not
everywhere obtainable very difficult and near ryazan where the french
were said to have shown themselves was even dangerous

during this difficult journey mademoiselle bourienne dessalles and
princess marys servants were astonished at her energy and firmness of
spirit she went to bed later and rose earlier than any of them and no
difficulties daunted her thanks to her activity and energy which
infected her fellow travelers they approached yaroslavl by the end of
the second week

the last days of her stay in voronezh had been the happiest of her life
her love for rostóv no longer tormented or agitated her it filled her
whole soul had become an integral part of herself and she no longer
struggled against it latterly she had become convinced that she loved
and was beloved though she never said this definitely to herself in
words she had become convinced of it at her last interview with
nicholas when he had come to tell her that her brother was with the
rostóvs not by a single word had nicholas alluded to the fact that
prince andrews relations with natásha might if he recovered be
renewed but princess mary saw by his face that he knew and thought of
this

yet in spite of that his relation to herconsiderate delicate and
lovingnot only remained unchanged but it sometimes seemed to princess
mary that he was even glad that the family connection between them
allowed him to express his friendship more freely she knew that she
loved for the first and only time in her life and felt that she was
beloved and was happy in regard to it

but this happiness on one side of her spiritual nature did not prevent
her feeling grief for her brother with full force on the contrary that
spiritual tranquility on the one side made it the more possible for her
to give full play to her feeling for her brother that feeling was so
strong at the moment of leaving voronezh that those who saw her off as
they looked at her careworn despairing face felt sure she would fall
ill on the journey but the very difficulties and preoccupations of the
journey which she took so actively in hand saved her for a while from
her grief and gave her strength

as always happens when traveling princess mary thought only of the
journey itself forgetting its object but as she approached yaroslavl
the thought of what might await her therenot after many days but that
very eveningagain presented itself to her and her agitation increased
to its utmost limit

the courier who had been sent on in advance to find out where the
rostóvs were staying in yaroslavl and in what condition prince andrew
was when he met the big coach just entering the town gates was appalled
by the terrible pallor of the princess face that looked out at him from
the window

i have found out everything your excellency the rostóvs are staying
at the merchant bronnikovs house in the square not far from here
right above the volga said the courier

princess mary looked at him with frightened inquiry not understanding
why he did not reply to what she chiefly wanted to know how was her
brother mademoiselle bourienne put that question for her

how is the prince she asked

his excellency is staying in the same house with them

then he is alive thought princess mary and asked in a low voice
how is he

the servants say he is still the same

what still the same might mean princess mary did not ask but with an
unnoticed glance at little sevenyearold nicholas who was sitting in
front of her looking with pleasure at the town she bowed her head and
did not raise it again till the heavy coach rumbling shaking and
swaying came to a stop the carriage steps clattered as they were let
down

the carriage door was opened on the left there was watera great
riverand on the right a porch there were people at the entrance
servants and a rosy girl with a large plait of black hair smiling as
it seemed to princess mary in an unpleasantly affected way this was
sónya princess mary ran up the steps this way this way said the
girl with the same artificial smile and the princess found herself in
the hall facing an elderly woman of oriental type who came rapidly to
meet her with a look of emotion this was the countess she embraced
princess mary and kissed her

mon enfant she muttered je vous aime et vous connais depuis
longtemps

 my child i love you and have known you a long time

despite her excitement princess mary realized that this was the
countess and that it was necessary to say something to her hardly
knowing how she did it she contrived to utter a few polite phrases in
french in the same tone as those that had been addressed to her and
asked how is he

the doctor says that he is not in danger said the countess but as
she spoke she raised her eyes with a sigh and her gesture conveyed a
contradiction of her words

where is he can i see himcan i asked the princess

one moment princess one moment my dear is this his son said the
countess turning to little nicholas who was coming in with dessalles
there will be room for everybody this is a big house oh what a
lovely boy

the countess took princess mary into the drawing room where sónya was
talking to mademoiselle bourienne the countess caressed the boy and
the old count came in and welcomed the princess he had changed very
much since princess mary had last seen him then he had been a brisk
cheerful selfassured old man now he seemed a pitiful bewildered
person while talking to princess mary he continually looked round as if
asking everyone whether he was doing the right thing after the
destruction of moscow and of his property thrown out of his accustomed
groove he seemed to have lost the sense of his own significance and to
feel that there was no longer a place for him in life

in spite of her one desire to see her brother as soon as possible and
her vexation that at the moment when all she wanted was to see him they
should be trying to entertain her and pretending to admire her nephew
the princess noticed all that was going on around her and felt the
necessity of submitting for a time to this new order of things which
she had entered she knew it to be necessary and though it was hard for
her she was not vexed with these people

this is my niece said the count introducing sónyayou dont know
her princess

princess mary turned to sónya and trying to stifle the hostile feeling
that arose in her toward the girl she kissed her but she felt
oppressed by the fact that the mood of everyone around her was so far
from what was in her own heart

where is he she asked again addressing them all

he is downstairs natásha is with him answered sónya flushing we
have sent to ask i think you must be tired princess

tears of vexation showed themselves in princess marys eyes she turned
away and was about to ask the countess again how to go to him when
light impetuous and seemingly buoyant steps were heard at the door
the princess looked round and saw natásha coming in almost runningthat
natásha whom she had liked so little at their meeting in moscow long
since

but hardly had the princess looked at natáshas face before she realized
that here was a real comrade in her grief and consequently a friend
she ran to meet her embraced her and began to cry on her shoulder

as soon as natásha sitting at the head of prince andrews bed heard of
princess marys arrival she softly left his room and hastened to her
with those swift steps that had sounded buoyant to princess mary

there was only one expression on her agitated face when she ran into the
drawing roomthat of loveboundless love for him for her and for all
that was near to the man she loved and of pity suffering for others
and passionate desire to give herself entirely to helping them it was
plain that at that moment there was in natáshas heart no thought of
herself or of her own relations with prince andrew

princess mary with her acute sensibility understood all this at the
first glance at natáshas face and wept on her shoulder with sorrowful
pleasure

come come to him mary said natásha leading her into the other
room

princess mary raised her head dried her eyes and turned to natásha
she felt that from her she would be able to understand and learn
everything

how she began her question but stopped short

she felt that it was impossible to ask or to answer in words
natáshas face and eyes would have to tell her all more clearly and
profoundly

natásha was gazing at her but seemed afraid and in doubt whether to say
all she knew or not she seemed to feel that before those luminous eyes
which penetrated into the very depths of her heart it was impossible
not to tell the whole truth which she saw and suddenly natáshas lips
twitched ugly wrinkles gathered round her mouth and covering her face
with her hands she burst into sobs

princess mary understood

but she still hoped and asked in words she herself did not trust

but how is his wound what is his general condition

you you will see was all natásha could say

they sat a little while downstairs near his room till they had left off
crying and were able to go to him with calm faces

how has his whole illness gone is it long since he grew worse when
did this happen princess mary inquired

natásha told her that at first there had been danger from his feverish
condition and the pain he suffered but at troitsa that had passed and
the doctor had only been afraid of gangrene that danger had also
passed when they reached yaroslavl the wound had begun to fester
natásha knew all about such things as festering and the doctor had
said that the festering might take a normal course then fever set in
but the doctor had said the fever was not very serious

but two days ago this suddenly happened said natásha struggling with
her sobs i dont know why but you will see what he is like

is he weaker thinner asked the princess

no its not that but worse you will see o mary he is too good he
cannot cannot live because





chapter xv

when natásha opened prince andrews door with a familiar movement and
let princess mary pass into the room before her the princess felt the
sobs in her throat hard as she had tried to prepare herself and now
tried to remain tranquil she knew that she would be unable to look at
him without tears

the princess understood what natásha had meant by the words two days
ago this suddenly happened she understood those words to mean that he
had suddenly softened and that this softening and gentleness were signs
of approaching death as she stepped to the door she already saw in
imagination andrews face as she remembered it in childhood a gentle
mild sympathetic face which he had rarely shown and which therefore
affected her very strongly she was sure he would speak soft tender
words to her such as her father had uttered before his death and that
she would not be able to bear it and would burst into sobs in his
presence yet sooner or later it had to be and she went in the sobs
rose higher and higher in her throat as she more and more clearly
distinguished his form and her shortsighted eyes tried to make out his
features and then she saw his face and met his gaze

he was lying in a squirrelfur dressing gown on a divan surrounded by
pillows he was thin and pale in one thin translucently white hand he
held a handkerchief while with the other he stroked the delicate
mustache he had grown moving his fingers slowly his eyes gazed at them
as they entered

on seeing his face and meeting his eyes princess marys pace suddenly
slackened she felt her tears dry up and her sobs ceased she suddenly
felt guilty and grew timid on catching the expression of his face and
eyes

but in what am i to blame she asked herself and his cold stern look
replied because you are alive and thinking of the living while i

in the deep gaze that seemed to look not outwards but inwards there was
an almost hostile expression as he slowly regarded his sister and
natásha

he kissed his sister holding her hand in his as was their wont

how are you mary how did you manage to get here said he in a voice
as calm and aloof as his look

had he screamed in agony that scream would not have struck such horror
into princess marys heart as the tone of his voice

and have you brought little nicholas he asked in the same slow quiet
manner and with an obvious effort to remember

how are you now said princess mary herself surprised at what she was
saying

that my dear you must ask the doctor he replied and again making
an evident effort to be affectionate he said with his lips only his
words clearly did not correspond to his thoughts

merci chere amie detre venue

 thank you for coming my dear

princess mary pressed his hand the pressure made him wince just
perceptibly he was silent and she did not know what to say she now
understood what had happened to him two days before in his words his
tone and especially in that calm almost antagonistic look could be
felt an estrangement from everything belonging to this world terrible
in one who is alive evidently only with an effort did he understand
anything living but it was obvious that he failed to understand not
because he lacked the power to do so but because he understood something
elsesomething the living did not and could not understandand which
wholly occupied his mind

there you see how strangely fate has brought us together said he
breaking the silence and pointing to natásha she looks after me all
the time

princess mary heard him and did not understand how he could say such a
thing he the sensitive tender prince andrew how could he say that
before her whom he loved and who loved him had he expected to live he
could not have said those words in that offensively cold tone if he had
not known that he was dying how could he have failed to pity her and
how could he speak like that in her presence the only explanation was
that he was indifferent because something else much more important
had been revealed to him

the conversation was cold and disconnected and continually broke off

mary came by way of ryazan said natásha

prince andrew did not notice that she called his sister mary and only
after calling her so in his presence did natásha notice it herself

really he asked

they told her that all moscow has been burned down and that

natásha stopped it was impossible to talk it was plain that he was
making an effort to listen but could not do so

yes they say its burned he said its a great pity and he gazed
straight before him absently stroking his mustache with his fingers

and so you have met count nicholas mary prince andrew suddenly said
evidently wishing to speak pleasantly to them he wrote here that he
took a great liking to you he went on simply and calmly evidently
unable to understand all the complex significance his words had for
living people if you liked him too it would be a good thing for you
to get married he added rather more quickly as if pleased at having
found words he had long been seeking

princess mary heard his words but they had no meaning for her except as
a proof of how far away he now was from everything living

why talk of me she said quietly and glanced at natásha

natásha who felt her glance did not look at her all three were again
silent

andrew would you like princess mary suddenly said in a trembling
voice would you like to see little nicholas he is always talking
about you

prince andrew smiled just perceptibly and for the first time but
princess mary who knew his face so well saw with horror that he did
not smile with pleasure or affection for his son but with quiet gentle
irony because he thought she was trying what she believed to be the last
means of arousing him

yes i shall be very glad to see him is he quite well

when little nicholas was brought into prince andrews room he looked at
his father with frightened eyes but did not cry because no one else
was crying prince andrew kissed him and evidently did not know what to
say to him

when nicholas had been led away princess mary again went up to her
brother kissed him and unable to restrain her tears any longer began
to cry

he looked at her attentively

is it about nicholas he asked

princess mary nodded her head weeping

mary you know the gosp but he broke off

what did you say

nothing you mustnt cry here he said looking at her with the same
cold expression

when princess mary began to cry he understood that she was crying at
the thought that little nicholas would be left without a father with a
great effort he tried to return to life and to see things from their
point of view

yes to them it must seem sad he thought but how simple it is

the fowls of the air sow not neither do they reap yet your father
feedeth them he said to himself and wished to say to princess mary
but no they will take it their own way they wont understand they
cant understand that all those feelings they prize soall our feelings
all those ideas that seem so important to us are unnecessary we cannot
understand one another and he remained silent

prince andrews little son was seven he could scarcely read and knew
nothing after that day he lived through many things gaining knowledge
observation and experience but had he possessed all the faculties he
afterwards acquired he could not have had a better or more profound
understanding of the meaning of the scene he had witnessed between his
father mary and natásha than he had then he understood it
completely and leaving the room without crying went silently up to
natásha who had come out with him and looked shyly at her with his
beautiful thoughtful eyes then his uplifted rosy upper lip trembled
and leaning his head against her he began to cry

after that he avoided dessalles and the countess who caressed him and
either sat alone or came timidly to princess mary or to natásha of whom
he seemed even fonder than of his aunt and clung to them quietly and
shyly

when princess mary had left prince andrew she fully understood what
natáshas face had told her she did not speak any more to natásha of
hopes of saving his life she took turns with her beside his sofa and
did not cry any more but prayed continually turning in soul to that
eternal and unfathomable whose presence above the dying man was now so
evident





chapter xvi

not only did prince andrew know he would die but he felt that he was
dying and was already half dead he was conscious of an aloofness from
everything earthly and a strange and joyous lightness of existence
without haste or agitation he awaited what was coming that inexorable
eternal distant and unknown the presence of which he had felt
continually all his lifewas now near to him and by the strange
lightness he experienced almost comprehensible and palpable

formerly he had feared the end he had twice experienced that terribly
tormenting fear of deaththe endbut now he no longer understood that
fear

he had felt it for the first time when the shell spun like a top before
him and he looked at the fallow field the bushes and the sky and
knew that he was face to face with death when he came to himself after
being wounded and the flower of eternal unfettered love had instantly
unfolded itself in his soul as if freed from the bondage of life that
had restrained it he no longer feared death and ceased to think about
it

during the hours of solitude suffering and partial delirium he spent
after he was wounded the more deeply he penetrated into the new
principle of eternal love revealed to him the more he unconsciously
detached himself from earthly life to love everything and everybody and
always to sacrifice oneself for love meant not to love anyone not to
live this earthly life and the more imbued he became with that
principle of love the more he renounced life and the more completely he
destroyed that dreadful barrier whichin the absence of such lovestands
between life and death when during those first days he remembered that
he would have to die he said to himself well what of it so much the
better

but after the night in mytishchi when half delirious he had seen her
for whom he longed appear before him and having pressed her hand to his
lips had shed gentle happy tears love for a particular woman again
crept unobserved into his heart and once more bound him to life and
joyful and agitating thoughts began to occupy his mind recalling the
moment at the ambulance station when he had seen kurágin he could not
now regain the feeling he then had but was tormented by the question
whether kurágin was alive and he dared not inquire

his illness pursued its normal physical course but what natásha
referred to when she said this suddenly happened had occurred two
days before princess mary arrived it was the last spiritual struggle
between life and death in which death gained the victory it was the
unexpected realization of the fact that he still valued life as
presented to him in the form of his love for natásha and a last though
ultimately vanquished attack of terror before the unknown

it was evening as usual after dinner he was slightly feverish and his
thoughts were preternaturally clear sónya was sitting by the table he
began to doze suddenly a feeling of happiness seized him

ah she has come thought he

and so it was in sónyas place sat natásha who had just come in
noiselessly

since she had begun looking after him he had always experienced this
physical consciousness of her nearness she was sitting in an armchair
placed sideways screening the light of the candle from him and was
knitting a stocking she had learned to knit stockings since prince
andrew had casually mentioned that no one nursed the sick so well as old
nurses who knit stockings and that there is something soothing in the
knitting of stockings the needles clicked lightly in her slender
rapidly moving hands and he could clearly see the thoughtful profile of
her drooping face she moved and the ball rolled off her knees she
started glanced round at him and screening the candle with her hand
stooped carefully with a supple and exact movement picked up the ball
and regained her former position

he looked at her without moving and saw that she wanted to draw a deep
breath after stooping but refrained from doing so and breathed
cautiously

at the troitsa monastery they had spoken of the past and he had told
her that if he lived he would always thank god for his wound which had
brought them together again but after that they never spoke of the
future

can it or can it not be he now thought as he looked at her and
listened to the light click of the steel needles can fate have brought
me to her so strangely only for me to die is it possible that the
truth of life has been revealed to me only to show me that i have spent
my life in falsity i love her more than anything in the world but what
am i to do if i love her he thought and he involuntarily groaned
from a habit acquired during his sufferings

on hearing that sound natásha put down the stocking leaned nearer to
him and suddenly noticing his shining eyes stepped lightly up to him
and bent over him

you are not asleep

no i have been looking at you a long time i felt you come in no one
else gives me that sense of soft tranquillity that you do that light
i want to weep for joy

natásha drew closer to him her face shone with rapturous joy

natásha i love you too much more than anything in the world

and ishe turned away for an instant why too much she asked

why too much well what do you what do you feel in your soul your
whole soulshall i live what do you think

i am sure of it sure natásha almost shouted taking hold of both his
hands with a passionate movement

he remained silent awhile

how good it would be and taking her hand he kissed it

natásha felt happy and agitated but at once remembered that this would
not do and that he had to be quiet

but you have not slept she said repressing her joy try to sleep
please

he pressed her hand and released it and she went back to the candle and
sat down again in her former position twice she turned and looked at
him and her eyes met his beaming at her she set herself a task on her
stocking and resolved not to turn round till it was finished

soon he really shut his eyes and fell asleep he did not sleep long and
suddenly awoke with a start and in a cold perspiration

as he fell asleep he had still been thinking of the subject that now
always occupied his mindabout life and death and chiefly about death
he felt himself nearer to it

love what is love he thought

love hinders death love is life all everything that i understand i
understand only because i love everything is everything exists only
because i love everything is united by it alone love is god and to
die means that i a particle of love shall return to the general and
eternal source these thoughts seemed to him comforting but they were
only thoughts something was lacking in them they were not clear they
were too onesidedly personal and brainspun and there was the former
agitation and obscurity he fell asleep

he dreamed that he was lying in the room he really was in but that he
was quite well and unwounded many various indifferent and
insignificant people appeared before him he talked to them and
discussed something trivial they were preparing to go away somewhere
prince andrew dimly realized that all this was trivial and that he had
more important cares but he continued to speak surprising them by
empty witticisms gradually unnoticed all these persons began to
disappear and a single question that of the closed door superseded all
else he rose and went to the door to bolt and lock it everything
depended on whether he was or was not in time to lock it he went and
tried to hurry but his legs refused to move and he knew he would not be
in time to lock the door though he painfully strained all his powers he
was seized by an agonizing fear and that fear was the fear of death it
stood behind the door but just when he was clumsily creeping toward the
door that dreadful something on the other side was already pressing
against it and forcing its way in something not humandeathwas
breaking in through that door and had to be kept out he seized the
door making a final effort to hold it backto lock it was no longer
possiblebut his efforts were weak and clumsy and the door pushed from
behind by that terror opened and closed again

once again it pushed from outside his last superhuman efforts were vain
and both halves of the door noiselessly opened it entered and it was
death and prince andrew died

but at the instant he died prince andrew remembered that he was asleep
and at the very instant he died having made an effort he awoke

yes it was death i diedand woke up yes death is an awakening and
all at once it grew light in his soul and the veil that had till then
concealed the unknown was lifted from his spiritual vision he felt as
if powers till then confined within him had been liberated and that
strange lightness did not again leave him

when waking in a cold perspiration he moved on the divan natásha went
up and asked him what was the matter he did not answer and looked at
her strangely not understanding

that was what had happened to him two days before princess marys
arrival from that day as the doctor expressed it the wasting fever
assumed a malignant character but what the doctor said did not interest
natásha she saw the terrible moral symptoms which to her were more
convincing

from that day an awakening from life came to prince andrew together with
his awakening from sleep and compared to the duration of life it did
not seem to him slower than an awakening from sleep compared to the
duration of a dream

there was nothing terrible or violent in this comparatively slow
awakening

his last days and hours passed in an ordinary and simple way both
princess mary and natásha who did not leave him felt this they did
not weep or shudder and during these last days they themselves felt that
they were not attending on him he was no longer there he had left
them but on what reminded them most closely of himhis body both felt
this so strongly that the outward and terrible side of death did not
affect them and they did not feel it necessary to foment their grief
neither in his presence nor out of it did they weep nor did they ever
talk to one another about him they felt that they could not express in
words what they understood

they both saw that he was sinking slowly and quietly deeper and deeper
away from them and they both knew that this had to be so and that it
was right

he confessed and received communion everyone came to take leave of
him when they brought his son to him he pressed his lips to the boys
and turned away not because he felt it hard and sad princess mary and
natásha understood that but simply because he thought it was all that
was required of him but when they told him to bless the boy he did
what was demanded and looked round as if asking whether there was
anything else he should do

when the last convulsions of the body which the spirit was leaving
occurred princess mary and natásha were present

is it over said princess mary when his body had for a few minutes
lain motionless growing cold before them natásha went up looked at
the dead eyes and hastened to close them she closed them but did not
kiss them but clung to that which reminded her most nearly of himhis
body

where has he gone where is he now

when the body washed and dressed lay in the coffin on a table
everyone came to take leave of him and they all wept

little nicholas cried because his heart was rent by painful perplexity
the countess and sónya cried from pity for natásha and because he was no
more the old count cried because he felt that before long he too
must take the same terrible step

natásha and princess mary also wept now but not because of their own
personal grief they wept with a reverent and softening emotion which
had taken possession of their souls at the consciousness of the simple
and solemn mystery of death that had been accomplished in their
presence





book thirteen





chapter i

mans mind cannot grasp the causes of events in their completeness but
the desire to find those causes is implanted in mans soul and without
considering the multiplicity and complexity of the conditions any one of
which taken separately may seem to be the cause he snatches at the
first approximation to a cause that seems to him intelligible and says
this is the cause in historical events where the actions of men are
the subject of observation the first and most primitive approximation
to present itself was the will of the gods and after that the will of
those who stood in the most prominent positionthe heroes of history
but we need only penetrate to the essence of any historic eventwhich
lies in the activity of the general mass of men who take part in itto
be convinced that the will of the historic hero does not control the
actions of the mass but is itself continually controlled it may seem to
be a matter of indifference whether we understand the meaning of
historical events this way or that yet there is the same difference
between a man who says that the people of the west moved on the east
because napoleon wished it and a man who says that this happened because
it had to happen as there is between those who declared that the earth
was stationary and that the planets moved round it and those who
admitted that they did not know what upheld the earth but knew there
were laws directing its movement and that of the other planets there
is and can be no cause of an historical event except the one cause of
all causes but there are laws directing events and some of these laws
are known to us while we are conscious of others we cannot comprehend
the discovery of these laws is only possible when we have quite
abandoned the attempt to find the cause in the will of some one man
just as the discovery of the laws of the motion of the planets was
possible only when men abandoned the conception of the fixity of the
earth

the historians consider that next to the battle of borodino and the
occupation of moscow by the enemy and its destruction by fire the most
important episode of the war of  was the movement of the russian
army from the ryazana to the kaluga road and to the tarutino campthe
socalled flank march across the krasnaya pakhra river they ascribe the
glory of that achievement of genius to different men and dispute as to
whom the honor is due even foreign historians including the french
acknowledge the genius of the russian commanders when they speak of that
flank march but it is hard to understand why military writers and
following them others consider this flank march to be the profound
conception of some one man who saved russia and destroyed napoleon in
the first place it is hard to understand where the profundity and genius
of this movement lay for not much mental effort was needed to see that
the best position for an army when it is not being attacked is where
there are most provisions and even a dull boy of thirteen could have
guessed that the best position for an army after its retreat from moscow
in  was on the kaluga road so it is impossible to understand by
what reasoning the historians reach the conclusion that this maneuver
was a profound one and it is even more difficult to understand just why
they think that this maneuver was calculated to save russia and destroy
the french for this flank march had it been preceded accompanied or
followed by other circumstances might have proved ruinous to the
russians and salutary for the french if the position of the russian
army really began to improve from the time of that march it does not at
all follow that the march was the cause of it

that flank march might not only have failed to give any advantage to the
russian army but might in other circumstances have led to its
destruction what would have happened had moscow not burned down if
murat had not lost sight of the russians if napoleon had not remained
inactive if the russian army at krasnaya pakhra had given battle as
bennigsen and barclay advised what would have happened had the french
attacked the russians while they were marching beyond the pakhra what
would have happened if on approaching tarutino napoleon had attacked
the russians with but a tenth of the energy he had shown when he
attacked them at smolensk what would have happened had the french moved
on petersburg in any of these eventualities the flank march that
brought salvation might have proved disastrous

the third and most incomprehensible thing is that people studying
history deliberately avoid seeing that this flank march cannot be
attributed to any one man that no one ever foresaw it and that in
reality like the retreat from fili it did not suggest itself to anyone
in its entirety but resultedmoment by moment step by step event by
eventfrom an endless number of most diverse circumstances and was only
seen in its entirety when it had been accomplished and belonged to the
past

at the council at fili the prevailing thought in the minds of the
russian commanders was the one naturally suggesting itself namely a
direct retreat by the nizhni road in proof of this there is the fact
that the majority of the council voted for such a retreat and above all
there is the wellknown conversation after the council between the
commander in chief and lanskoy who was in charge of the commissariat
department lanskoy informed the commanderinchief that the army
supplies were for the most part stored along the oka in the tula and
ryazan provinces and that if they retreated on nizhni the army would be
separated from its supplies by the broad river oka which cannot be
crossed early in winter this was the first indication of the necessity
of deviating from what had previously seemed the most natural coursea
direct retreat on nizhninovgorod the army turned more to the south
along the ryazan road and nearer to its supplies subsequently the
inactivity of the french who even lost sight of the russian army
concern for the safety of the arsenal at tula and especially the
advantages of drawing nearer to its supplies caused the army to turn
still further south to the tula road having crossed over by a forced
march to the tula road beyond the pakhra the russian commanders
intended to remain at podolsk and had no thought of the tarutino
position but innumerable circumstances and the reappearance of french
troops who had for a time lost touch with the russians and projects of
giving battle and above all the abundance of provisions in kaluga
province obliged our army to turn still more to the south and to cross
from the tula to the kaluga road and go to tarutino which was between
the roads along which those supplies lay just as it is impossible to
say when it was decided to abandon moscow so it is impossible to say
precisely when or by whom it was decided to move to tarutino only
when the army had got there as the result of innumerable and varying
forces did people begin to assure themselves that they had desired this
movement and long ago foreseen its result





chapter ii

the famous flank movement merely consisted in this after the advance of
the french had ceased the russian army which had been continually
retreating straight back from the invaders deviated from that direct
course and not finding itself pursued was naturally drawn toward the
district where supplies were abundant

if instead of imagining to ourselves commanders of genius leading the
russian army we picture that army without any leaders it could not
have done anything but make a return movement toward moscow describing
an arc in the direction where most provisions were to be found and where
the country was richest

that movement from the nizhni to the ryazan tula and kaluga roads was
so natural that even the russian marauders moved in that direction and
demands were sent from petersburg for kutúzov to take his army that way
at tarutino kutúzov received what was almost a reprimand from the
emperor for having moved his army along the ryazan road and the
emperors letter indicated to him the very position he had already
occupied near kaluga

having rolled like a ball in the direction of the impetus given by the
whole campaign and by the battle of borodino the russian armywhen the
strength of that impetus was exhausted and no fresh push was
receivedassumed the position natural to it

kutúzovs merit lay not in any strategic maneuver of genius as it is
called but in the fact that he alone understood the significance of
what had happened he alone then understood the meaning of the french
armys inactivity he alone continued to assert that the battle of
borodino had been a victory he alonewho as commanderinchief might
have been expected to be eager to attackemployed his whole strength to
restrain the russian army from useless engagements

the beast wounded at borodino was lying where the fleeing hunter had
left him but whether he was still alive whether he was strong and
merely lying low the hunter did not know suddenly the beast was heard
to moan

the moan of that wounded beast the french army which betrayed its
calamitous condition was the sending of lauriston to kutúzovs camp with
overtures for peace

napoleon with his usual assurance that whatever entered his head was
right wrote to kutúzov the first words that occurred to him though
they were meaningless

monsieur le prince koutouzov i am sending one of my adjutantsgeneral
to discuss several interesting questions with you i beg your highness
to credit what he says to you especially when he expresses the
sentiment of esteem and special regard i have long entertained for your
person this letter having no other object i pray god monsieur le
prince koutouzov to keep you in his holy and gracious protection

napoleon moscow october

kutúzov replied i should be cursed by posterity were i looked on as
the initiator of a settlement of any sort such is the present spirit of
my nation but he continued to exert all his powers to restrain his
troops from attacking

during the month that the french troops were pillaging in moscow and the
russian troops were quietly encamped at tarutino a change had taken
place in the relative strength of the two armiesboth in spirit and in
numberas a result of which the superiority had passed to the russian
side though the condition and numbers of the french army were unknown
to the russians as soon as that change occurred the need of attacking
at once showed itself by countless signs these signs were lauristons
mission the abundance of provisions at tarutino the reports coming in
from all sides of the inactivity and disorder of the french the flow of
recruits to our regiments the fine weather the long rest the russian
soldiers had enjoyed and the impatience to do what they had been
assembled for which usually shows itself in an army that has been
resting curiosity as to what the french army so long lost sight of
was doing the boldness with which our outposts now scouted close up to
the french stationed at tarutino the news of easy successes gained by
peasants and guerrilla troops over the french the envy aroused by this
the desire for revenge that lay in the heart of every russian as long as
the french were in moscow and above all a dim consciousness in every
soldiers mind that the relative strength of the armies had changed and
that the advantage was now on our side there was a substantial change
in the relative strength and an advance had become inevitable and at
once as a clock begins to strike and chime as soon as the minute hand
has completed a full circle this change was shown by an increased
activity whirring and chiming in the higher spheres





chapter iii

the russian army was commanded by kutúzov and his staff and also by the
emperor from petersburg before the news of the abandonment of moscow
had been received in petersburg a detailed plan of the whole campaign
had been drawn up and sent to kutúzov for his guidance though this plan
had been drawn up on the supposition that moscow was still in our hands
it was approved by the staff and accepted as a basis for action kutúzov
only replied that movements arranged from a distance were always
difficult to execute so fresh instructions were sent for the solution
of difficulties that might be encountered as well as fresh people who
were to watch kutúzovs actions and report upon them

besides this the whole staff of the russian army was now reorganized
the posts left vacant by bagration who had been killed and by barclay
who had gone away in dudgeon had to be filled very serious
consideration was given to the question whether it would be better to
put a in bs place and b in ds or on the contrary to put d in as
place and so onas if anything more than as or bs satisfaction
depended on this

as a result of the hostility between kutúzov and bennigsen his chief of
staff the presence of confidential representatives of the emperor and
these transfers a more than usually complicated play of parties was
going on among the staff of the army a was undermining b d was
undermining c and so on in all possible combinations and permutations
in all these plottings the subject of intrigue was generally the conduct
of the war which all these men believed they were directing but this
affair of the war went on independently of them as it had to go that
is never in the way people devised but flowing always from the
essential attitude of the masses only in the highest spheres did all
these schemes crossings and interminglings appear to be a true
reflection of what had to happen

prince michael ilariónovich wrote the emperor on the second of october
in a letter that reached kutúzov after the battle at tarutino since
september  moscow has been in the hands of the enemy your last reports
were written on the twentieth and during all this time not only has no
action been taken against the enemy or for the relief of the ancient
capital but according to your last report you have even retreated
farther serpukhov is already occupied by an enemy detachment and tula
with its famous arsenal so indispensable to the army is in danger from
general wintzingerodes reports i see that an enemy corps of ten
thousand men is moving on the petersburg road another corps of several
thousand men is moving on dmitrov a third has advanced along the
vladimir road and a fourth rather considerable detachment is stationed
between ruza and mozhaysk napoleon himself was in moscow as late as the
twentyfifth in view of all this information when the enemy has
scattered his forces in large detachments and with napoleon and his
guards in moscow is it possible that the enemys forces confronting you
are so considerable as not to allow of your taking the offensive on the
contrary he is probably pursuing you with detachments or at most with
an army corps much weaker than the army entrusted to you it would seem
that availing yourself of these circumstances you might advantageously
attack a weaker one and annihilate him or at least oblige him to
retreat retaining in our hands an important part of the provinces now
occupied by the enemy and thereby averting danger from tula and other
towns in the interior you will be responsible if the enemy is able to
direct a force of any size against petersburg to threaten this capital
in which it has not been possible to retain many troops for with the
army entrusted to you and acting with resolution and energy you have
ample means to avert this fresh calamity remember that you have still
to answer to our offended country for the loss of moscow you have
experienced my readiness to reward you that readiness will not weaken
in me but i and russia have a right to expect from you all the zeal
firmness and success which your intellect military talent and the
courage of the troops you command justify us in expecting

but by the time this letter which proved that the real relation of the
forces had already made itself felt in petersburg was dispatched
kutúzov had found himself unable any longer to restrain the army he
commanded from attacking and a battle had taken place

on the second of october a cossack shapovalov who was out scouting
killed one hare and wounded another following the wounded hare he made
his way far into the forest and came upon the left flank of murats
army encamped there without any precautions the cossack laughingly
told his comrades how he had almost fallen into the hands of the french
a cornet hearing the story informed his commander

the cossack was sent for and questioned the cossack officers wished to
take advantage of this chance to capture some horses but one of the
superior officers who was acquainted with the higher authorities
reported the incident to a general on the staff the state of things on
the staff had of late been exceedingly strained ermolov had been to see
bennigsen a few days previously and had entreated him to use his
influence with the commanderinchief to induce him to take the
offensive

if i did not know you i should think you did not want what you are
asking for i need only advise anything and his highness is sure to do
the opposite replied bennigsen

the cossacks report confirmed by horse patrols who were sent out was
the final proof that events had matured the tightly coiled spring was
released the clock began to whirr and the chimes to play despite all
his supposed power his intellect his experience and his knowledge of
men kutúzovhaving taken into consideration the cossacks report a
note from bennigsen who sent personal reports to the emperor the wishes
he supposed the emperor to hold and the fact that all the generals
expressed the same wishcould no longer check the inevitable movement
and gave the order to do what he regarded as useless and harmfulgave
his approval that is to the accomplished fact





chapter iv

bennigsens note and the cossacks information that the left flank of
the french was unguarded were merely final indications that it was
necessary to order an attack and it was fixed for the fifth of october

on the morning of the fourth of october kutúzov signed the dispositions
toll read them to ermolov asking him to attend to the further
arrangements

all rightall right i havent time just now replied ermolov and
left the hut

the dispositions drawn up by toll were very good as in the austerlitz
dispositions it was writtenthough not in german this time

the first column will march here and here the second column will
march there and there and so on and on paper all these columns
arrived at their places at the appointed time and destroyed the enemy
everything had been admirably thought out as is usual in dispositions
and as is always the case not a single column reached its place at the
appointed time

when the necessary number of copies of the dispositions had been
prepared an officer was summoned and sent to deliver them to ermolov to
deal with a young officer of the horse guards kutúzovs orderly
pleased at the importance of the mission entrusted to him went to
ermolovs quarters

gone away said ermolovs orderly

the officer of the horse guards went to a general with whom ermolov was
often to be found

no and the generals out too

the officer mounting his horse rode off to someone else

no hes gone out

if only they dont make me responsible for this delay what a nuisance
it is thought the officer and he rode round the whole camp one man
said he had seen ermolov ride past with some other generals others said
he must have returned home the officer searched till six oclock in the
evening without even stopping to eat ermolov was nowhere to be found
and no one knew where he was the officer snatched a little food at a
comrades and rode again to the vanguard to find miloradovich
miloradovich too was away but here he was told that he had gone to a
ball at general kikins and that ermolov was probably there too

but where is it

why there over at echkino said a cossack officer pointing to a
country house in the far distance

what outside our line

theyve put two regiments as outposts and theyre having such a spree
there its awful two bands and three sets of singers

the officer rode out beyond our lines to echkino while still at a
distance he heard as he rode the merry sounds of a soldiers dance song
proceeding from the house

in the meadows in the meadows he heard accompanied by whistling
and the sound of a torban drowned every now and then by shouts these
sounds made his spirits rise but at the same time he was afraid that he
would be blamed for not having executed sooner the important order
entrusted to him it was already past eight oclock he dismounted and
went up into the porch of a large country house which had remained
intact between the russian and french forces in the refreshment room
and the hall footmen were bustling about with wine and viands groups
of singers stood outside the windows the officer was admitted and
immediately saw all the chief generals of the army together and among
them ermolovs big imposing figure they all had their coats unbuttoned
and were standing in a semicircle with flushed and animated faces
laughing loudly in the middle of the room a short handsome general with
a red face was dancing the trepak with much spirit and agility

ha ha ha bravo nicholas ivanych ha ha ha

the officer felt that by arriving with important orders at such a moment
he was doubly to blame and he would have preferred to wait but one of
the generals espied him and hearing what he had come about informed
ermolov

ermolov came forward with a frown on his face and hearing what the
officer had to say took the papers from him without a word

you think he went off just by chance said a comrade who was on the
staff that evening to the officer of the horse guards referring to
ermolov it was a trick it was done on purpose to get konovnitsyn into
trouble youll see what a mess therell be tomorrow





chapter v

next day the decrepit kutúzov having given orders to be called early
said his prayers dressed and with an unpleasant consciousness of
having to direct a battle he did not approve of got into his caleche
and drove from letashovka a village three and a half miles from
tarutino to the place where the attacking columns were to meet he sat
in the caleche dozing and waking up by turns and listening for any
sound of firing on the right as an indication that the action had begun
but all was still quiet a damp dull autumn morning was just dawning on
approaching tarutino kutúzov noticed cavalrymen leading their horses to
water across the road along which he was driving kutúzov looked at them
searchingly stopped his carriage and inquired what regiment they
belonged to they belonged to a column that should have been far in
front and in ambush long before then it may be a mistake thought the
old commanderinchief but a little further on he saw infantry
regiments with their arms piled and the soldiers only partly dressed
eating their rye porridge and carrying fuel he sent for an officer the
officer reported that no order to advance had been received

how not rec kutúzov began but checked himself immediately and
sent for a senior officer getting out of his caleche he waited with
drooping head and breathing heavily pacing silently up and down when
eykhen the officer of the general staff whom he had summoned appeared
kutúzov went purple in the face not because that officer was to blame
for the mistake but because he was an object of sufficient importance
for him to vent his wrath on trembling and panting the old man fell
into that state of fury in which he sometimes used to roll on the
ground and he fell upon eykhen threatening him with his hands
shouting and loading him with gross abuse another man captain brozin
who happened to turn up and who was not at all to blame suffered the
same fate

what sort of another blackguard are you ill have you shot
scoundrels yelled kutúzov in a hoarse voice waving his arms and
reeling

he was suffering physically he the commanderinchief a serene
highness who everybody said possessed powers such as no man had ever had
in russia to be placed in this positionmade the laughingstock of the
whole army i neednt have been in such a hurry to pray about today or
have kept awake thinking everything over all night thought he to
himself when i was a chit of an officer no one would have dared to
mock me so and now he was in a state of physical suffering as if
from corporal punishment and could not avoid expressing it by cries of
anger and distress but his strength soon began to fail him and looking
about him conscious of having said much that was amiss he again got
into his caleche and drove back in silence

his wrath once expended did not return and blinking feebly he
listened to excuses and selfjustifications ermolov did not come to see
him till the next day and to the insistence of bennigsen konovnitsyn
and toll that the movement that had miscarried should be executed next
day and once more kutúzov had to consent





chapter vi

next day the troops assembled in their appointed places in the evening
and advanced during the night it was an autumn night with dark purple
clouds but no rain the ground was damp but not muddy and the troops
advanced noiselessly only occasionally a jingling of the artillery
could be faintly heard the men were forbidden to talk out loud to
smoke their pipes or to strike a light and they tried to prevent their
horses neighing the secrecy of the undertaking heightened its charm and
they marched gaily some columns supposing they had reached their
destination halted piled arms and settled down on the cold ground
but the majority marched all night and arrived at places where they
evidently should not have been

only count orlóvdenisov with his cossacks the least important
detachment of all got to his appointed place at the right time this
detachment halted at the outskirts of a forest on the path leading from
the village of stromilova to dmitrovsk

toward dawn count orlóvdenisov who had dozed off was awakened by a
deserter from the french army being brought to him this was a polish
sergeant of poniatowskis corps who explained in polish that he had
come over because he had been slighted in the service that he ought
long ago to have been made an officer that he was braver than any of
them and so he had left them and wished to pay them out he said that
murat was spending the night less than a mile from where they were and
that if they would let him have a convoy of a hundred men he would
capture him alive count orlóvdenisov consulted his fellow officers

the offer was too tempting to be refused everyone volunteered to go and
everybody advised making the attempt after much disputing and arguing
majorgeneral grekov with two cossack regiments decided to go with the
polish sergeant

now remember said count orlóvdenisov to the sergeant at parting
if you have been lying ill have you hanged like a dog but if its
true you shall have a hundred gold pieces

without replying the sergeant with a resolute air mounted and rode
away with grekov whose men had quickly assembled they disappeared into
the forest and count orlóvdenisov having seen grekov off returned
shivering from the freshness of the early dawn and excited by what he
had undertaken on his own responsibility and began looking at the enemy
camp now just visible in the deceptive light of dawn and the dying
campfires our columns ought to have begun to appear on an open
declivity to his right he looked in that direction but though the
columns would have been visible quite far off they were not to be seen
it seemed to the count that things were beginning to stir in the french
camp and his keensighted adjutant confirmed this

oh it is really too late said count orlóv looking at the camp

as often happens when someone we have trusted is no longer before our
eyes it suddenly seemed quite clear and obvious to him that the
sergeant was an impostor that he had lied and that the whole russian
attack would be ruined by the absence of those two regiments which he
would lead away heaven only knew where how could one capture a
commanderinchief from among such a mass of troops

i am sure that rascal was lying said the count

they can still be called back said one of his suite who like count
orlóv felt distrustful of the adventure when he looked at the enemys
camp

eh really what do you think should we let them go on or not

will you have them fetched back

fetch them back fetch them back said count orlóv with sudden
determination looking at his watch it will be too late it is quite
light

and the adjutant galloped through the forest after grekov when grekov
returned count orlóvdenisov excited both by the abandoned attempt and
by vainly awaiting the infantry columns that still did not appear as
well as by the proximity of the enemy resolved to advance all his men
felt the same excitement

mount he commanded in a whisper the men took their places and
crossed themselves forward with gods aid

hurrahahah reverberated in the forest and the cossack companies
trailing their lances and advancing one after another as if poured out
of a sack dashed gaily across the brook toward the camp

one desperate frightened yell from the first french soldier who saw the
cossacks and all who were in the camp undressed and only just waking
up ran off in all directions abandoning cannons muskets and horses

had the cossacks pursued the french without heeding what was behind and
around them they would have captured murat and everything there that
was what the officers desired but it was impossible to make the
cossacks budge when once they had got booty and prisoners none of them
listened to orders fifteen hundred prisoners and thirtyeight guns were
taken on the spot besides standards and what seemed most important to
the cossacks horses saddles horsecloths and the like all this had
to be dealt with the prisoners and guns secured the booty dividednot
without some shouting and even a little fighting among themselvesand it
was on this that the cossacks all busied themselves

the french not being farther pursued began to recover themselves they
formed into detachments and began firing orlóvdenisov still waiting
for the other columns to arrive advanced no further

meantime according to the dispositions which said that the first
column will march and so on the infantry of the belated columns
commanded by bennigsen and directed by toll had started in due order
and as always happens had got somewhere but not to their appointed
places as always happens the men starting cheerfully began to halt
murmurs were heard there was a sense of confusion and finally a
backward movement adjutants and generals galloped about shouted grew
angry quarreled said they had come quite wrong and were late gave
vent to a little abuse and at last gave it all up and went forward
simply to get somewhere we shall get somewhere or other and they did
indeed get somewhere though not to their right places a few eventually
even got to their right place but too late to be of any use and only in
time to be fired at toll who in this battle played the part of
weyrother at austerlitz galloped assiduously from place to place
finding everything upside down everywhere thus he stumbled on bagovuts
corps in a wood when it was already broad daylight though the corps
should long before have joined orlóvdenisov excited and vexed by the
failure and supposing that someone must be responsible for it toll
galloped up to the commander of the corps and began upbraiding him
severely saying that he ought to be shot general bagovut a fighting
old soldier of placid temperament being also upset by all the delay
confusion and crosspurposes fell into a rage to everybodys surprise
and quite contrary to his usual character and said disagreeable things
to toll

i prefer not to take lessons from anyone but i can die with my men as
well as anybody he said and advanced with a single division

coming out onto a field under the enemys fire this brave general went
straight ahead leading his men under fire without considering in his
agitation whether going into action now with a single division would
be of any use or no danger cannon balls and bullets were just what he
needed in his angry mood one of the first bullets killed him and other
bullets killed many of his men and his division remained under fire for
some time quite uselessly





chapter vii

meanwhile another column was to have attacked the french from the front
but kutúzov accompanied that column he well knew that nothing but
confusion would come of this battle undertaken against his will and as
far as was in his power held the troops back he did not advance

he rode silently on his small gray horse indolently answering
suggestions that they should attack

the word attack is always on your tongue but you dont see that we are
unable to execute complicated maneuvers said he to miloradovich who
asked permission to advance

we couldnt take murat prisoner this morning or get to the place in
time and nothing can be done now he replied to someone else

when kutúzov was informed that at the french rearwhere according to the
reports of the cossacks there had previously been nobodythere were now
two battalions of poles he gave a sidelong glance at ermolov who was
behind him and to whom he had not spoken since the previous day

you see they are asking to attack and making plans of all kinds but
as soon as one gets to business nothing is ready and the enemy
forewarned takes measures accordingly

ermolov screwed up his eyes and smiled faintly on hearing these words
he understood that for him the storm had blown over and that kutúzov
would content himself with that hint

hes having a little fun at my expense said ermolov softly nudging
with his knee raevski who was at his side

soon after this ermolov moved up to kutúzov and respectfully remarked

it is not too late yet your highnessthe enemy has not gone awayif
you were to order an attack if not the guards will not so much as see
a little smoke

kutúzov did not reply but when they reported to him that murats troops
were in retreat he ordered an advance though at every hundred paces he
halted for three quarters of an hour

the whole battle consisted in what orlóvdenisovs cossacks had done
the rest of the army merely lost some hundreds of men uselessly

in consequence of this battle kutúzov received a diamond decoration and
bennigsen some diamonds and a hundred thousand rubles others also
received pleasant recognitions corresponding to their various grades
and following the battle fresh changes were made in the staff

thats how everything is done with us all topsyturvy said the
russian officers and generals after the tarutino battle letting it be
understood that some fool there is doing things all wrong but that we
ourselves should not have done so just as people speak today but
people who talk like that either do not know what they are talking about
or deliberately deceive themselves no battletarutino borodino or
austerlitztakes place as those who planned it anticipated that is an
essential condition

a countless number of free forces for nowhere is man freer than during
a battle where it is a question of life and death influence the course
taken by the fight and that course never can be known in advance and
never coincides with the direction of any one force

if many simultaneously and variously directed forces act on a given
body the direction of its motion cannot coincide with any one of those
forces but will always be a meanwhat in mechanics is represented by
the diagonal of a parallelogram of forces

if in the descriptions given by historians especially french ones we
find their wars and battles carried out in accordance with previously
formed plans the only conclusion to be drawn is that those descriptions
are false

the battle of tarutino obviously did not attain the aim toll had in
viewto lead the troops into action in the order prescribed by the
dispositions nor that which count orlóvdenisov may have had in viewto
take murat prisoner nor the result of immediately destroying the whole
corps which bennigsen and others may have had in view nor the aim of
the officer who wished to go into action to distinguish himself nor
that of the cossack who wanted more booty than he got and so on but if
the aim of the battle was what actually resulted and what all the
russians of that day desiredto drive the french out of russia and
destroy their armyit is quite clear that the battle of tarutino just
because of its incongruities was exactly what was wanted at that stage
of the campaign it would be difficult and even impossible to imagine
any result more opportune than the actual outcome of this battle with a
minimum of effort and insignificant losses despite the greatest
confusion the most important results of the whole campaign were
attained the transition from retreat to advance an exposure of the
weakness of the french and the administration of that shock which
napoleons army had only awaited to begin its flight





chapter viii

napoleon enters moscow after the brilliant victory de la moskowa there
can be no doubt about the victory for the battlefield remains in the
hands of the french the russians retreat and abandon their ancient
capital moscow abounding in provisions arms munitions and
incalculable wealth is in napoleons hands the russian army only half
the strength of the french does not make a single attempt to attack for
a whole month napoleons position is most brilliant he can either fall
on the russian army with double its strength and destroy it negotiate
an advantageous peace or in case of a refusal make a menacing move on
petersburg or even in the case of a reverse return to smolensk or
vilna or remain in moscow in short no special genius would seem to be
required to retain the brilliant position the french held at that time
for that only very simple and easy steps were necessary not to allow
the troops to loot to prepare winter clothingof which there was
sufficient in moscow for the whole armyand methodically to collect the
provisions of which according to the french historians there were
enough in moscow to supply the whole army for six months yet napoleon
that greatest of all geniuses who the historians declare had control of
the army took none of these steps

he not merely did nothing of the kind but on the contrary he used his
power to select the most foolish and ruinous of all the courses open to
him of all that napoleon might have done wintering in moscow
advancing on petersburg or on nizhninovgorod or retiring by a more
northerly or more southerly route say by the road kutúzov afterwards
took nothing more stupid or disastrous can be imagined than what he
actually did he remained in moscow till october letting the troops
plunder the city then hesitating whether to leave a garrison behind
him he quitted moscow approached kutúzov without joining battle
turned to the right and reached maloyaroslavets again without
attempting to break through and take the road kutúzov took but retiring
instead to mozhaysk along the devastated smolensk road nothing more
stupid than that could have been devised or more disastrous for the
army as the sequel showed had napoleons aim been to destroy his army
the most skillful strategist could hardly have devised any series of
actions that would so completely have accomplished that purpose
independently of anything the russian army might do

napoleon the man of genius did this but to say that he destroyed his
army because he wished to or because he was very stupid would be as
unjust as to say that he had brought his troops to moscow because he
wished to and because he was very clever and a genius

in both cases his personal activity having no more force than the
personal activity of any soldier merely coincided with the laws that
guided the event

the historians quite falsely represent napoleons faculties as having
weakened in moscow and do so only because the results did not justify
his actions he employed all his ability and strength to do the best he
could for himself and his army as he had done previously and as he did
subsequently in  his activity at that time was no less astounding
than it was in egypt in italy in austria and in prussia we do not
know for certain in how far his genius was genuine in egyptwhere forty
centuries looked down upon his grandeurfor his great exploits there are
all told us by frenchmen we cannot accurately estimate his genius in
austria or prussia for we have to draw our information from french or
german sources and the incomprehensible surrender of whole corps
without fighting and of fortresses without a siege must incline germans
to recognize his genius as the only explanation of the war carried on in
germany but we thank god have no need to recognize his genius in
order to hide our shame we have paid for the right to look at the
matter plainly and simply and we will not abandon that right

his activity in moscow was as amazing and as full of genius as
elsewhere order after order and plan after plan were issued by him from
the time he entered moscow till the time he left it the absence of
citizens and of a deputation and even the burning of moscow did not
disconcert him he did not lose sight either of the welfare of his army
or of the doings of the enemy or of the welfare of the people of
russia or of the direction of affairs in paris or of diplomatic
considerations concerning the terms of the anticipated peace





chapter ix

with regard to military matters napoleon immediately on his entry into
moscow gave general sabastiani strict orders to observe the movements of
the russian army sent army corps out along the different roads and
charged murat to find kutúzov then he gave careful directions about the
fortification of the kremlin and drew up a brilliant plan for a future
campaign over the whole map of russia

with regard to diplomatic questions napoleon summoned captain yakovlev
who had been robbed and was in rags and did not know how to get out of
moscow minutely explained to him his whole policy and his magnanimity
and having written a letter to the emperor alexander in which he
considered it his duty to inform his friend and brother that rostopchin
had managed affairs badly in moscow he dispatched yakovlev to
petersburg

having similarly explained his views and his magnanimity to tutolmin he
dispatched that old man also to petersburg to negotiate

with regard to legal matters immediately after the fires he gave orders
to find and execute the incendiaries and the scoundrel rostopchin was
punished by an order to burn down his houses

with regard to administrative matters moscow was granted a
constitution a municipality was established and the following
announcement issued

inhabitants of moscow

to arrest their course terrible examples have taught you how he
punishes disobedience and crime strict measures have been taken to put

defeat the intentions of the evilminded obey the military and civil
authorities and your tears will soon cease to flow

with regard to supplies for the army napoleon decreed that all the
troops in turn should enter moscow a la maraude  to obtain provisions
for themselves so that the army might have its future provided for

 as looters

with regard to religion napoleon ordered the priests to be brought back
and services to be again performed in the churches

with regard to commerce and to provisioning the army the following was
placarded everywhere

proclamation

misfortune has driven from the city and you scattered tillers of the

supplies of all kinds to two appointed markets of which one is on the
mokhovaya street and the other at the provision market  such

as the chief market days and to that end a sufficient number of troops
will be stationed along the highroads on tuesdays and saturdays at such
distances from the town as to protect the carts  similar measures
will be taken that peasants with their carts and horses may meet with no
hindrance on their return journey  steps will immediately be taken
to reestablish ordinary trading

inhabitants of the city and villages and you workingmen and artisans
to whatever nation you belong you are called on to carry out the
paternal intentions of his majesty the emperor and king and to co
operate with him for the public welfare lay your respect and confidence
at his feet and do not delay to unite with us

with the object of raising the spirits of the troops and of the people
reviews were constantly held and rewards distributed the emperor rode
through the streets to comfort the inhabitants and despite his
preoccupation with state affairs himself visited the theaters that were
established by his order

in regard to philanthropy the greatest virtue of crowned heads
napoleon also did all in his power he caused the words maison de ma
mere to be inscribed on the charitable institutions thereby combining
tender filial affection with the majestic benevolence of a monarch he
visited the foundling hospital and allowing the orphans saved by him to
kiss his white hands graciously conversed with tutolmin then as
thiers eloquently recounts he ordered his soldiers to be paid in forged
russian money which he had prepared raising the use of these means by
an act worthy of himself and of the french army he let relief be
distributed to those who had been burned out but as food was too
precious to be given to foreigners who were for the most part enemies
napoleon preferred to supply them with money with which to purchase food
from outside and had paper rubles distributed to them

with reference to army discipline orders were continually being issued
to inflict severe punishment for the nonperformance of military duties
and to suppress robbery





chapter x

but strange to say all these measures efforts and planswhich were
not at all worse than others issued in similar circumstancesdid not
affect the essence of the matter but like the hands of a clock detached
from the mechanism swung about in an arbitrary and aimless way without
engaging the cogwheels

with reference to the military sidethe plan of campaignthat work of
genius of which thiers remarks that his genius never devised anything
more profound more skillful or more admirable and enters into a
polemic with m fain to prove that this work of genius must be referred
not to the fourth but to the fifteenth of octoberthat plan never was or
could be executed for it was quite out of touch with the facts of the
case the fortifying of the kremlin for which la mosquee as napoleon
termed the church of basil the beatified was to have been razed to the
ground proved quite useless the mining of the kremlin only helped
toward fulfilling napoleons wish that it should be blown up when he
left moscowas a child wants the floor on which he has hurt himself to
be beaten the pursuit of the russian army about which napoleon was so
concerned produced an unheardof result the french generals lost touch
with the russian army of sixty thousand men and according to thiers it
was only eventually found like a lost pin by the skilland apparently
the geniusof murat

with reference to diplomacy all napoleons arguments as to his
magnanimity and justice both to tutolmin and to yakovlev whose chief
concern was to obtain a greatcoat and a conveyance proved useless
alexander did not receive these envoys and did not reply to their
embassage

with regard to legal matters after the execution of the supposed
incendiaries the rest of moscow burned down

with regard to administrative matters the establishment of a
municipality did not stop the robberies and was only of use to certain
people who formed part of that municipality and under pretext of
preserving order looted moscow or saved their own property from being
looted

with regard to religion as to which in egypt matters had so easily been
settled by napoleons visit to a mosque no results were achieved two
or three priests who were found in moscow did try to carry out
napoleons wish but one of them was slapped in the face by a french
soldier while conducting service and a french official reported of
another that the priest whom i found and invited to say mass cleaned
and locked up the church that night the doors were again broken open
the padlocks smashed the books mutilated and other disorders
perpetrated

with reference to commerce the proclamation to industrious workmen and
to peasants evoked no response there were no industrious workmen and
the peasants caught the commissaries who ventured too far out of town
with the proclamation and killed them

as to the theaters for the entertainment of the people and the troops
these did not meet with success either the theaters set up in the
kremlin and in posnyakovs house were closed again at once because the
actors and actresses were robbed

even philanthropy did not have the desired effect the genuine as well
as the false paper money which flooded moscow lost its value the
french collecting booty cared only for gold not only was the paper
money valueless which napoleon so graciously distributed to the
unfortunate but even silver lost its value in relation to gold

but the most amazing example of the ineffectiveness of the orders given
by the authorities at that time was napoleons attempt to stop the
looting and reestablish discipline

this is what the army authorities were reporting

looting continues in the city despite the decrees against it order is
not yet restored and not a single merchant is carrying on trade in a
lawful manner the sutlers alone venture to trade and they sell stolen
goods

the neighborhood of my ward continues to be pillaged by soldiers of the
rd corps who not satisfied with taking from the unfortunate
inhabitants hiding in the cellars the little they have left even have
the ferocity to wound them with their sabers as i have repeatedly
witnessed

nothing new except that the soldiers are robbing and pillagingoctober


robbery and pillaging continue there is a band of thieves in our
district who ought to be arrested by a strong forceoctober

the emperor is extremely displeased that despite the strict orders to
stop pillage parties of marauding guards are continually seen returning
to the kremlin among the old guard disorder and pillage were renewed
more violently than ever yesterday evening last night and today the
emperor sees with regret that the picked soldiers appointed to guard his
person who should set an example of discipline carry disobedience to
such a point that they break into the cellars and stores containing army
supplies others have disgraced themselves to the extent of disobeying
sentinels and officers and have abused and beaten them

the grand marshal of the palace wrote the governor complains
bitterly that in spite of repeated orders the soldiers continue to
commit nuisances in all the courtyards and even under the very windows
of the emperor

that army like a herd of cattle run wild and trampling underfoot the
provender which might have saved it from starvation disintegrated and
perished with each additional day it remained in moscow but it did not
go away

it began to run away only when suddenly seized by a panic caused by the
capture of transport trains on the smolensk road and by the battle of
tarutino the news of that battle of tarutino unexpectedly received by
napoleon at a review evoked in him a desire to punish the russians
thiers says and he issued the order for departure which the whole
army was demanding

fleeing from moscow the soldiers took with them everything they had
stolen napoleon too carried away his own personal tresor but on
seeing the baggage trains that impeded the army he was thiers says
horrorstruck and yet with his experience of war he did not order all
the superfluous vehicles to be burned as he had done with those of a
certain marshal when approaching moscow he gazed at the caleches and
carriages in which soldiers were riding and remarked that it was a very
good thing as those vehicles could be used to carry provisions the
sick and the wounded

the plight of the whole army resembled that of a wounded animal which
feels it is perishing and does not know what it is doing to study the
skillful tactics and aims of napoleon and his army from the time it
entered moscow till it was destroyed is like studying the dying leaps
and shudders of a mortally wounded animal very often a wounded animal
hearing a rustle rushes straight at the hunters gun runs forward and
back again and hastens its own end napoleon under pressure from his
whole army did the same thing the rustle of the battle of tarutino
frightened the beast and it rushed forward onto the hunters gun
reached him turned back and finallylike any wild beastran back along
the most disadvantageous and dangerous path where the old scent was
familiar

during the whole of that period napoleon who seems to us to have been
the leader of all these movementsas the figurehead of a ship may seem
to a savage to guide the vesselacted like a child who holding a couple
of strings inside a carriage thinks he is driving it





chapter xi

early in the morning of the sixth of october pierre went out of the
shed and on returning stopped by the door to play with a little blue
gray dog with a long body and short bandy legs that jumped about him
this little dog lived in their shed sleeping beside karataev at night
it sometimes made excursions into the town but always returned again
probably it had never had an owner and it still belonged to nobody and
had no name the french called it azor the soldier who told stories
called it femgalka karataev and others called it gray or sometimes
flabby its lack of a master a name or even of a breed or any definite
color did not seem to trouble the bluegray dog in the least its furry
tail stood up firm and round as a plume its bandy legs served it so
well that it would often gracefully lift a hind leg and run very easily
and quickly on three legs as if disdaining to use all four everything
pleased it now it would roll on its back yelping with delight now
bask in the sun with a thoughtful air of importance and now frolic
about playing with a chip of wood or a straw

pierres attire by now consisted of a dirty torn shirt the only remnant
of his former clothing a pair of soldiers trousers which by
karataevs advice he tied with string round the ankles for warmth and a
peasant coat and cap physically he had changed much during this time
he no longer seemed stout though he still had the appearance of
solidity and strength hereditary in his family a beard and mustache
covered the lower part of his face and a tangle of hair infested with
lice curled round his head like a cap the look of his eyes was
resolute calm and animatedly alert as never before the former
slackness which had shown itself even in his eyes was now replaced by an
energetic readiness for action and resistance his feet were bare

pierre first looked down the field across which vehicles and horsemen
were passing that morning then into the distance across the river then
at the dog who was pretending to be in earnest about biting him and
then at his bare feet which he placed with pleasure in various
positions moving his dirty thick big toes every time he looked at his
bare feet a smile of animated selfsatisfaction flitted across his face
the sight of them reminded him of all he had experienced and learned
during these weeks and this recollection was pleasant to him

for some days the weather had been calm and clear with slight frosts in
the morningswhat is called an old wives summer

in the sunshine the air was warm and that warmth was particularly
pleasant with the invigorating freshness of the morning frost still in
the air

on everythingfar and nearlay the magic crystal glitter seen only at
that time of autumn the sparrow hills were visible in the distance
with the village the church and the large white house the bare trees
the sand the bricks and roofs of the houses the green church spire
and the corners of the white house in the distance all stood out in the
transparent air in most delicate outline and with unnatural clearness
near by could be seen the familiar ruins of a halfburned mansion
occupied by the french with lilac bushes still showing dark green
beside the fence and even that ruined and befouled housewhich in dull
weather was repulsively uglyseemed quietly beautiful now in the clear
motionless brilliance

a french corporal with coat unbuttoned in a homely way a skullcap on
his head and a short pipe in his mouth came from behind a corner of
the shed and approached pierre with a friendly wink

what sunshine monsieur kiril their name for pierre eh just like
spring

and the corporal leaned against the door and offered pierre his pipe
though whenever he offered it pierre always declined it

to be on the march in such weather he began

pierre inquired what was being said about leaving and the corporal told
him that nearly all the troops were starting and there ought to be an
order about the prisoners that day sokolov one of the soldiers in the
shed with pierre was dying and pierre told the corporal that something
should be done about him the corporal replied that pierre need not
worry about that as they had an ambulance and a permanent hospital and
arrangements would be made for the sick and that in general everything
that could happen had been foreseen by the authorities

besides monsieur kiril you have only to say a word to the captain
you know he is a man who never forgets anything speak to the captain
when he makes his round he will do anything for you

the captain of whom the corporal spoke often had long chats with pierre
and showed him all sorts of favors

you see st thomas he said to me the other day monsieur kiril is
a man of education who speaks french he is a russian seigneur who has
had misfortunes but he is a man he knows whats what if he wants
anything and asks me he wont get a refusal when one has studied you
see one likes education and wellbred people it is for your sake i
mention it monsieur kiril the other day if it had not been for you
that affair would have ended ill

and after chatting a while longer the corporal went away the affair
he had alluded to had happened a few days beforea fight between the
prisoners and the french soldiers in which pierre had succeeded in
pacifying his comrades some of the prisoners who had heard pierre
talking to the corporal immediately asked what the frenchman had said
while pierre was repeating what he had been told about the army leaving
moscow a thin sallow tattered french soldier came up to the door of
the shed rapidly and timidly raising his fingers to his forehead by way
of greeting he asked pierre whether the soldier platoche to whom he had
given a shirt to sew was in that shed

a week before the french had had boot leather and linen issued to them
which they had given out to the prisoners to make up into boots and
shirts for them

ready ready dear fellow said karataev coming out with a neatly
folded shirt

karataev on account of the warm weather and for convenience at work
was wearing only trousers and a tattered shirt as black as soot his
hair was bound round workman fashion with a wisp of limetree bast
and his round face seemed rounder and pleasanter than ever

a promise is own brother to performance i said friday and here it is
ready said platon smiling and unfolding the shirt he had sewn

the frenchman glanced around uneasily and then as if overcoming his
hesitation rapidly threw off his uniform and put on the shirt he had a
long greasy flowered silk waistcoat next to his sallow thin bare
body but no shirt he was evidently afraid the prisoners looking on
would laugh at him and thrust his head into the shirt hurriedly none
of the prisoners said a word

see it fits well platon kept repeating pulling the shirt straight

the frenchman having pushed his head and hands through without raising
his eyes looked down at the shirt and examined the seams

you see dear man this is not a sewing shop and i had no proper
tools and as they say one needs a tool even to kill a louse said
platon with one of his round smiles obviously pleased with his work

its good quite good thank you said the frenchman in french but
there must be some linen left over

it will fit better still when it sets to your body said karataev
still admiring his handiwork youll be nice and comfortable

thanks thanks old fellow but the bits left over said the
frenchman again and smiled he took out an assignation ruble note and
gave it to karataev but give me the pieces that are over

pierre saw that platon did not want to understand what the frenchman was
saying and he looked on without interfering karataev thanked the
frenchman for the money and went on admiring his own work the frenchman
insisted on having the pieces returned that were left over and asked
pierre to translate what he said

what does he want the bits for said karataev theyd make fine leg
bands for us well never mind

and karataev with a suddenly changed and saddened expression took a
small bundle of scraps from inside his shirt and gave it to the
frenchman without looking at him oh dear muttered karataev and went
away the frenchman looked at the linen considered for a moment then
looked inquiringly at pierre and as if pierres look had told him
something suddenly blushed and shouted in a squeaky voice

platoche eh platoche keep them yourself and handing back the odd
bits he turned and went out

there look at that said karataev swaying his head people said
they were not christians but they too have souls its what the old
folk used to say a sweating hands an open hand a dry hands close
hes naked but yet hes given it back

karataev smiled thoughtfully and was silent awhile looking at the
pieces

but theyll make grand leg bands dear friend he said and went back
into the shed





chapter xii

four weeks had passed since pierre had been taken prisoner and though
the french had offered to move him from the mens to the officers shed
he had stayed in the shed where he was first put

in burned and devastated moscow pierre experienced almost the extreme
limits of privation a man can endure but thanks to his physical
strength and health of which he had till then been unconscious and
thanks especially to the fact that the privations came so gradually that
it was impossible to say when they began he endured his position not
only lightly but joyfully and just at this time he obtained the
tranquillity and ease of mind he had formerly striven in vain to reach
he had long sought in different ways that tranquillity of mind that
inner harmony which had so impressed him in the soldiers at the battle
of borodino he had sought it in philanthropy in freemasonry in the
dissipations of town life in wine in heroic feats of selfsacrifice
and in romantic love for natásha he had sought it by reasoningand all
these quests and experiments had failed him and now without thinking
about it he had found that peace and inner harmony only through the
horror of death through privation and through what he recognized in
karataev

those dreadful moments he had lived through at the executions had as it
were forever washed away from his imagination and memory the agitating
thoughts and feelings that had formerly seemed so important it did not
now occur to him to think of russia or the war or politics or
napoleon it was plain to him that all these things were no business of
his and that he was not called on to judge concerning them and
therefore could not do so russia and summer weather are not bound
together he thought repeating words of karataevs which he found
strangely consoling his intention of killing napoleon and his
calculations of the cabalistic number of the beast of the apocalypse now
seemed to him meaningless and even ridiculous his anger with his wife
and anxiety that his name should not be smirched now seemed not merely
trivial but even amusing what concern was it of his that somewhere or
other that woman was leading the life she preferred what did it matter
to anybody and especially to him whether or not they found out that
their prisoners name was count bezúkhov

he now often remembered his conversation with prince andrew and quite
agreed with him though he understood prince andrews thoughts somewhat
differently prince andrew had thought and said that happiness could
only be negative but had said it with a shade of bitterness and irony
as though he was really saying that all desire for positive happiness is
implanted in us merely to torment us and never be satisfied but pierre
believed it without any mental reservation the absence of suffering
the satisfaction of ones needs and consequent freedom in the choice of
ones occupation that is of ones way of life now seemed to pierre to
be indubitably mans highest happiness here and now for the first time
he fully appreciated the enjoyment of eating when he wanted to eat
drinking when he wanted to drink sleeping when he wanted to sleep of
warmth when he was cold of talking to a fellow man when he wished to
talk and to hear a human voice the satisfaction of ones needsgood
food cleanliness and freedomnow that he was deprived of all this
seemed to pierre to constitute perfect happiness and the choice of
occupation that is of his way of lifenow that that was so
restrictedseemed to him such an easy matter that he forgot that a
superfluity of the comforts of life destroys all joy in satisfying ones
needs while great freedom in the choice of occupationsuch freedom as
his wealth his education and his social position had given him in his
own lifeis just what makes the choice of occupation insolubly difficult
and destroys the desire and possibility of having an occupation

all pierres daydreams now turned on the time when he would be free yet
subsequently and for the rest of his life he thought and spoke with
enthusiasm of that month of captivity of those irrecoverable strong
joyful sensations and chiefly of the complete peace of mind and inner
freedom which he experienced only during those weeks

when on the first day he got up early went out of the shed at dawn and
saw the cupolas and crosses of the new convent of the virgin still dark
at first the hoarfrost on the dusty grass the sparrow hills and the
wooded banks above the winding river vanishing in the purple distance
when he felt the contact of the fresh air and heard the noise of the
crows flying from moscow across the field and when afterwards light
gleamed from the east and the suns rim appeared solemnly from behind a
cloud and the cupolas and crosses the hoarfrost the distance and the
river all began to sparkle in the glad lightpierre felt a new joy and
strength in life such as he had never before known and this not only
stayed with him during the whole of his imprisonment but even grew in
strength as the hardships of his position increased

that feeling of alertness and of readiness for anything was still
further strengthened in him by the high opinion his fellow prisoners
formed of him soon after his arrival at the shed with his knowledge of
languages the respect shown him by the french his simplicity his
readiness to give anything asked of him he received the allowance of
three rubles a week made to officers with his strength which he
showed to the soldiers by pressing nails into the walls of the hut his
gentleness to his companions and his capacity for sitting still and
thinking without doing anything which seemed to them incomprehensible
he appeared to them a rather mysterious and superior being the very
qualities that had been a hindrance if not actually harmful to him in
the world he had lived inhis strength his disdain for the comforts of
life his absentmindedness and simplicityhere among these people gave
him almost the status of a hero and pierre felt that their opinion
placed responsibilities upon him





chapter xiii

the french evacuation began on the night between the sixth and seventh
of october kitchens and sheds were dismantled carts loaded and troops
and baggage trains started

at seven in the morning a french convoy in marching trim wearing shakos
and carrying muskets knapsacks and enormous sacks stood in front of
the sheds and animated french talk mingled with curses sounded all
along the lines

in the shed everyone was ready dressed belted shod and only awaited
the order to start the sick soldier sokolov pale and thin with dark
shadows round his eyes alone sat in his place barefoot and not dressed
his eyes prominent from the emaciation of his face gazed inquiringly
at his comrades who were paying no attention to him and he moaned
regularly and quietly it was evidently not so much his sufferings that
caused him to moan he had dysentery as his fear and grief at being
left alone

pierre girt with a rope round his waist and wearing shoes karataev had
made for him from some leather a french soldier had torn off a tea chest
and brought to have his boots mended with went up to the sick man and
squatted down beside him

you know sokolov they are not all going away they have a hospital
here you may be better off than we others said pierre

o lord oh it will be the death of me o lord moaned the man in a
louder voice

ill go and ask them again directly said pierre rising and going to
the door of the shed

just as pierre reached the door the corporal who had offered him a pipe
the day before came up to it with two soldiers the corporal and
soldiers were in marching kit with knapsacks and shakos that had metal
straps and these changed their familiar faces

the corporal came according to orders to shut the door the prisoners
had to be counted before being let out

corporal what will they do with the sick man pierre began

but even as he spoke he began to doubt whether this was the corporal he
knew or a stranger so unlike himself did the corporal seem at that
moment moreover just as pierre was speaking a sharp rattle of drums
was suddenly heard from both sides the corporal frowned at pierres
words and uttering some meaningless oaths slammed the door the shed
became semidark and the sharp rattle of the drums on two sides drowned
the sick mans groans

there it is it again said pierre to himself and an
involuntary shudder ran down his spine in the corporals changed face
in the sound of his voice in the stirring and deafening noise of the
drums he recognized that mysterious callous force which compelled
people against their will to kill their fellow menthat force the effect
of which he had witnessed during the executions to fear or to try to
escape that force to address entreaties or exhortations to those who
served as its tools was useless pierre knew this now one had to wait
and endure he did not again go to the sick man nor turn to look at
him but stood frowning by the door of the hut

when that door was opened and the prisoners crowding against one
another like a flock of sheep squeezed into the exit pierre pushed his
way forward and approached that very captain who as the corporal had
assured him was ready to do anything for him the captain was also in
marching kit and on his cold face appeared that same it which pierre
had recognized in the corporals words and in the roll of the drums

pass on pass on the captain reiterated frowning sternly and
looking at the prisoners who thronged past him

pierre went up to him though he knew his attempt would be vain

what now the officer asked with a cold look as if not recognizing
pierre

pierre told him about the sick man

hell manage to walk devil take him said the captain pass on pass
on he continued without looking at pierre

but he is dying pierre again began

be so good shouted the captain frowning angrily

dramdadadam damdam rattled the drums and pierre understood
that this mysterious force completely controlled these men and that it
was now useless to say any more

the officer prisoners were separated from the soldiers and told to march
in front there were about thirty officers with pierre among them and
about three hundred men

the officers who had come from the other sheds were all strangers to
pierre and much better dressed than he they looked at him and at his
shoes mistrustfully as at an alien not far from him walked a fat major
with a sallow bloated angry face who was wearing a kazan dressing
gown tied round with a towel and who evidently enjoyed the respect of
his fellow prisoners he kept one hand in which he clasped his tobacco
pouch inside the bosom of his dressing gown and held the stem of his
pipe firmly with the other panting and puffing the major grumbled and
growled at everybody because he thought he was being pushed and that
they were all hurrying when they had nowhere to hurry to and were all
surprised at something when there was nothing to be surprised at
another a thin little officer was speaking to everyone conjecturing
where they were now being taken and how far they would get that day an
official in felt boots and wearing a commissariat uniform ran round from
side to side and gazed at the ruins of moscow loudly announcing his
observations as to what had been burned down and what this or that part
of the city was that they could see a third officer who by his accent
was a pole disputed with the commissariat officer arguing that he was
mistaken in his identification of the different wards of moscow

what are you disputing about said the major angrily what does it
matter whether it is st nicholas or st blasius you see its burned
down and theres an end of it what are you pushing for isnt the
road wide enough said he turning to a man behind him who was not
pushing him at all

oh oh oh what have they done the prisoners on one side and another
were heard saying as they gazed on the charred ruins all beyond the
river and zúbova and in the kremlin just look theres not half of
it left yes i told youthe whole quarter beyond the river and so it
is

well you know its burned so whats the use of talking said the
major

as they passed near a church in the khamovniki one of the few unburned
quarters of moscow the whole mass of prisoners suddenly started to one
side and exclamations of horror and disgust were heard

ah the villains what heathens yes dead dead so he is and
smeared with something

pierre too drew near the church where the thing was that evoked these
exclamations and dimly made out something leaning against the palings
surrounding the church from the words of his comrades who saw better
than he did he found that this was the body of a man set upright
against the palings with its face smeared with soot

go on what the devil go on thirty thousand devils the convoy
guards began cursing and the french soldiers with fresh virulence
drove away with their swords the crowd of prisoners who were gazing at
the dead man





chapter xiv

through the cross streets of the khamovniki quarter the prisoners
marched followed only by their escort and the vehicles and wagons
belonging to that escort but when they reached the supply stores they
came among a huge and closely packed train of artillery mingled with
private vehicles

at the bridge they all halted waiting for those in front to get across
from the bridge they had a view of endless lines of moving baggage
trains before and behind them to the right where the kaluga road turns
near neskuchny endless rows of troops and carts stretched away into the
distance these were troops of beauharnais corps which had started
before any of the others behind along the riverside and across the
stone bridge were neys troops and transport

davouts troops in whose charge were the prisoners were crossing the
crimean bridge and some were already debouching into the kaluga road
but the baggage trains stretched out so that the last of beauharnais
train had not yet got out of moscow and reached the kaluga road when the
vanguard of neys army was already emerging from the great ordynka
street

when they had crossed the crimean bridge the prisoners moved a few steps
forward halted and again moved on and from all sides vehicles and men
crowded closer and closer together they advanced the few hundred paces
that separated the bridge from the kaluga road taking more than an hour
to do so and came out upon the square where the streets of the
transmoskva ward and the kaluga road converge and the prisoners jammed
close together had to stand for some hours at that crossway from all
sides like the roar of the sea were heard the rattle of wheels the
tramp of feet and incessant shouts of anger and abuse pierre stood
pressed against the wall of a charred house listening to that noise
which mingled in his imagination with the roll of the drums

to get a better view several officer prisoners climbed onto the wall of
the halfburned house against which pierre was leaning

what crowds just look at the crowds theyve loaded goods even on
the cannon look there those are furs they exclaimed just see what
the blackguards have looted there see what that one has behind in
the cart why those are settings taken from some icons by
heaven oh the rascals see how that fellow has loaded himself
up he can hardly walk good lord theyve even grabbed those
chaises see that fellow there sitting on the trunks heavens
theyre fighting

thats right hit him on the snouton his snout like this we shant
get away before evening look look there why that must be
napoleons own see what horses and the monograms with a crown its
like a portable house that fellows dropped his sack and doesnt see
it fighting again a woman with a baby and not badlooking either
yes i dare say thats the way theyll let you pass just look
theres no end to it russian wenches by heaven so they are in
carriagessee how comfortably theyve settled themselves

again as at the church in khamovniki a wave of general curiosity bore
all the prisoners forward onto the road and pierre thanks to his
stature saw over the heads of the others what so attracted their
curiosity in three carriages involved among the munition carts closely
squeezed together sat women with rouged faces dressed in glaring
colors who were shouting something in shrill voices

from the moment pierre had recognized the appearance of the mysterious
force nothing had seemed to him strange or dreadful neither the corpse
smeared with soot for fun nor these women hurrying away nor the burned
ruins of moscow all that he now witnessed scarcely made an impression
on himas if his soul making ready for a hard struggle refused to
receive impressions that might weaken it

the womens vehicles drove by behind them came more carts soldiers
wagons soldiers gun carriages carriages soldiers ammunition carts
more soldiers and now and then women

pierre did not see the people as individuals but saw their movement

all these people and horses seemed driven forward by some invisible
power during the hour pierre watched them they all came flowing from
the different streets with one and the same desire to get on quickly
they all jostled one another began to grow angry and to fight white
teeth gleamed brows frowned ever the same words of abuse flew from
side to side and all the faces bore the same swaggeringly resolute and
coldly cruel expression that had struck pierre that morning on the
corporals face when the drums were beating

it was not till nearly evening that the officer commanding the escort
collected his men and with shouts and quarrels forced his way in among
the baggage trains and the prisoners hemmed in on all sides emerged
onto the kaluga road

they marched very quickly without resting and halted only when the sun
began to set the baggage carts drew up close together and the men began
to prepare for their nights rest they all appeared angry and
dissatisfied for a long time oaths angry shouts and fighting could
be heard from all sides a carriage that followed the escort ran into
one of the carts and knocked a hole in it with its pole several
soldiers ran toward the cart from different sides some beat the
carriage horses on their heads turning them aside others fought among
themselves and pierre saw that one german was badly wounded on the head
by a sword

it seemed that all these men now that they had stopped amid fields in
the chill dusk of the autumn evening experienced one and the same
feeling of unpleasant awakening from the hurry and eagerness to push on
that had seized them at the start once at a standstill they all seemed
to understand that they did not yet know where they were going and that
much that was painful and difficult awaited them on this journey

during this halt the escort treated the prisoners even worse than they
had done at the start it was here that the prisoners for the first time
received horseflesh for their meat ration

from the officer down to the lowest soldier they showed what seemed like
personal spite against each of the prisoners in unexpected contrast to
their former friendly relations

this spite increased still more when on calling over the roll of
prisoners it was found that in the bustle of leaving moscow one russian
soldier who had pretended to suffer from colic had escaped pierre saw
a frenchman beat a russian soldier cruelly for straying too far from the
road and heard his friend the captain reprimand and threaten to court
martial a noncommissioned officer on account of the escape of the
russian to the noncommissioned officers excuse that the prisoner was
ill and could not walk the officer replied that the order was to shoot
those who lagged behind pierre felt that that fatal force which had
crushed him during the executions but which he had not felt during his
imprisonment now again controlled his existence it was terrible but
he felt that in proportion to the efforts of that fatal force to crush
him there grew and strengthened in his soul a power of life independent
of it

he ate his supper of buckwheat soup with horseflesh and chatted with his
comrades

neither pierre nor any of the others spoke of what they had seen in
moscow or of the roughness of their treatment by the french or of the
order to shoot them which had been announced to them as if in reaction
against the worsening of their position they were all particularly
animated and gay they spoke of personal reminiscences of amusing
scenes they had witnessed during the campaign and avoided all talk of
their present situation

the sun had set long since bright stars shone out here and there in the
sky a red glow as of a conflagration spread above the horizon from the
rising full moon and that vast red ball swayed strangely in the gray
haze it grew light the evening was ending but the night had not yet
come pierre got up and left his new companions crossing between the
campfires to the other side of the road where he had been told the
common soldier prisoners were stationed he wanted to talk to them on
the road he was stopped by a french sentinel who ordered him back

pierre turned back not to his companions by the campfire but to an
unharnessed cart where there was nobody tucking his legs under him and
dropping his head he sat down on the cold ground by the wheel of the
cart and remained motionless a long while sunk in thought suddenly he
burst out into a fit of his broad goodnatured laughter so loud that
men from various sides turned with surprise to see what this strange and
evidently solitary laughter could mean

hahaha laughed pierre and he said aloud to himself the soldier
did not let me pass they took me and shut me up they hold me captive
what me me my immortal soul hahaha hahaha and he laughed
till tears started to his eyes

a man got up and came to see what this queer big fellow was laughing at
all by himself pierre stopped laughing got up went farther away from
the inquisitive man and looked around him

the huge endless bivouac that had previously resounded with the
crackling of campfires and the voices of many men had grown quiet the
red campfires were growing paler and dying down high up in the light
sky hung the full moon forests and fields beyond the camp unseen
before were now visible in the distance and farther still beyond
those forests and fields the bright oscillating limitless distance
lured one to itself pierre glanced up at the sky and the twinkling
stars in its faraway depths and all that is me all that is within me
and it is all i thought pierre and they caught all that and put it
into a shed boarded up with planks he smiled and went and lay down to
sleep beside his companions





chapter xv

in the early days of october another envoy came to kutúzov with a letter
from napoleon proposing peace and falsely dated from moscow though
napoleon was already not far from kutúzov on the old kaluga road
kutúzov replied to this letter as he had done to the one formerly
brought by lauriston saying that there could be no question of peace

soon after that a report was received from dorokhovs guerrilla
detachment operating to the left of tarutino that troops of broussiers
division had been seen at forminsk and that being separated from the
rest of the french army they might easily be destroyed the soldiers and
officers again demanded action generals on the staff excited by the
memory of the easy victory at tarutino urged kutúzov to carry out
dorokhovs suggestion kutúzov did not consider any offensive necessary
the result was a compromise which was inevitable a small detachment was
sent to forminsk to attack broussier

by a strange coincidence this task which turned out to be a most
difficult and important one was entrusted to dokhturovthat same modest
little dokhturov whom no one had described to us as drawing up plans of
battles dashing about in front of regiments showering crosses on
batteries and so on and who was thought to be and was spoken of as
undecided and undiscerningbut whom we find commanding wherever the
position was most difficult all through the russofrench wars from
austerlitz to the year  at austerlitz he remained last at the
augezd dam rallying the regiments saving what was possible when all
were flying and perishing and not a single general was left in the rear
guard ill with fever he went to smolensk with twenty thousand men to
defend the town against napoleons whole army in smolensk at the
malakhov gate he had hardly dozed off in a paroxysm of fever before he
was awakened by the bombardment of the townand smolensk held out all
day long at the battle of borodino when bagration was killed and nine
tenths of the men of our left flank had fallen and the full force of the
french artillery fire was directed against it the man sent there was
this same irresolute and undiscerning dokhturovkutúzov hastening to
rectify a mistake he had made by sending someone else there first and
the quiet little dokhturov rode thither and borodino became the
greatest glory of the russian army many heroes have been described to
us in verse and prose but of dokhturov scarcely a word has been said

it was dokhturov again whom they sent to forminsk and from there to
maloyaroslavets the place where the last battle with the french was
fought and where the obvious disintegration of the french army began
and we are told of many geniuses and heroes of that period of the
campaign but of dokhturov nothing or very little is said and that
dubiously and this silence about dokhturov is the clearest testimony to
his merit

it is natural for a man who does not understand the workings of a
machine to imagine that a shaving that has fallen into it by chance and
is interfering with its action and tossing about in it is its most
important part the man who does not understand the construction of the
machine cannot conceive that the small connecting cogwheel which
revolves quietly is one of the most essential parts of the machine and
not the shaving which merely harms and hinders the working

on the tenth of october when dokhturov had gone halfway to forminsk and
stopped at the village of aristovo preparing faithfully to execute the
orders he had received the whole french army having in its convulsive
movement reached murats position apparently in order to give
battlesuddenly without any reason turned off to the left onto the new
kaluga road and began to enter forminsk where only broussier had been
till then at that time dokhturov had under his command besides
dorokhovs detachment the two small guerrilla detachments of figner and
seslavin

on the evening of october  seslavin came to the aristovo headquarters
with a french guardsman he had captured the prisoner said that the
troops that had entered forminsk that day were the vanguard of the whole
army that napoleon was there and the whole army had left moscow four
days previously that same evening a house serf who had come from
borovsk said he had seen an immense army entering the town some
cossacks of dokhturovs detachment reported having sighted the french
guards marching along the road to borovsk from all these reports it was
evident that where they had expected to meet a single division there was
now the whole french army marching from moscow in an unexpected
directionalong the kaluga road dokhturov was unwilling to undertake
any action as it was not clear to him now what he ought to do he had
been ordered to attack forminsk but only broussier had been there at
that time and now the whole french army was there ermolov wished to act
on his own judgment but dokhturov insisted that he must have kutúzovs
instructions so it was decided to send a dispatch to the staff

for this purpose a capable officer bolkhovitinov was chosen who was
to explain the whole affair by word of mouth besides delivering a
written report toward midnight bolkhovitinov having received the
dispatch and verbal instructions galloped off to the general staff
accompanied by a cossack with spare horses





chapter xvi

it was a warm dark autumn night it had been raining for four days
having changed horses twice and galloped twenty miles in an hour and a
half over a sticky muddy road bolkhovitinov reached litashevka after
one oclock at night dismounting at a cottage on whose wattle fence
hung a signboard general staff and throwing down his reins he entered
a dark passage

the general on duty quick its very important said he to someone
who had risen and was sniffing in the dark passage

he has been very unwell since the evening and this is the third night
he has not slept said the orderly pleadingly in a whisper you should
wake the captain first

but this is very important from general dokhturov said
bolkhovitinov entering the open door which he had found by feeling in
the dark

the orderly had gone in before him and began waking somebody

your honor your honor a courier

what whats that from whom came a sleepy voice

from dokhturov and from alexey petrovich napoleon is at forminsk
said bolkhovitinov unable to see in the dark who was speaking but
guessing by the voice that it was not konovnitsyn

the man who had wakened yawned and stretched himself

i dont like waking him he said fumbling for something he is very
ill perhaps this is only a rumor

here is the dispatch said bolkhovitinov my orders are to give it at
once to the general on duty

wait a moment ill light a candle you damned rascal where do you
always hide it said the voice of the man who was stretching himself
to the orderly this was shcherbinin konovnitsyns adjutant ive
found it ive found it he added

the orderly was striking a light and shcherbinin was fumbling for
something on the candlestick

oh the nasty beasts said he with disgust

by the light of the sparks bolkhovitinov saw shcherbinins youthful face
as he held the candle and the face of another man who was still asleep
this was konovnitsyn

when the flame of the sulphur splinters kindled by the tinder burned up
first blue and then red shcherbinin lit the tallow candle from the
candlestick of which the cockroaches that had been gnawing it were
running away and looked at the messenger bolkhovitinov was bespattered
all over with mud and had smeared his face by wiping it with his sleeve

who gave the report inquired shcherbinin taking the envelope

the news is reliable said bolkhovitinov prisoners cossacks and
the scouts all say the same thing

theres nothing to be done well have to wake him said shcherbinin
rising and going up to the man in the nightcap who lay covered by a
greatcoat peter petrovich said he konovnitsyn did not stir to
the general staff he said with a smile knowing that those words would
be sure to arouse him

and in fact the head in the nightcap was lifted at once on
konovnitsyns handsome resolute face with cheeks flushed by fever
there still remained for an instant a faraway dreamy expression remote
from present affairs but then he suddenly started and his face assumed
its habitual calm and firm appearance

well what is it from whom he asked immediately but without hurry
blinking at the light

while listening to the officers report konovnitsyn broke the seal and
read the dispatch hardly had he done so before he lowered his legs in
their woolen stockings to the earthen floor and began putting on his
boots then he took off his nightcap combed his hair over his temples
and donned his cap

did you get here quickly let us go to his highness

konovnitsyn had understood at once that the news brought was of great
importance and that no time must be lost he did not consider or ask
himself whether the news was good or bad that did not interest him he
regarded the whole business of the war not with his intelligence or his
reason but by something else there was within him a deep unexpressed
conviction that all would be well but that one must not trust to this
and still less speak about it but must only attend to ones own work
and he did his work giving his whole strength to the task

peter petrovich konovnitsyn like dokhturov seems to have been included
merely for proprietys sake in the list of the socalled heroes of
the barclays raevskis ermolovs platovs and miloradoviches like
dokhturov he had the reputation of being a man of very limited capacity
and information and like dokhturov he never made plans of battle but
was always found where the situation was most difficult since his
appointment as general on duty he had always slept with his door open
giving orders that every messenger should be allowed to wake him up in
battle he was always under fire so that kutúzov reproved him for it and
feared to send him to the front and like dokhturov he was one of those
unnoticed cogwheels that without clatter or noise constitute the most
essential part of the machine

coming out of the hut into the damp dark night konovnitsyn
frownedpartly from an increased pain in his head and partly at the
unpleasant thought that occurred to him of how all that nest of
influential men on the staff would be stirred up by this news
especially bennigsen who ever since tarutino had been at daggers drawn
with kutúzov and how they would make suggestions quarrel issue
orders and rescind them and this premonition was disagreeable to him
though he knew it could not be helped

and in fact toll to whom he went to communicate the news immediately
began to expound his plans to a general sharing his quarters until
konovnitsyn who listened in weary silence reminded him that they must
go to see his highness





chapter xvii

kutúzov like all old people did not sleep much at night he often fell
asleep unexpectedly in the daytime but at night lying on his bed
without undressing he generally remained awake thinking

so he lay now on his bed supporting his large heavy scarred head on
his plump hand with his one eye open meditating and peering into the
darkness

since bennigsen who corresponded with the emperor and had more
influence than anyone else on the staff had begun to avoid him kutúzov
was more at ease as to the possibility of himself and his troops being
obliged to take part in useless aggressive movements the lesson of the
tarutino battle and of the day before it which kutúzov remembered with
pain must he thought have some effect on others too

they must understand that we can only lose by taking the offensive
patience and time are my warriors my champions thought kutúzov he
knew that an apple should not be plucked while it is green it will fall
of itself when ripe but if picked unripe the apple is spoiled the tree
is harmed and your teeth are set on edge like an experienced sportsman
he knew that the beast was wounded and wounded as only the whole
strength of russia could have wounded it but whether it was mortally
wounded or not was still an undecided question now by the fact of
lauriston and barthelemi having been sent and by the reports of the
guerrillas kutúzov was almost sure that the wound was mortal but he
needed further proofs and it was necessary to wait

they want to run to see how they have wounded it wait and we shall
see continual maneuvers continual advances thought he what for
only to distinguish themselves as if fighting were fun they are like
children from whom one cant get any sensible account of what has
happened because they all want to show how well they can fight but
thats not what is needed now

and what ingenious maneuvers they all propose to me it seems to them
that when they have thought of two or three contingencies he
remembered the general plan sent him from petersburg they have
foreseen everything but the contingencies are endless

the undecided question as to whether the wound inflicted at borodino was
mortal or not had hung over kutúzovs head for a whole month on the one
hand the french had occupied moscow on the other kutúzov felt assured
with all his being that the terrible blow into which he and all the
russians had put their whole strength must have been mortal but in any
case proofs were needed he had waited a whole month for them and grew
more impatient the longer he waited lying on his bed during those
sleepless nights he did just what he reproached those younger generals
for doing he imagined all sorts of possible contingencies just like
the younger men but with this difference that he saw thousands of
contingencies instead of two or three and based nothing on them the
longer he thought the more contingencies presented themselves he
imagined all sorts of movements of the napoleonic army as a whole or in
sectionsagainst petersburg or against him or to outflank him he
thought too of the possibility which he feared most of all that
napoleon might fight him with his own weapon and remain in moscow
awaiting him kutúzov even imagined that napoleons army might turn back
through medyn and yukhnov but the one thing he could not foresee was
what happenedthe insane convulsive stampede of napoleons army during
its first eleven days after leaving moscow a stampede which made
possible what kutúzov had not yet even dared to think ofthe complete
extermination of the french dorokhovs report about broussiers
division the guerrillas reports of distress in napoleons army rumors
of preparations for leaving moscow all confirmed the supposition that
the french army was beaten and preparing for flight but these were only
suppositions which seemed important to the younger men but not to
kutúzov with his sixty years experience he knew what value to attach
to rumors knew how apt people who desire anything are to group all news
so that it appears to confirm what they desire and he knew how readily
in such cases they omit all that makes for the contrary and the more he
desired it the less he allowed himself to believe it this question
absorbed all his mental powers all else was to him only lifes
customary routine to such customary routine belonged his conversations
with the staff the letters he wrote from tarutino to madame de stael
the reading of novels the distribution of awards his correspondence
with petersburg and so on but the destruction of the french which he
alone foresaw was his hearts one desire

on the night of the eleventh of october he lay leaning on his arm and
thinking of that

there was a stir in the next room and he heard the steps of toll
konovnitsyn and bolkhovitinov

eh whos there come in come in what news the field marshal called
out to them

while a footman was lighting a candle toll communicated the substance
of the news

who brought it asked kutúzov with a look which when the candle was
lit struck toll by its cold severity

there can be no doubt about it your highness

call him in call him here

kutúzov sat up with one leg hanging down from the bed and his big paunch
resting against the other which was doubled under him he screwed up his
seeing eye to scrutinize the messenger more carefully as if wishing to
read in his face what preoccupied his own mind

tell me tell me friend said he to bolkhovitinov in his low aged
voice as he pulled together the shirt which gaped open on his chest
come nearernearer what news have you brought me eh that napoleon
has left moscow are you sure eh

bolkhovitinov gave a detailed account from the beginning of all he had
been told to report

speak quicker quicker dont torture me kutúzov interrupted him

bolkhovitinov told him everything and was then silent awaiting
instructions toll was beginning to say something but kutúzov checked
him he tried to say something but his face suddenly puckered and
wrinkled he waved his arm at toll and turned to the opposite side of
the room to the corner darkened by the icons that hung there

o lord my creator thou has heard our prayer said he in a
tremulous voice with folded hands russia is saved i thank thee o
lord and he wept





chapter xviii

from the time he received this news to the end of the campaign all
kutúzovs activity was directed toward restraining his troops by
authority by guile and by entreaty from useless attacks maneuvers
or encounters with the perishing enemy dokhturov went to malo
yaroslavets but kutúzov lingered with the main army and gave orders for
the evacuation of kalugaa retreat beyond which town seemed to him quite
possible

everywhere kutúzov retreated but the enemy without waiting for his
retreat fled in the opposite direction

napoleons historians describe to us his skilled maneuvers at tarutino
and maloyaroslavets and make conjectures as to what would have
happened had napoleon been in time to penetrate into the rich southern
provinces

but not to speak of the fact that nothing prevented him from advancing
into those southern provinces for the russian army did not bar his
way the historians forget that nothing could have saved his army for
then already it bore within itself the germs of inevitable ruin how
could that armywhich had found abundant supplies in moscow and had
trampled them underfoot instead of keeping them and on arriving at
smolensk had looted provisions instead of storing themhow could that
army recuperate in kaluga province which was inhabited by russians such
as those who lived in moscow and where fire had the same property of
consuming what was set ablaze

that army could not recover anywhere since the battle of borodino and
the pillage of moscow it had borne within itself as it were the
chemical elements of dissolution

the members of what had once been an armynapoleon himself and all his
soldiers fledwithout knowing whither each concerned only to make his
escape as quickly as possible from this position of the hopelessness of
which they were all more or less vaguely conscious

so it came about that at the council at maloyaroslavets when the
generals pretending to confer together expressed various opinions all
mouths were closed by the opinion uttered by the simpleminded soldier
mouton who speaking last said what they all felt that the one thing
needful was to get away as quickly as possible and no one not even
napoleon could say anything against that truth which they all
recognized

but though they all realized that it was necessary to get away there
still remained a feeling of shame at admitting that they must flee an
external shock was needed to overcome that shame and this shock came in
due time it was what the french called le hourra de lempereur

the day after the council at maloyaroslavets napoleon rode out early in
the morning amid the lines of his army with his suite of marshals and an
escort on the pretext of inspecting the army and the scene of the
previous and of the impending battle some cossacks on the prowl for
booty fell in with the emperor and very nearly captured him if the
cossacks did not capture napoleon then what saved him was the very
thing that was destroying the french army the booty on which the
cossacks fell here as at tarutino they went after plunder leaving the
men disregarding napoleon they rushed after the plunder and napoleon
managed to escape

when les enfants du don might so easily have taken the emperor himself
in the midst of his army it was clear that there was nothing for it but
to fly as fast as possible along the nearest familiar road napoleon
with his fortyyearold stomach understood that hint not feeling his
former agility and boldness and under the influence of the fright the
cossacks had given him he at once agreed with mouton and issued
ordersas the historians tell usto retreat by the smolensk road

that napoleon agreed with mouton and that the army retreated does not
prove that napoleon caused it to retreat but that the forces which
influenced the whole army and directed it along the mozhaysk that is
the smolensk road acted simultaneously on him also





chapter xix

a man in motion always devises an aim for that motion to be able to go
a thousand miles he must imagine that something good awaits him at the
end of those thousand miles one must have the prospect of a promised
land to have the strength to move

the promised land for the french during their advance had been moscow
during their retreat it was their native land but that native land was
too far off and for a man going a thousand miles it is absolutely
necessary to set aside his final goal and to say to himself today i
shall get to a place twentyfive miles off where i shall rest and spend
the night and during the first days journey that resting place
eclipses his ultimate goal and attracts all his hopes and desires and
the impulses felt by a single person are always magnified in a crowd

for the french retreating along the old smolensk road the final
goaltheir native landwas too remote and their immediate goal was
smolensk toward which all their desires and hopes enormously
intensified in the mass urged them on it was not that they knew that
much food and fresh troops awaited them in smolensk nor that they were
told so on the contrary their superior officers and napoleon himself
knew that provisions were scarce there but because this alone could
give them strength to move on and endure their present privations so
both those who knew and those who did not know deceived themselves and
pushed on to smolensk as to a promised land

coming out onto the highroad the french fled with surprising energy and
unheardof rapidity toward the goal they had fixed on besides the
common impulse which bound the whole crowd of french into one mass and
supplied them with a certain energy there was another cause binding
them togethertheir great numbers as with the physical law of gravity
their enormous mass drew the individual human atoms to itself in their
hundreds of thousands they moved like a whole nation

each of them desired nothing more than to give himself up as a prisoner
to escape from all this horror and misery but on the one hand the force
of this common attraction to smolensk their goal drew each of them in
the same direction on the other hand an army corps could not surrender
to a company and though the french availed themselves of every
convenient opportunity to detach themselves and to surrender on the
slightest decent pretext such pretexts did not always occur their very
numbers and their crowded and swift movement deprived them of that
possibility and rendered it not only difficult but impossible for the
russians to stop this movement to which the french were directing all
their energies beyond a certain limit no mechanical disruption of the
body could hasten the process of decomposition

a lump of snow cannot be melted instantaneously there is a certain
limit of time in less than which no amount of heat can melt the snow on
the contrary the greater the heat the more solidified the remaining snow
becomes

of the russian commanders kutúzov alone understood this when the flight
of the french army along the smolensk road became well defined what
konovnitsyn had foreseen on the night of the eleventh of october began
to occur the superior officers all wanted to distinguish themselves to
cut off to seize to capture and to overthrow the french and all
clamored for action

kutúzov alone used all his power and such power is very limited in the
case of any commanderinchief to prevent an attack

he could not tell them what we say now why fight why block the road
losing our own men and inhumanly slaughtering unfortunate wretches what
is the use of that when a third of their army has melted away on the
road from moscow to vyazma without any battle but drawing from his
aged wisdom what they could understand he told them of the golden
bridge and they laughed at and slandered him flinging themselves on
rending and exulting over the dying beast

ermolov miloradovich platov and others in proximity to the french
near vyazma could not resist their desire to cut off and break up two
french corps and by way of reporting their intention to kutúzov they
sent him a blank sheet of paper in an envelope

and try as kutúzov might to restrain the troops our men attacked
trying to bar the road infantry regiments we are told advanced to the
attack with music and with drums beating and killed and lost thousands
of men

but they did not cut off or overthrow anybody and the french army
closing up more firmly at the danger continued while steadily melting
away to pursue its fatal path to smolensk





book fourteen





chapter i

the battle of borodino with the occupation of moscow that followed it
and the flight of the french without further conflicts is one of the
most instructive phenomena in history

all historians agree that the external activity of states and nations in
their conflicts with one another is expressed in wars and that as a
direct result of greater or less success in war the political strength
of states and nations increases or decreases

strange as may be the historical account of how some king or emperor
having quarreled with another collects an army fights his enemys
army gains a victory by killing three five or ten thousand men and
subjugates a kingdom and an entire nation of several millions all the
facts of history as far as we know it confirm the truth of the
statement that the greater or lesser success of one army against another
is the cause or at least an essential indication of an increase or
decrease in the strength of the nationeven though it is unintelligible
why the defeat of an armya hundredth part of a nationshould oblige
that whole nation to submit an army gains a victory and at once the
rights of the conquering nation have increased to the detriment of the
defeated an army has suffered defeat and at once a people loses its
rights in proportion to the severity of the reverse and if its army
suffers a complete defeat the nation is quite subjugated

so according to history it has been found from the most ancient times
and so it is to our own day all napoleons wars serve to confirm this
rule in proportion to the defeat of the austrian army austria loses its
rights and the rights and the strength of france increase the
victories of the french at jena and auerstadt destroy the independent
existence of prussia

but then in  the french gain a victory near moscow moscow is
taken and after that with no further battles it is not russia that
ceases to exist but the french army of six hundred thousand and then
napoleonic france itself to strain the facts to fit the rules of
history to say that the field of battle at borodino remained in the
hands of the russians or that after moscow there were other battles
that destroyed napoleons army is impossible

after the french victory at borodino there was no general engagement nor
any that were at all serious yet the french army ceased to exist what
does this mean if it were an example taken from the history of china
we might say that it was not an historic phenomenon which is the
historians usual expedient when anything does not fit their standards
if the matter concerned some brief conflict in which only a small number
of troops took part we might treat it as an exception but this event
occurred before our fathers eyes and for them it was a question of the
life or death of their fatherland and it happened in the greatest of
all known wars

the period of the campaign of  from the battle of borodino to the
expulsion of the french proved that the winning of a battle does not
produce a conquest and is not even an invariable indication of conquest
it proved that the force which decides the fate of peoples lies not in
the conquerors nor even in armies and battles but in something else

the french historians describing the condition of the french army
before it left moscow affirm that all was in order in the grand army
except the cavalry the artillery and the transportthere was no forage
for the horses or the cattle that was a misfortune no one could remedy
for the peasants of the district burned their hay rather than let the
french have it

the victory gained did not bring the usual results because the peasants
karp and vlas who after the french had evacuated moscow drove in their
carts to pillage the town and in general personally failed to manifest
any heroic feelings and the whole innumerable multitude of such
peasants did not bring their hay to moscow for the high price offered
them but burned it instead

let us imagine two men who have come out to fight a duel with rapiers
according to all the rules of the art of fencing the fencing has gone
on for some time suddenly one of the combatants feeling himself
wounded and understanding that the matter is no joke but concerns his
life throws down his rapier and seizing the first cudgel that comes to
hand begins to brandish it then let us imagine that the combatant who
so sensibly employed the best and simplest means to attain his end was
at the same time influenced by traditions of chivalry and desiring to
conceal the facts of the case insisted that he had gained his victory
with the rapier according to all the rules of art one can imagine what
confusion and obscurity would result from such an account of the duel

the fencer who demanded a contest according to the rules of fencing was
the french army his opponent who threw away the rapier and snatched up
the cudgel was the russian people those who try to explain the matter
according to the rules of fencing are the historians who have described
the event

after the burning of smolensk a war began which did not follow any
previous traditions of war the burning of towns and villages the
retreats after battles the blow dealt at borodino and the renewed
retreat the burning of moscow the capture of marauders the seizure of
transports and the guerrilla war were all departures from the rules

napoleon felt this and from the time he took up the correct fencing
attitude in moscow and instead of his opponents rapier saw a cudgel
raised above his head he did not cease to complain to kutúzov and to
the emperor alexander that the war was being carried on contrary to all
the rulesas if there were any rules for killing people in spite of the
complaints of the french as to the nonobservance of the rules in spite
of the fact that to some highly placed russians it seemed rather
disgraceful to fight with a cudgel and they wanted to assume a pose en
quarte or en tierce according to all the rules and to make an adroit
thrust en prime and so onthe cudgel of the peoples war was lifted
with all its menacing and majestic strength and without consulting
anyones tastes or rules and regardless of anything else it rose and
fell with stupid simplicity but consistently and belabored the french
till the whole invasion had perished

and it is well for a people who do notas the french did in salute
according to all the rules of art and presenting the hilt of their
rapier gracefully and politely hand it to their magnanimous conqueror
but at the moment of trial without asking what rules others have
adopted in similar cases simply and easily pick up the first cudgel
that comes to hand and strike with it till the feeling of resentment and
revenge in their soul yields to a feeling of contempt and compassion





chapter ii

one of the most obvious and advantageous departures from the socalled
laws of war is the action of scattered groups against men pressed
together in a mass such action always occurs in wars that take on a
national character in such actions instead of two crowds opposing each
other the men disperse attack singly run away when attacked by
stronger forces but again attack when opportunity offers this was done
by the guerrillas in spain by the mountain tribes in the caucasus and
by the russians in

people have called this kind of war guerrilla warfare and assume that
by so calling it they have explained its meaning but such a war does
not fit in under any rule and is directly opposed to a wellknown rule
of tactics which is accepted as infallible that rule says that an
attacker should concentrate his forces in order to be stronger than his
opponent at the moment of conflict

guerrilla war always successful as history shows directly infringes
that rule

this contradiction arises from the fact that military science assumes
the strength of an army to be identical with its numbers military
science says that the more troops the greater the strength les gros
bataillons ont toujours raison

 large battalions are always victorious

for military science to say this is like defining momentum in mechanics
by reference to the mass only stating that momenta are equal or unequal
to each other simply because the masses involved are equal or unequal

momentum quantity of motion is the product of mass and velocity

in military affairs the strength of an army is the product of its mass
and some unknown x

military science seeing in history innumerable instances of the fact
that the size of any army does not coincide with its strength and that
small detachments defeat larger ones obscurely admits the existence of
this unknown factor and tries to discover itnow in a geometric
formation now in the equipment employed now and most usually in the
genius of the commanders but the assignment of these various meanings
to the factor does not yield results which accord with the historic
facts

yet it is only necessary to abandon the false view adopted to gratify
the heroes of the efficacy of the directions issued in wartime by
commanders in order to find this unknown quantity

that unknown quantity is the spirit of the army that is to say the
greater or lesser readiness to fight and face danger felt by all the men
composing an army quite independently of whether they are or are not
fighting under the command of a genius in twoor threeline formation
with cudgels or with rifles that repeat thirty times a minute men who
want to fight will always put themselves in the most advantageous
conditions for fighting

the spirit of an army is the factor which multiplied by the mass gives
the resulting force to define and express the significance of this
unknown factorthe spirit of an armyis a problem for science

this problem is only solvable if we cease arbitrarily to substitute for
the unknown x itself the conditions under which that force becomes
apparentsuch as the commands of the general the equipment employed
and so onmistaking these for the real significance of the factor and
if we recognize this unknown quantity in its entirety as being the
greater or lesser desire to fight and to face danger only then
expressing known historic facts by equations and comparing the relative
significance of this factor can we hope to define the unknown

ten men battalions or divisions fighting fifteen men battalions or
divisions conquerthat is kill or take captiveall the others while
themselves losing four so that on the one side four and on the other
fifteen were lost consequently the four were equal to the fifteen and
therefore x  y consequently xy   this equation does not give
us the value of the unknown factor but gives us a ratio between two
unknowns and by bringing variously selected historic units battles
campaigns periods of war into such equations a series of numbers
could be obtained in which certain laws should exist and might be
discovered

the tactical rule that an army should act in masses when attacking and
in smaller groups in retreat unconsciously confirms the truth that the
strength of an army depends on its spirit to lead men forward under
fire more discipline obtainable only by movement in masses is needed
than is needed to resist attacks but this rule which leaves out of
account the spirit of the army continually proves incorrect and is in
particularly striking contrast to the facts when some strong rise or
fall in the spirit of the troops occurs as in all national wars

the french retreating in though according to tactics they should
have separated into detachments to defend themselvescongregated into a
mass because the spirit of the army had so fallen that only the mass
held the army together the russians on the contrary ought according
to tactics to have attacked in mass but in fact they split up into
small units because their spirit had so risen that separate
individuals without orders dealt blows at the french without needing
any compulsion to induce them to expose themselves to hardships and
dangers





chapter iii

the socalled partisan war began with the entry of the french into
smolensk

before partisan warfare had been officially recognized by the
government thousands of enemy stragglers marauders and foragers had
been destroyed by the cossacks and the peasants who killed them off as
instinctively as dogs worry a stray mad dog to death denis davydov
with his russian instinct was the first to recognize the value of this
terrible cudgel which regardless of the rules of military science
destroyed the french and to him belongs the credit for taking the first
step toward regularizing this method of warfare

on august  davydovs first partisan detachment was formed and then
others were recognized the further the campaign progressed the more
numerous these detachments became

the irregulars destroyed the great army piecemeal they gathered the
fallen leaves that dropped of themselves from that withered treethe
french armyand sometimes shook that tree itself by october when the
french were fleeing toward smolensk there were hundreds of such
companies of various sizes and characters there were some that adopted
all the army methods and had infantry artillery staffs and the
comforts of life others consisted solely of cossack cavalry there were
also small scratch groups of foot and horse and groups of peasants and
landowners that remained unknown a sacristan commanded one party which
captured several hundred prisoners in the course of a month and there
was vasílisa the wife of a village elder who slew hundreds of the
french

the partisan warfare flamed up most fiercely in the latter days of
october its first period had passed when the partisans themselves
amazed at their own boldness feared every minute to be surrounded and
captured by the french and hid in the forests without unsaddling
hardly daring to dismount and always expecting to be pursued by the end
of october this kind of warfare had taken definite shape it had become
clear to all what could be ventured against the french and what could
not now only the commanders of detachments with staffs and moving
according to rules at a distance from the french still regarded many
things as impossible the small bands that had started their activities
long before and had already observed the french closely considered
things possible which the commanders of the big detachments did not dare
to contemplate the cossacks and peasants who crept in among the french
now considered everything possible

on october  denisov who was one of the irregulars was with his
group at the height of the guerrilla enthusiasm since early morning he
and his party had been on the move all day long he had been watching
from the forest that skirted the highroad a large french convoy of
cavalry baggage and russian prisoners separated from the rest of the
army whichas was learned from spies and prisonerswas moving under a
strong escort to smolensk besides denisov and dólokhov who also led a
small party and moved in denisovs vicinity the commanders of some
large divisions with staffs also knew of this convoy and as denisov
expressed it were sharpening their teeth for it two of the commanders
of large partiesone a pole and the other a germansent invitations to
denisov almost simultaneously requesting him to join up with their
divisions to attack the convoy

no bwother i have gwown mustaches myself said denisov on reading
these documents and he wrote to the german that despite his heartfelt
desire to serve under so valiant and renowned a general he had to forgo
that pleasure because he was already under the command of the polish
general to the polish general he replied to the same effect informing
him that he was already under the command of the german

having arranged matters thus denisov and dólokhov intended without
reporting matters to the higher command to attack and seize that convoy
with their own small forces on october  it was moving from the
village of mikulino to that of shamshevo to the left of the road
between mikulino and shamshevo there were large forests extending in
some places up to the road itself though in others a mile or more back
from it through these forests denisov and his party rode all day
sometimes keeping well back in them and sometimes coming to the very
edge but never losing sight of the moving french that morning
cossacks of denisovs party had seized and carried off into the forest
two wagons loaded with cavalry saddles which had stuck in the mud not
far from mikulino where the forest ran close to the road since then
and until evening the party had watched the movements of the french
without attacking it was necessary to let the french reach shamshevo
quietly without alarming them and then after joining dólokhov who was
to come that evening to a consultation at a watchmans hut in the forest
less than a mile from shamshevo to surprise the french at dawn falling
like an avalanche on their heads from two sides and rout and capture
them all at one blow

in their rear more than a mile from mikulino where the forest came
right up to the road six cossacks were posted to report if any fresh
columns of french should show themselves

beyond shamshevo dólokhov was to observe the road in the same way to
find out at what distance there were other french troops they reckoned
that the convoy had fifteen hundred men denisov had two hundred and
dólokhov might have as many more but the disparity of numbers did not
deter denisov all that he now wanted to know was what troops these were
and to learn that he had to capture a tonguethat is a man from the
enemy column that mornings attack on the wagons had been made so
hastily that the frenchmen with the wagons had all been killed only a
little drummer boy had been taken alive and as he was a straggler he
could tell them nothing definite about the troops in that column

denisov considered it dangerous to make a second attack for fear of
putting the whole column on the alert so he sent tíkhon shcherbaty a
peasant of his party to shamshevo to try and seize at least one of the
french quartermasters who had been sent on in advance





chapter iv

it was a warm rainy autumn day the sky and the horizon were both the
color of muddy water at times a sort of mist descended and then
suddenly heavy slanting rain came down

denisov in a felt cloak and a sheepskin cap from which the rain ran down
was riding a thin thoroughbred horse with sunken sides like his horse
which turned its head and laid its ears back he shrank from the driving
rain and gazed anxiously before him his thin face with its short thick
black beard looked angry

beside denisov rode an esaul  denisovs fellow worker also in felt
cloak and sheepskin cap and riding a large sleek don horse

 a captain of cossacks

esaul lovayski the third was a tall man as straight as an arrow pale
faced fairhaired with narrow light eyes and with calm self
satisfaction in his face and bearing though it was impossible to say in
what the peculiarity of the horse and rider lay yet at first glance at
the esaul and denisov one saw that the latter was wet and uncomfortable
and was a man mounted on a horse while looking at the esaul one saw
that he was as comfortable and as much at ease as always and that he was
not a man who had mounted a horse but a man who was one with his horse
a being consequently possessed of twofold strength

a little ahead of them walked a peasant guide wet to the skin and
wearing a gray peasant coat and a white knitted cap

a little behind on a poor small lean kirghiz mount with an enormous
tail and mane and a bleeding mouth rode a young officer in a blue
french overcoat

beside him rode an hussar with a boy in a tattered french uniform and
blue cap behind him on the crupper of his horse the boy held on to the
hussar with cold red hands and raising his eyebrows gazed about him
with surprise this was the french drummer boy captured that morning

behind them along the narrow sodden cutup forest road came hussars in
threes and fours and then cossacks some in felt cloaks some in french
greatcoats and some with horsecloths over their heads the horses
being drenched by the rain all looked black whether chestnut or bay
their necks with their wet closeclinging manes looked strangely
thin steam rose from them clothes saddles reins were all wet
slippery and sodden like the ground and the fallen leaves that strewed
the road the men sat huddled up trying not to stir so as to warm the
water that had trickled to their bodies and not admit the fresh cold
water that was leaking in under their seats their knees and at the
back of their necks in the midst of the outspread line of cossacks two
wagons drawn by french horses and by saddled cossack horses that had
been hitched on in front rumbled over the tree stumps and branches and
splashed through the water that lay in the ruts

denisovs horse swerved aside to avoid a pool in the track and bumped
his riders knee against a tree

oh the devil exclaimed denisov angrily and showing his teeth he
struck his horse three times with his whip splashing himself and his
comrades with mud

denisov was out of sorts both because of the rain and also from hunger
none of them had eaten anything since morning and yet more because he
still had no news from dólokhov and the man sent to capture a tongue
had not returned

therell hardly be another such chance to fall on a transport as today
its too risky to attack them by oneself and if we put it off till
another day one of the big guerrilla detachments will snatch the prey
from under our noses thought denisov continually peering forward
hoping to see a messenger from dólokhov

on coming to a path in the forest along which he could see far to the
right denisov stopped

theres someone coming said he

the esaul looked in the direction denisov indicated

there are two an officer and a cossack but it is not presupposable
that it is the lieutenant colonel himself said the esaul who was fond
of using words the cossacks did not know

the approaching riders having descended a decline were no longer
visible but they reappeared a few minutes later in front at a weary
gallop and using his leather whip rode an officer disheveled and
drenched whose trousers had worked up to above his knees behind him
standing in the stirrups trotted a cossack the officer a very young
lad with a broad rosy face and keen merry eyes galloped up to denisov
and handed him a sodden envelope

from the general said the officer please excuse its not being quite
dry

denisov frowning took the envelope and opened it

there they kept telling us its dangerous its dangerous said
the officer addressing the esaul while denisov was reading the
dispatch but komarov and ihe pointed to the cossackwere prepared
we have each of us two pistols but whats this he asked noticing
the french drummer boy a prisoner youve already been in action may
i speak to him

wostov pétya exclaimed denisov having run through the dispatch
why didnt you say who you were and turning with a smile he held out
his hand to the lad

the officer was pétya rostóv

all the way pétya had been preparing himself to behave with denisov as
befitted a grownup man and an officerwithout hinting at their previous
acquaintance but as soon as denisov smiled at him pétya brightened up
blushed with pleasure forgot the official manner he had been
rehearsing and began telling him how he had already been in a battle
near vyazma and how a certain hussar had distinguished himself there

well i am glad to see you denisov interrupted him and his face
again assumed its anxious expression

michael feoklitych said he to the esaul this is again fwom that
german you know hehe indicated pétyais serving under him

and denisov told the esaul that the dispatch just delivered was a
repetition of the german generals demand that he should join forces
with him for an attack on the transport

if we dont take it tomowwow hell snatch it fwom under our noses he
added

while denisov was talking to the esaul pétyaabashed by denisovs cold
tone and supposing that it was due to the condition of his
trousersfurtively tried to pull them down under his greatcoat so that
no one should notice it while maintaining as martial an air as
possible

will there be any orders your honor he asked denisov holding his
hand at the salute and resuming the game of adjutant and general for
which he had prepared himself or shall i remain with your honor

orders denisov repeated thoughtfully but can you stay till
tomowwow

oh please may i stay with you cried pétya

but just what did the genewal tell you to weturn at once asked
denisov

pétya blushed

he gave me no instructions i think i could he returned inquiringly

well all wight said denisov

and turning to his men he directed a party to go on to the halting place
arranged near the watchmans hut in the forest and told the officer on
the kirghiz horse who performed the duties of an adjutant to go and
find out where dólokhov was and whether he would come that evening
denisov himself intended going with the esaul and pétya to the edge of
the forest where it reached out to shamshevo to have a look at the part
of the french bivouac they were to attack next day

well old fellow said he to the peasant guide lead us to
shamshevo

denisov pétya and the esaul accompanied by some cossacks and the
hussar who had the prisoner rode to the left across a ravine to the
edge of the forest





chapter v

the rain had stopped and only the mist was falling and drops from the
trees denisov the esaul and pétya rode silently following the
peasant in the knitted cap who stepping lightly with outturned toes and
moving noiselessly in his bast shoes over the roots and wet leaves
silently led them to the edge of the forest

he ascended an incline stopped looked about him and advanced to where
the screen of trees was less dense on reaching a large oak tree that
had not yet shed its leaves he stopped and beckoned mysteriously to
them with his hand

denisov and pétya rode up to him from the spot where the peasant was
standing they could see the french immediately beyond the forest on a
downward slope lay a field of spring rye to the right beyond a steep
ravine was a small village and a landowners house with a broken roof
in the village in the house in the garden by the well by the pond
over all the rising ground and all along the road uphill from the
bridge leading to the village not more than five hundred yards away
crowds of men could be seen through the shimmering mist their un
russian shouting at their horses which were straining uphill with the
carts and their calls to one another could be clearly heard

bwing the prisoner here said denisov in a low voice not taking his
eyes off the french

a cossack dismounted lifted the boy down and took him to denisov
pointing to the french troops denisov asked him what these and those of
them were the boy thrusting his cold hands into his pockets and
lifting his eyebrows looked at denisov in affright but in spite of an
evident desire to say all he knew gave confused answers merely
assenting to everything denisov asked him denisov turned away from him
frowning and addressed the esaul conveying his own conjectures to him

pétya rapidly turning his head looked now at the drummer boy now at
denisov now at the esaul and now at the french in the village and
along the road trying not to miss anything of importance

whether dólokhov comes or not we must seize it eh said denisov with
a merry sparkle in his eyes

it is a very suitable spot said the esaul

well send the infantwy down by the swamps denisov continued
theyll cweep up to the garden youll wide up fwom there with the
cossackshe pointed to a spot in the forest beyond the villageand i
with my hussars fwom here and at the signal shot

the hollow is impassabletheres a swamp there said the esaul the
horses would sink we must ride round more to the left

while they were talking in undertones the crack of a shot sounded from
the low ground by the pond a puff of white smoke appeared then
another and the sound of hundreds of seemingly merry french voices
shouting together came up from the slope for a moment denisov and the
esaul drew back they were so near that they thought they were the cause
of the firing and shouting but the firing and shouting did not relate
to them down below a man wearing something red was running through the
marsh the french were evidently firing and shouting at him

why thats our tíkhon said the esaul

so it is it is

the wascal said denisov

hell get away said the esaul screwing up his eyes

the man whom they called tíkhon having run to the stream plunged in so
that the water splashed in the air and having disappeared for an
instant scrambled out on all fours all black with the wet and ran on
the french who had been pursuing him stopped

smart that said the esaul

what a beast said denisov with his former look of vexation what has
he been doing all this time

who is he asked pétya

hes our plastun i sent him to capture a tongue

oh yes said pétya nodding at the first words denisov uttered as if
he understood it all though he really did not understand anything of
it

tíkhon shcherbaty was one of the most indispensable men in their band
he was a peasant from pokrovsk near the river gzhat when denisov had
come to pokrovsk at the beginning of his operations and had as usual
summoned the village elder and asked him what he knew about the french
the elder as though shielding himself had replied as all village
elders did that he had neither seen nor heard anything of them but
when denisov explained that his purpose was to kill the french and
asked if no french had strayed that way the elder replied that some
moreorderers had really been at their village but that tíkhon
shcherbaty was the only man who dealt with such matters denisov had
tíkhon called and having praised him for his activity said a few words
in the elders presence about loyalty to the tsar and the country and
the hatred of the french that all sons of the fatherland should cherish

we dont do the french any harm said tíkhon evidently frightened by
denisovs words we only fooled about with the lads for fun you know
we killed a score or so of moreorderers but we did no harm else

next day when denisov had left pokrovsk having quite forgotten about
this peasant it was reported to him that tíkhon had attached himself to
their party and asked to be allowed to remain with it denisov gave
orders to let him do so

tíkhon who at first did rough work laying campfires fetching water
flaying dead horses and so on soon showed a great liking and aptitude
for partisan warfare at night he would go out for booty and always
brought back french clothing and weapons and when told to would bring
in french captives also denisov then relieved him from drudgery and
began taking him with him when he went out on expeditions and had him
enrolled among the cossacks

tíkhon did not like riding and always went on foot never lagging
behind the cavalry he was armed with a musketoon which he carried
rather as a joke a pike and an ax which latter he used as a wolf uses
its teeth with equal ease picking fleas out of its fur or crunching
thick bones tíkhon with equal accuracy would split logs with blows at
arms length or holding the head of the ax would cut thin little pegs
or carve spoons in denisovs party he held a peculiar and exceptional
position when anything particularly difficult or nasty had to be
doneto push a cart out of the mud with ones shoulders pull a horse
out of a swamp by its tail skin it slink in among the french or walk
more than thirty miles in a dayeverybody pointed laughingly at tíkhon

it wont hurt that devilhes as strong as a horse they said of him

once a frenchman tíkhon was trying to capture fired a pistol at him and
shot him in the fleshy part of the back that wound which tíkhon
treated only with internal and external applications of vodka was the
subject of the liveliest jokes by the whole detachmentjokes in which
tíkhon readily joined

hallo mate never again gave you a twist the cossacks would banter
him and tíkhon purposely writhing and making faces pretended to be
angry and swore at the french with the funniest curses the only effect
of this incident on tíkhon was that after being wounded he seldom
brought in prisoners

he was the bravest and most useful man in the party no one found more
opportunities for attacking no one captured or killed more frenchmen
and consequently he was made the buffoon of all the cossacks and hussars
and willingly accepted that role now he had been sent by denisov
overnight to shamshevo to capture a tongue but whether because he had
not been content to take only one frenchman or because he had slept
through the night he had crept by day into some bushes right among the
french and as denisov had witnessed from above had been detected by
them





chapter vi

after talking for some time with the esaul about next days attack
which now seeing how near they were to the french he seemed to have
definitely decided on denisov turned his horse and rode back

now my lad well go and get dwy he said to pétya

as they approached the watchhouse denisov stopped peering into the
forest among the trees a man with long legs and long swinging arms
wearing a short jacket bast shoes and a kazan hat was approaching
with long light steps he had a musketoon over his shoulder and an ax
stuck in his girdle when he espied denisov he hastily threw something
into the bushes removed his sodden hat by its floppy brim and
approached his commander it was tíkhon his wrinkled and pockmarked
face and narrow little eyes beamed with selfsatisfied merriment he
lifted his head high and gazed at denisov as if repressing a laugh

well where did you disappear to inquired denisov

where did i disappear to i went to get frenchmen answered tíkhon
boldly and hurriedly in a husky but melodious bass voice

why did you push yourself in there by daylight you ass well why
havent you taken one

oh i took one all right said tíkhon

where is he

you see i took him first thing at dawn tíkhon continued spreading
out his flat feet with outturned toes in their bast shoes i took him
into the forest then i see hes no good and think ill go and fetch a
likelier one

you see what a wogueits just as i thought said denisov to the
esaul why didnt you bwing that one

what was the good of bringing him tíkhon interrupted hastily and
angrilythat one wouldnt have done for you as if i dont know what
sort you want

what a bwute you are well

i went for another one tíkhon continued and i crept like this
through the wood and lay down he suddenly lay down on his stomach
with a supple movement to show how he had done it one turned up and i
grabbed him like this he jumped up quickly and lightly come
along to the colonel i said he starts yelling and suddenly there
were four of them they rushed at me with their little swords so i went
for them with my ax this way what are you up to says i christ be
with you shouted tíkhon waving his arms with an angry scowl and
throwing out his chest

yes we saw from the hill how you took to your heels through the
puddles said the esaul screwing up his glittering eyes

pétya badly wanted to laugh but noticed that they all refrained from
laughing he turned his eyes rapidly from tíkhons face to the esauls
and denisovs unable to make out what it all meant

dont play the fool said denisov coughing angrily why didnt you
bwing the first one

tíkhon scratched his back with one hand and his head with the other
then suddenly his whole face expanded into a beaming foolish grin
disclosing a gap where he had lost a tooth that was why he was called
shcherbatythe gaptoothed denisov smiled and pétya burst into a peal
of merry laughter in which tíkhon himself joined

oh but he was a regular goodfornothing said tíkhon the clothes
on himpoor stuff how could i bring him and so rude your honor why
he says im a generals son myself i wont go he says

you are a bwute said denisov i wanted to question

but i questioned him said tíkhon he said he didnt know much
there are a lot of us he says but all poor stuffonly soldiers in
name he says shout loud at them he says and youll take them
all tíkhon concluded looking cheerfully and resolutely into
denisovs eyes

ill give you a hundwed sharp lashesthatll teach you to play the
fool said denisov severely

but why are you angry remonstrated tíkhon just as if id never seen
your frenchmen only wait till it gets dark and ill fetch you any of
them you wantthree if you like

well lets go said denisov and rode all the way to the watchhouse
in silence and frowning angrily

tíkhon followed behind and pétya heard the cossacks laughing with him
and at him about some pair of boots he had thrown into the bushes

when the fit of laughter that had seized him at tíkhons words and smile
had passed and pétya realized for a moment that this tíkhon had killed a
man he felt uneasy he looked round at the captive drummer boy and felt
a pang in his heart but this uneasiness lasted only a moment he felt
it necessary to hold his head higher to brace himself and to question
the esaul with an air of importance about tomorrows undertaking that
he might not be unworthy of the company in which he found himself

the officer who had been sent to inquire met denisov on the way with the
news that dólokhov was soon coming and that all was well with him

denisov at once cheered up and calling pétya to him said well tell
me about yourself





chapter vii

pétya having left his people after their departure from moscow joined
his regiment and was soon taken as orderly by a general commanding a
large guerrilla detachment from the time he received his commission
and especially since he had joined the active army and taken part in the
battle of vyazma pétya had been in a constant state of blissful
excitement at being grownup and in a perpetual ecstatic hurry not to
miss any chance to do something really heroic he was highly delighted
with what he saw and experienced in the army but at the same time it
always seemed to him that the really heroic exploits were being
performed just where he did not happen to be and he was always in a
hurry to get where he was not

when on the twentyfirst of october his general expressed a wish to send
somebody to denisovs detachment pétya begged so piteously to be sent
that the general could not refuse but when dispatching him he recalled
pétyas mad action at the battle of vyazma where instead of riding by
the road to the place to which he had been sent he had galloped to the
advanced line under the fire of the french and had there twice fired his
pistol so now the general explicitly forbade his taking part in any
action whatever of denisovs that was why pétya had blushed and grown
confused when denisov asked him whether he could stay before they had
ridden to the outskirts of the forest pétya had considered he must carry
out his instructions strictly and return at once but when he saw the
french and saw tíkhon and learned that there would certainly be an
attack that night he decided with the rapidity with which young people
change their views that the general whom he had greatly respected till
then was a rubbishy german that denisov was a hero the esaul a hero
and tíkhon a hero too and that it would be shameful for him to leave
them at a moment of difficulty

it was already growing dusk when denisov pétya and the esaul rode up
to the watchhouse in the twilight saddled horses could be seen and
cossacks and hussars who had rigged up rough shelters in the glade and
were kindling glowing fires in a hollow of the forest where the french
could not see the smoke in the passage of the small watchhouse a
cossack with sleeves rolled up was chopping some mutton in the room
three officers of denisovs band were converting a door into a tabletop
pétya took off his wet clothes gave them to be dried and at once began
helping the officers to fix up the dinner table

in ten minutes the table was ready and a napkin spread on it on the
table were vodka a flask of rum white bread roast mutton and salt

sitting at table with the officers and tearing the fat savory mutton
with his hands down which the grease trickled pétya was in an ecstatic
childish state of love for all men and consequently of confidence that
others loved him in the same way

so then what do you think vasíli dmítrich said he to denisov its
all right my staying a day with you and not waiting for a reply he
answered his own question you see i was told to find outwell i am
finding out only do let me into the very into the chief i
dont want a reward but i want

pétya clenched his teeth and looked around throwing back his head and
flourishing his arms

into the vewy chief denisov repeated with a smile

only please let me command something so that i may really command
pétya went on what would it be to you oh you want a knife he
said turning to an officer who wished to cut himself a piece of mutton

and he handed him his clasp knife the officer admired it

please keep it i have several like it said pétya blushing
heavens i was quite forgetting he suddenly cried i have some
raisins fine ones you know seedless ones we have a new sutler and he
has such capital things i bought ten pounds i am used to something
sweet would you like some and pétya ran out into the passage to
his cossack and brought back some bags which contained about five pounds
of raisins have some gentlemen have some

you want a coffeepot dont you he asked the esaul i bought a
capital one from our sutler he has splendid things and hes very
honest thats the chief thing ill be sure to send it to you or
perhaps your flints are giving out or are worn outthat happens
sometimes you know i have brought some with me here they areand he
showed a baga hundred flints i bought them very cheap please take as
many as you want or all if you like

then suddenly dismayed lest he had said too much pétya stopped and
blushed

he tried to remember whether he had not done anything else that was
foolish and running over the events of the day he remembered the french
drummer boy its capital for us here but what of him where have they
put him have they fed him havent they hurt his feelings he thought
but having caught himself saying too much about the flints he was now
afraid to speak out

i might ask he thought but theyll say hes a boy himself and so
he pities the boy ill show them tomorrow whether im a boy will it
seem odd if i ask pétya thought well never mind and immediately
blushing and looking anxiously at the officers to see if they appeared
ironical he said

may i call in that boy who was taken prisoner and give him something to
eat perhaps

yes hes a poor little fellow said denisov who evidently saw
nothing shameful in this reminder call him in his name is vincent
bosse have him fetched

ill call him said pétya

yes yes call him a poor little fellow denisov repeated

pétya was standing at the door when denisov said this he slipped in
between the officers came close to denisov and said

let me kiss you dear old fellow oh how fine how splendid

and having kissed denisov he ran out of the hut

bosse vincent pétya cried stopping outside the door

who do you want sir asked a voice in the darkness

pétya replied that he wanted the french lad who had been captured that
day

ah vesenny said a cossack

vincent the boys name had already been changed by the cossacks into
vesenny vernal and into vesenya by the peasants and soldiers in both
these adaptations the reference to spring vesna matched the impression
made by the young lad

he is warming himself there by the bonfire ho vesenya
vesenyavesenny laughing voices were heard calling to one another in
the darkness

hes a smart lad said an hussar standing near pétya we gave him
something to eat a while ago he was awfully hungry

the sound of bare feet splashing through the mud was heard in the
darkness and the drummer boy came to the door

ah cest vous said pétya voulezvous manger nayez pas peur on
ne vous fera pas de mal  he added shyly and affectionately touching
the boys hand entrez entrez

 ah its you do you want something to eat dont be afraid they
wont hurt you

  come in come in

merci monsieur  said the drummer boy in a trembling almost childish
voice and he began scraping his dirty feet on the threshold

 thank you sir

there were many things pétya wanted to say to the drummer boy but did
not dare to he stood irresolutely beside him in the passage then in
the darkness he took the boys hand and pressed it

come in come in he repeated in a gentle whisper oh what can i do
for him he thought and opening the door he let the boy pass in first

when the boy had entered the hut pétya sat down at a distance from him
considering it beneath his dignity to pay attention to him but he
fingered the money in his pocket and wondered whether it would seem
ridiculous to give some to the drummer boy





chapter viii

the arrival of dólokhov diverted pétyas attention from the drummer boy
to whom denisov had had some mutton and vodka given and whom he had had
dressed in a russian coat so that he might be kept with their band and
not sent away with the other prisoners pétya had heard in the army many
stories of dólokhovs extraordinary bravery and of his cruelty to the
french so from the moment he entered the hut pétya did not take his
eyes from him but braced himself up more and more and held his head
high that he might not be unworthy even of such company

dólokhovs appearance amazed pétya by its simplicity

denisov wore a cossack coat had a beard had an icon of nicholas the
wonderworker on his breast and his way of speaking and everything he
did indicated his unusual position but dólokhov who in moscow had worn
a persian costume had now the appearance of a most correct officer of
the guards he was cleanshaven and wore a guardsmans padded coat with
an order of st george at his buttonhole and a plain forage cap set
straight on his head he took off his wet felt cloak in a corner of the
room and without greeting anyone went up to denisov and began
questioning him about the matter in hand denisov told him of the
designs the large detachments had on the transport of the message pétya
had brought and his own replies to both generals then he told him all
he knew of the french detachment

thats so but we must know what troops they are and their numbers
said dólokhov it will be necessary to go there we cant start the
affair without knowing for certain how many there are i like to work
accurately here nowwouldnt one of these gentlemen like to ride over
to the french camp with me i have brought a spare uniform

i i ill go with you cried pétya

theres no need for you to go at all said denisov addressing
dólokhov and as for him i wont let him go on any account

i like that exclaimed pétya why shouldnt i go

because its useless

well you must excuse me because because i shall go and thats
all youll take me wont you he said turning to dólokhov

why not dólokhov answered absently scrutinizing the face of the
french drummer boy have you had that youngster with you long he
asked denisov

he was taken today but he knows nothing im keeping him with me

yes and where do you put the others inquired dólokhov

where i send them away and take a weceipt for them shouted denisov
suddenly flushing and i say boldly that i have not a single mans life
on my conscience would it be difficult for you to send thirty or thwee
hundwed men to town under escort instead of stainingi speak
bluntlystaining the honor of a soldier

that kind of amiable talk would be suitable from this young count of
sixteen said dólokhov with cold irony but its time for you to drop
it

why ive not said anything i only say that ill certainly go with
you said pétya shyly

but for you and me old fellow its time to drop these amenities
continued dólokhov as if he found particular pleasure in speaking of
this subject which irritated denisov now why have you kept this lad
he went on swaying his head because you are sorry for him dont we
know those receipts of yours you send a hundred men away and thirty
get there the rest either starve or get killed so isnt it all the
same not to send them

the esaul screwing up his lightcolored eyes nodded approvingly

thats not the point im not going to discuss the matter i do not
wish to take it on my conscience you say theyll die all wight only
not by my fault

dólokhov began laughing

who has told them not to capture me these twenty times over but if
they did catch me theyd string me up to an aspen tree and with all
your chivalry just the same he paused however we must get to work
tell the cossack to fetch my kit i have two french uniforms in it
well are you coming with me he asked pétya

i yes yes certainly cried pétya blushing almost to tears and
glancing at denisov

while dólokhov had been disputing with denisov what should be done with
prisoners pétya had once more felt awkward and restless but again he
had no time to grasp fully what they were talking about if grownup
distinguished men think so it must be necessary and right thought he
but above all denisov must not dare to imagine that ill obey him and
that he can order me about i will certainly go to the french camp with
dólokhov if he can so can i

and to all denisovs persuasions pétya replied that he too was
accustomed to do everything accurately and not just anyhow and that he
never considered personal danger

for youll admit that if we dont know for sure how many of them there
are hundreds of lives may depend on it while there are only two of
us besides i want to go very much and certainly will go so dont
hinder me said he it will only make things worse





chapter ix

having put on french greatcoats and shakos pétya and dólokhov rode to
the clearing from which denisov had reconnoitered the french camp and
emerging from the forest in pitch darkness they descended into the
hollow on reaching the bottom dólokhov told the cossacks accompanying
him to await him there and rode on at a quick trot along the road to the
bridge pétya his heart in his mouth with excitement rode by his side

if were caught i wont be taken alive i have a pistol whispered
he

dont talk russian said dólokhov in a hurried whisper and at that
very moment they heard through the darkness the challenge qui vive
and the click of a musket

 who goes there

the blood rushed to pétyas face and he grasped his pistol

lanciers du me  replied dólokhov neither hastening nor slackening
his horses pace

 lancers of the th regiment

the black figure of a sentinel stood on the bridge

mot dordre

 password

dólokhov reined in his horse and advanced at a walk

dites donc le colonel gerard est ici  he asked

 tell me is colonel gerard here

mot dordre repeated the sentinel barring the way and not replying

quand un officier fait sa ronde les sentinelles ne demandent pas le
mot dordre cried dólokhov suddenly flaring up and riding straight
at the sentinel je vous demande si le colonel est ici

 when an officer is making his round sentinels dont ask him for the
password i am asking you if the colonel is here

and without waiting for an answer from the sentinel who had stepped
aside dólokhov rode up the incline at a walk

noticing the black outline of a man crossing the road dólokhov stopped
him and inquired where the commander and officers were the man a
soldier with a sack over his shoulder stopped came close up to
dólokhovs horse touched it with his hand and explained simply and in
a friendly way that the commander and the officers were higher up the
hill to the right in the courtyard of the farm as he called the
landowners house

having ridden up the road on both sides of which french talk could be
heard around the campfires dólokhov turned into the courtyard of the
landowners house having ridden in he dismounted and approached a big
blazing campfire around which sat several men talking noisily
something was boiling in a small cauldron at the edge of the fire and a
soldier in a peaked cap and blue overcoat lit up by the fire was
kneeling beside it stirring its contents with a ramrod

oh hes a hard nut to crack said one of the officers who was sitting
in the shadow at the other side of the fire

hell make them get a move on those fellows said another laughing

both fell silent peering out through the darkness at the sound of
dólokhovs and pétyas steps as they advanced to the fire leading their
horses

bonjour messieurs  said dólokhov loudly and clearly

 good day gentlemen

there was a stir among the officers in the shadow beyond the fire and
one tall longnecked officer walking round the fire came up to
dólokhov

is that you clement he asked where the devil but noticing
his mistake he broke off short and with a frown greeted dólokhov as a
stranger asking what he could do for him

dólokhov said that he and his companion were trying to overtake their
regiment and addressing the company in general asked whether they knew
anything of the th regiment none of them knew anything and pétya
thought the officers were beginning to look at him and dólokhov with
hostility and suspicion for some seconds all were silent

if you were counting on the evening soup you have come too late said
a voice from behind the fire with a repressed laugh

dólokhov replied that they were not hungry and must push on farther that
night

he handed the horses over to the soldier who was stirring the pot and
squatted down on his heels by the fire beside the officer with the long
neck that officer did not take his eyes from dólokhov and again asked
to what regiment he belonged dólokhov as if he had not heard the
question did not reply but lighting a short french pipe which he took
from his pocket began asking the officer in how far the road before them
was safe from cossacks

those brigands are everywhere replied an officer from behind the
fire

dólokhov remarked that the cossacks were a danger only to stragglers
such as his companion and himself but probably they would not dare to
attack large detachments he added inquiringly no one replied

well now hell come away pétya thought every moment as he stood by
the campfire listening to the talk

but dólokhov restarted the conversation which had dropped and began
putting direct questions as to how many men there were in the battalion
how many battalions and how many prisoners asking about the russian
prisoners with that detachment dólokhov said

a horrid business dragging these corpses about with one it would be
better to shoot such rabble and burst into loud laughter so strange
that pétya thought the french would immediately detect their disguise
and involuntarily took a step back from the campfire

no one replied a word to dólokhovs laughter and a french officer whom
they could not see he lay wrapped in a greatcoat rose and whispered
something to a companion dólokhov got up and called to the soldier who
was holding their horses

will they bring our horses or not thought pétya instinctively
drawing nearer to dólokhov

the horses were brought

good evening gentlemen said dólokhov

pétya wished to say good night but could not utter a word the
officers were whispering together dólokhov was a long time mounting his
horse which would not stand still then he rode out of the yard at a
footpace pétya rode beside him longing to look round to see whether or
not the french were running after them but not daring to

coming out onto the road dólokhov did not ride back across the open
country but through the village at one spot he stopped and listened
do you hear he asked pétya recognized the sound of russian voices
and saw the dark figures of russian prisoners round their campfires
when they had descended to the bridge pétya and dólokhov rode past the
sentinel who without saying a word paced morosely up and down it then
they descended into the hollow where the cossacks awaited them

well now goodby tell denisov at the first shot at daybreak said
dólokhov and was about to ride away but pétya seized hold of him

really he cried you are such a hero oh how fine how splendid
how i love you

all right all right said dólokhov but pétya did not let go of him
and dólokhov saw through the gloom that pétya was bending toward him and
wanted to kiss him dólokhov kissed him laughed turned his horse and
vanished into the darkness





chapter x

having returned to the watchmans hut pétya found denisov in the
passage he was awaiting pétyas return in a state of agitation
anxiety and selfreproach for having let him go

thank god he exclaimed yes thank god he repeated listening to
pétyas rapturous account but devil take you i havent slept because
of you well thank god now lie down we can still get a nap before
morning

but no said pétya i dont want to sleep yet besides i know
myself if i fall asleep its finished and then i am used to not
sleeping before a battle

he sat awhile in the hut joyfully recalling the details of his
expedition and vividly picturing to himself what would happen next day

then noticing that denisov was asleep he rose and went out of doors

it was still quite dark outside the rain was over but drops were still
falling from the trees near the watchmans hut the black shapes of the
cossacks shanties and of horses tethered together could be seen behind
the hut the dark shapes of the two wagons with their horses beside them
were discernible and in the hollow the dying campfire gleamed red not
all the cossacks and hussars were asleep here and there amid the
sounds of falling drops and the munching of the horses near by could be
heard low voices which seemed to be whispering

pétya came out peered into the darkness and went up to the wagons
someone was snoring under them and around them stood saddled horses
munching their oats in the dark pétya recognized his own horse which
he called karabakh though it was of ukranian breed and went up to it

well karabakh well do some service tomorrow said he sniffing its
nostrils and kissing it

why arent you asleep sir said a cossack who was sitting under a
wagon

no ah likhachevisnt that your name do you know i have only just
come back weve been into the french camp

and pétya gave the cossack a detailed account not only of his ride but
also of his object and why he considered it better to risk his life
than to act just anyhow

well you should get some sleep now said the cossack

no i am used to this said pétya i say arent the flints in your
pistols worn out i brought some with me dont you want any you can
have some

the cossack bent forward from under the wagon to get a closer look at
pétya

because i am accustomed to doing everything accurately said pétya
some fellows do things just anyhow without preparation and then
theyre sorry for it afterwards i dont like that

just so said the cossack

oh yes another thing please my dear fellow will you sharpen my
saber for me its got bl pétya feared to tell a lie and the saber
never had been sharpened can you do it

of course i can

likhachev got up rummaged in his pack and soon pétya heard the warlike
sound of steel on whetstone he climbed onto the wagon and sat on its
edge the cossack was sharpening the saber under the wagon

i say are the lads asleep asked pétya

some are and some arentlike us

well and that boy

vesenny oh hes thrown himself down there in the passage fast asleep
after his fright he was that glad

after that pétya remained silent for a long time listening to the
sounds he heard footsteps in the darkness and a black figure appeared

what are you sharpening asked a man coming up to the wagon

why this gentlemans saber

thats right said the man whom pétya took to be an hussar was the
cup left here

there by the wheel

the hussar took the cup

it must be daylight soon said he yawning and went away

pétya ought to have known that he was in a forest with denisovs
guerrilla band less than a mile from the road sitting on a wagon
captured from the french beside which horses were tethered that under
it likhachev was sitting sharpening a saber for him that the big dark
blotch to the right was the watchmans hut and the red blotch below to
the left was the dying embers of a campfire that the man who had come
for the cup was an hussar who wanted a drink but he neither knew nor
waited to know anything of all this he was in a fairy kingdom where
nothing resembled reality the big dark blotch might really be the
watchmans hut or it might be a cavern leading to the very depths of the
earth perhaps the red spot was a fire or it might be the eye of an
enormous monster perhaps he was really sitting on a wagon but it might
very well be that he was not sitting on a wagon but on a terribly high
tower from which if he fell he would have to fall for a whole day or a
whole month or go on falling and never reach the bottom perhaps it was
just the cossack likhachev who was sitting under the wagon but it
might be the kindest bravest most wonderful most splendid man in the
world whom no one knew of it might really have been that the hussar
came for water and went back into the hollow but perhaps he had simply
vanisheddisappeared altogether and dissolved into nothingness

nothing pétya could have seen now would have surprised him he was in a
fairy kingdom where everything was possible

he looked up at the sky and the sky was a fairy realm like the earth
it was clearing and over the tops of the trees clouds were swiftly
sailing as if unveiling the stars sometimes it looked as if the clouds
were passing and a clear black sky appeared sometimes it seemed as if
the black spaces were clouds sometimes the sky seemed to be rising
high high overhead and then it seemed to sink so low that one could
touch it with ones hand

pétyas eyes began to close and he swayed a little

the trees were dripping quiet talking was heard the horses neighed and
jostled one another someone snored

ozhegzheg ozhegzheg hissed the saber against the whetstone and
suddenly pétya heard an harmonious orchestra playing some unknown
sweetly solemn hymn pétya was as musical as natásha and more so than
nicholas but had never learned music or thought about it and so the
melody that unexpectedly came to his mind seemed to him particularly
fresh and attractive the music became more and more audible the melody
grew and passed from one instrument to another and what was played was
a fuguethough pétya had not the least conception of what a fugue is
each instrumentnow resembling a violin and now a horn but better and
clearer than violin or hornplayed its own part and before it had
finished the melody merged with another instrument that began almost the
same air and then with a third and a fourth and they all blended into
one and again became separate and again blended now into solemn church
music now into something dazzlingly brilliant and triumphant

ohwhy that was in a dream pétya said to himself as he lurched
forward its in my ears but perhaps its music of my own well go
on my music now

he closed his eyes and from all sides as if from a distance sounds
fluttered grew into harmonies separated blended and again all
mingled into the same sweet and solemn hymn oh this is delightful as
much as i like and as i like said pétya to himself he tried to
conduct that enormous orchestra

now softly softly die away and the sounds obeyed him now fuller
more joyful still more and more joyful and from an unknown depth rose
increasingly triumphant sounds now voices join in ordered pétya and
at first from afar he heard mens voices and then womens the voices
grew in harmonious triumphant strength and pétya listened to their
surpassing beauty in awe and joy

with a solemn triumphal march there mingled a song the drip from the
trees and the hissing of the saber ozhegzhegzheg and again the
horses jostled one another and neighed not disturbing the choir but
joining in it

pétya did not know how long this lasted he enjoyed himself all the
time wondered at his enjoyment and regretted that there was no one to
share it he was awakened by likhachevs kindly voice

its ready your honor you can split a frenchman in half with it

pétya woke up

its getting light its really getting light he exclaimed

the horses that had previously been invisible could now be seen to their
very tails and a watery light showed itself through the bare branches
pétya shook himself jumped up took a ruble from his pocket and gave it
to likhachev then he flourished the saber tested it and sheathed it
the cossacks were untying their horses and tightening their saddle
girths

and heres the commander said likhachev

denisov came out of the watchmans hut and having called pétya gave
orders to get ready





chapter xi

the men rapidly picked out their horses in the semidarkness tightened
their saddle girths and formed companies denisov stood by the
watchmans hut giving final orders the infantry of the detachment
passed along the road and quickly disappeared amid the trees in the mist
of early dawn hundreds of feet splashing through the mud the esaul
gave some orders to his men pétya held his horse by the bridle
impatiently awaiting the order to mount his face having been bathed in
cold water was all aglow and his eyes were particularly brilliant
cold shivers ran down his spine and his whole body pulsed rhythmically

well is evwything weady asked denisov bwing the horses

the horses were brought denisov was angry with the cossack because the
saddle girths were too slack reproved him and mounted pétya put his
foot in the stirrup his horse by habit made as if to nip his leg but
pétya leaped quickly into the saddle unconscious of his own weight and
turning to look at the hussars starting in the darkness behind him rode
up to denisov

vasíli dmítrich entrust me with some commission please for gods
sake said he

denisov seemed to have forgotten pétyas very existence he turned to
glance at him

i ask one thing of you he said sternly to obey me and not shove
yourself forward anywhere

he did not say another word to pétya but rode in silence all the way
when they had come to the edge of the forest it was noticeably growing
light over the field denisov talked in whispers with the esaul and the
cossacks rode past pétya and denisov when they had all ridden by
denisov touched his horse and rode down the hill slipping onto their
haunches and sliding the horses descended with their riders into the
ravine pétya rode beside denisov the pulsation of his body constantly
increasing it was getting lighter and lighter but the mist still hid
distant objects having reached the valley denisov looked back and
nodded to a cossack beside him

the signal said he

the cossack raised his arm and a shot rang out in an instant the tramp
of horses galloping forward was heard shouts came from various sides
and then more shots

at the first sound of trampling hoofs and shouting pétya lashed his
horse and loosening his rein galloped forward not heeding denisov who
shouted at him it seemed to pétya that at the moment the shot was fired
it suddenly became as bright as noon he galloped to the bridge
cossacks were galloping along the road in front of him on the bridge he
collided with a cossack who had fallen behind but he galloped on in
front of him soldiers probably frenchmen were running from right to
left across the road one of them fell in the mud under his horses
feet

cossacks were crowding about a hut busy with something from the midst
of that crowd terrible screams arose pétya galloped up and the first
thing he saw was the pale face and trembling jaw of a frenchman
clutching the handle of a lance that had been aimed at him

hurrah lads ours shouted pétya and giving rein to his
excited horse he galloped forward along the village street

he could hear shooting ahead of him cossacks hussars and ragged
russian prisoners who had come running from both sides of the road
were shouting something loudly and incoherently a gallantlooking
frenchman in a blue overcoat capless and with a frowning red face
had been defending himself against the hussars when pétya galloped up
the frenchman had already fallen too late again flashed through
pétyas mind and he galloped on to the place from which the rapid firing
could be heard the shots came from the yard of the landowners house he
had visited the night before with dólokhov the french were making a
stand there behind a wattle fence in a garden thickly overgrown with
bushes and were firing at the cossacks who crowded at the gateway
through the smoke as he approached the gate pétya saw dólokhov whose
face was of a palegreenish tint shouting to his men go round wait
for the infantry he exclaimed as pétya rode up to him

wait hurrahahah shouted pétya and without pausing a moment
galloped to the place whence came the sounds of firing and where the
smoke was thickest

a volley was heard and some bullets whistled past while others plashed
against something the cossacks and dólokhov galloped after pétya into
the gateway of the courtyard in the dense wavering smoke some of the
french threw down their arms and ran out of the bushes to meet the
cossacks while others ran down the hill toward the pond pétya was
galloping along the courtyard but instead of holding the reins he waved
both his arms about rapidly and strangely slipping farther and farther
to one side in his saddle his horse having galloped up to a campfire
that was smoldering in the morning light stopped suddenly and pétya
fell heavily on to the wet ground the cossacks saw that his arms and
legs jerked rapidly though his head was quite motionless a bullet had
pierced his skull

after speaking to the senior french officer who came out of the house
with a white handkerchief tied to his sword and announced that they
surrendered dólokhov dismounted and went up to pétya who lay
motionless with outstretched arms

done for he said with a frown and went to the gate to meet denisov
who was riding toward him

killed cried denisov recognizing from a distance the unmistakably
lifeless attitudevery familiar to himin which pétyas body was lying

done for repeated dólokhov as if the utterance of these words
afforded him pleasure and he went quickly up to the prisoners who were
surrounded by cossacks who had hurried up we wont take them he
called out to denisov

denisov did not reply he rode up to pétya dismounted and with
trembling hands turned toward himself the bloodstained mudbespattered
face which had already gone white

i am used to something sweet raisins fine ones take them all he
recalled pétyas words and the cossacks looked round in surprise at the
sound like the yelp of a dog with which denisov turned away walked to
the wattle fence and seized hold of it

among the russian prisoners rescued by denisov and dólokhov was pierre
bezúkhov





chapter xii

during the whole of their march from moscow no fresh orders had been
issued by the french authorities concerning the party of prisoners among
whom was pierre on the twentysecond of october that party was no
longer with the same troops and baggage trains with which it had left
moscow half the wagons laden with hardtack that had traveled the first
stages with them had been captured by cossacks the other half had gone
on ahead not one of those dismounted cavalrymen who had marched in
front of the prisoners was left they had all disappeared the artillery
the prisoners had seen in front of them during the first days was now
replaced by marshal junots enormous baggage train convoyed by
westphalians behind the prisoners came a cavalry baggage train

from vyazma onwards the french army which had till then moved in three
columns went on as a single group the symptoms of disorder that pierre
had noticed at their first halting place after leaving moscow had now
reached the utmost limit

the road along which they moved was bordered on both sides by dead
horses ragged men who had fallen behind from various regiments
continually changed about now joining the moving column now again
lagging behind it

several times during the march false alarms had been given and the
soldiers of the escort had raised their muskets fired and run
headlong crushing one another but had afterwards reassembled and
abused each other for their causeless panic

these three groups traveling togetherthe cavalry stores the convoy of
prisoners and junots baggage trainstill constituted a separate and
united whole though each of the groups was rapidly melting away

of the artillery baggage train which had consisted of a hundred and
twenty wagons not more than sixty now remained the rest had been
captured or left behind some of junots wagons also had been captured
or abandoned three wagons had been raided and robbed by stragglers from
davouts corps from the talk of the germans pierre learned that a
larger guard had been allotted to that baggage train than to the
prisoners and that one of their comrades a german soldier had been
shot by the marshals own order because a silver spoon belonging to the
marshal had been found in his possession

the group of prisoners had melted away most of all of the three hundred
and thirty men who had set out from moscow fewer than a hundred now
remained the prisoners were more burdensome to the escort than even the
cavalry saddles or junots baggage they understood that the saddles and
junots spoon might be of some use but that cold and hungry soldiers
should have to stand and guard equally cold and hungry russians who
froze and lagged behind on the road in which case the order was to
shoot them was not merely incomprehensible but revolting and the
escort as if afraid in the grievous condition they themselves were in
of giving way to the pity they felt for the prisoners and so rendering
their own plight still worse treated them with particular moroseness
and severity

at dorogobuzh while the soldiers of the convoy after locking the
prisoners in a stable had gone off to pillage their own stores several
of the soldier prisoners tunneled under the wall and ran away but were
recaptured by the french and shot

the arrangement adopted when they started that the officer prisoners
should be kept separate from the rest had long since been abandoned
all who could walk went together and after the third stage pierre had
rejoined karataev and the grayblue bandylegged dog that had chosen
karataev for its master

on the third day after leaving moscow karataev again fell ill with the
fever he had suffered from in the hospital in moscow and as he grew
gradually weaker pierre kept away from him pierre did not know why but
since karataev had begun to grow weaker it had cost him an effort to go
near him when he did so and heard the subdued moaning with which
karataev generally lay down at the halting places and when he smelled
the odor emanating from him which was now stronger than before pierre
moved farther away and did not think about him

while imprisoned in the shed pierre had learned not with his intellect
but with his whole being by life itself that man is created for
happiness that happiness is within him in the satisfaction of simple
human needs and that all unhappiness arises not from privation but from
superfluity and now during these last three weeks of the march he had
learned still another new consolatory truththat nothing in this world
is terrible he had learned that as there is no condition in which man
can be happy and entirely free so there is no condition in which he
need be unhappy and lack freedom he learned that suffering and freedom
have their limits and that those limits are very near together that the
person in a bed of roses with one crumpled petal suffered as keenly as
he now sleeping on the bare damp earth with one side growing chilled
while the other was warming and that when he had put on tight dancing
shoes he had suffered just as he did now when he walked with bare feet
that were covered with soreshis footgear having long since fallen to
pieces he discovered that when he had married his wifeof his own free
will as it had seemed to himhe had been no more free than now when they
locked him up at night in a stable of all that he himself subsequently
termed his sufferings but which at the time he scarcely felt the worst
was the state of his bare raw and scabcovered feet the horseflesh
was appetizing and nourishing the saltpeter flavor of the gunpowder
they used instead of salt was even pleasant there was no great cold it
was always warm walking in the daytime and at night there were the
campfires the lice that devoured him warmed his body the one thing
that was at first hard to bear was his feet

after the second days march pierre having examined his feet by the
campfire thought it would be impossible to walk on them but when
everybody got up he went along limping and when he had warmed up
walked without feeling the pain though at night his feet were more
terrible to look at than before however he did not look at them now
but thought of other things

only now did pierre realize the full strength of life in man and the
saving power he has of transferring his attention from one thing to
another which is like the safety valve of a boiler that allows
superfluous steam to blow off when the pressure exceeds a certain limit

he did not see and did not hear how they shot the prisoners who lagged
behind though more than a hundred perished in that way he did not
think of karataev who grew weaker every day and evidently would soon
have to share that fate still less did pierre think about himself the
harder his position became and the more terrible the future the more
independent of that position in which he found himself were the joyful
and comforting thoughts memories and imaginings that came to him





chapter xiii

at midday on the twentysecond of october pierre was going uphill along
the muddy slippery road looking at his feet and at the roughness of
the way occasionally he glanced at the familiar crowd around him and
then again at his feet the former and the latter were alike familiar
and his own the bluegray bandy legged dog ran merrily along the side
of the road sometimes in proof of its agility and selfsatisfaction
lifting one hind leg and hopping along on three and then again going on
all four and rushing to bark at the crows that sat on the carrion the
dog was merrier and sleeker than it had been in moscow all around lay
the flesh of different animalsfrom men to horsesin various stages of
decomposition and as the wolves were kept off by the passing men the
dog could eat all it wanted

it had been raining since morning and had seemed as if at any moment it
might cease and the sky clear but after a short break it began raining
harder than before the saturated road no longer absorbed the water
which ran along the ruts in streams

pierre walked along looking from side to side counting his steps in
threes and reckoning them off on his fingers mentally addressing the
rain he repeated now then now then go on pelt harder

it seemed to him that he was thinking of nothing but far down and deep
within him his soul was occupied with something important and
comforting this something was a most subtle spiritual deduction from a
conversation with karataev the day before

at their yesterdays halting place feeling chilly by a dying campfire
pierre had got up and gone to the next one which was burning better
there platon karataev was sitting covered uphead and allwith his
greatcoat as if it were a vestment telling the soldiers in his
effective and pleasant though now feeble voice a story pierre knew it
was already past midnight the hour when karataev was usually free of
his fever and particularly lively when pierre reached the fire and
heard platons voice enfeebled by illness and saw his pathetic face
brightly lit up by the blaze he felt a painful prick at his heart his
feeling of pity for this man frightened him and he wished to go away
but there was no other fire and pierre sat down trying not to look at
platon

well how are you he asked

how am i if we grumble at sickness god wont grant us death replied
platon and at once resumed the story he had begun

and so brother he continued with a smile on his pale emaciated face
and a particularly happy light in his eyes you see brother

pierre had long been familiar with that story karataev had told it to
him alone some halfdozen times and always with a specially joyful
emotion but well as he knew it pierre now listened to that tale as to
something new and the quiet rapture karataev evidently felt as he told
it communicated itself also to pierre the story was of an old merchant
who lived a good and godfearing life with his family and who went once
to the nizhni fair with a companiona rich merchant

having put up at an inn they both went to sleep and next morning his
companion was found robbed and with his throat cut a bloodstained knife
was found under the old merchants pillow he was tried knouted and
his nostrils having been torn off all in due form as karataev put it
he was sent to hard labor in siberia

and so brother it was at this point that pierre came up ten years
or more passed by the old man was living as a convict submitting as he
should and doing no wrong only he prayed to god for death well one
night the convicts were gathered just as we are with the old man among
them and they began telling what each was suffering for and how they
had sinned against god one told how he had taken a life another had
taken two a third had set a house on fire while another had simply
been a vagrant and had done nothing so they asked the old man what
are you being punished for daddyi my dear brothers said he am
being punished for my own and other mens sins but i have not killed
anyone or taken anything that was not mine but have only helped my
poorer brothers i was a merchant my dear brothers and had much
property and he went on to tell them all about it in due order i
dont grieve for myself he says god it seems has chastened me
only i am sorry for my old wife and the children and the old man began
to weep now it happened that in the group was the very man who had
killed the other merchant where did it happen daddy he said when
and in what month he asked all about it and his heart began to ache
so he comes up to the old man like this and falls down at his feet
you are perishing because of me daddy he says its quite true
lads that this man he says is being tortured innocently and for
nothing i he says did that deed and i put the knife under your
head while you were asleep forgive me daddy he says for christs
sake

karataev paused smiling joyously as he gazed into the fire and he drew
the logs together

and the old man said god will forgive you we are all sinners in his
sight i suffer for my own sins and he wept bitter tears well and
what do you think dear friends karataev continued his face
brightening more and more with a rapturous smile as if what he now had
to tell contained the chief charm and the whole meaning of his story
what do you think dear fellows that murderer confessed to the
authorities i have taken six lives he says he was a great sinner
but what i am most sorry for is this old man dont let him suffer
because of me so he confessed and it was all written down and the
papers sent off in due form the place was a long way off and while
they were judging what with one thing and another filling in the
papers all in due formthe authorities i meantime passed the affair
reached the tsar after a while the tsars decree came to set the
merchant free and give him a compensation that had been awarded the
paper arrived and they began to look for the old man where is the old
man who has been suffering innocently and in vain a paper has come from
the tsar so they began looking for him here karataevs lower jaw
trembled but god had already forgiven himhe was dead thats how it
was dear fellows karataev concluded and sat for a long time silent
gazing before him with a smile

and pierres soul was dimly but joyfully filled not by the story itself
but by its mysterious significance by the rapturous joy that lit up
karataevs face as he told it and the mystic significance of that joy





chapter xiv

a vos places  suddenly cried a voice

 to your places

a pleasant feeling of excitement and an expectation of something joyful
and solemn was aroused among the soldiers of the convoy and the
prisoners from all sides came shouts of command and from the left came
smartly dressed cavalrymen on good horses passing the prisoners at a
trot the expression on all faces showed the tension people feel at the
approach of those in authority the prisoners thronged together and were
pushed off the road the convoy formed up

the emperor the emperor the marshal the duke and hardly had the
sleek cavalry passed before a carriage drawn by six gray horses rattled
by pierre caught a glimpse of a man in a threecornered hat with a
tranquil look on his handsome plump white face it was one of the
marshals his eye fell on pierres large and striking figure and in the
expression with which he frowned and looked away pierre thought he
detected sympathy and a desire to conceal that sympathy

the general in charge of the stores galloped after the carriage with a
red and frightened face whipping up his skinny horse several officers
formed a group and some soldiers crowded round them their faces all
looked excited and worried

what did he say what did he say pierre heard them ask

while the marshal was passing the prisoners had huddled together in a
crowd and pierre saw karataev whom he had not yet seen that morning he
sat in his short overcoat leaning against a birch tree on his face
besides the look of joyful emotion it had worn yesterday while telling
the tale of the merchant who suffered innocently there was now an
expression of quiet solemnity

karataev looked at pierre with his kindly round eyes now filled with
tears evidently wishing him to come near that he might say something to
him but pierre was not sufficiently sure of himself he made as if he
did not notice that look and moved hastily away

when the prisoners again went forward pierre looked round karataev was
still sitting at the side of the road under the birch tree and two
frenchmen were talking over his head pierre did not look round again
but went limping up the hill

from behind where karataev had been sitting came the sound of a shot
pierre heard it plainly but at that moment he remembered that he had
not yet finished reckoning up how many stages still remained to
smolenska calculation he had begun before the marshal went by and he
again started reckoning two french soldiers ran past pierre one of
whom carried a lowered and smoking gun they both looked pale and in
the expression on their facesone of them glanced timidly at
pierrethere was something resembling what he had seen on the face of
the young soldier at the execution pierre looked at the soldier and
remembered that two days before that man had burned his shirt while
drying it at the fire and how they had laughed at him

behind him where karataev had been sitting the dog began to howl
what a stupid beast why is it howling thought pierre

his comrades the prisoner soldiers walking beside him avoided looking
back at the place where the shot had been fired and the dog was howling
just as pierre did but there was a set look on all their faces





chapter xv

the stores the prisoners and the marshals baggage train stopped at
the village of shamshevo the men crowded together round the campfires
pierre went up to the fire ate some roast horseflesh lay down with his
back to the fire and immediately fell asleep he again slept as he had
done at mozhaysk after the battle of borodino

again real events mingled with dreams and again someone he or another
gave expression to his thoughts and even to the same thoughts that had
been expressed in his dream at mozhaysk

life is everything life is god everything changes and moves and that
movement is god and while there is life there is joy in consciousness
of the divine to love life is to love god harder and more blessed than
all else is to love this life in ones sufferings in innocent
sufferings

karataev came to pierres mind

and suddenly he saw vividly before him a longforgotten kindly old man
who had given him geography lessons in switzerland wait a bit said
the old man and showed pierre a globe this globe was alivea vibrating
ball without fixed dimensions its whole surface consisted of drops
closely pressed together and all these drops moved and changed places
sometimes several of them merging into one sometimes one dividing into
many each drop tried to spread out and occupy as much space as
possible but others striving to do the same compressed it sometimes
destroyed it and sometimes merged with it

that is life said the old teacher

how simple and clear it is thought pierre how is it i did not know
it before

god is in the midst and each drop tries to expand so as to reflect him
to the greatest extent and it grows merges disappears from the
surface sinks to the depths and again emerges there now karataev has
spread out and disappeared do you understand my child said the
teacher

do you understand damn you shouted a voice and pierre woke up

he lifted himself and sat up a frenchman who had just pushed a russian
soldier away was squatting by the fire engaged in roasting a piece of
meat stuck on a ramrod his sleeves were rolled up and his sinewy
hairy red hands with their short fingers deftly turned the ramrod his
brown morose face with frowning brows was clearly visible by the glow of
the charcoal

its all the same to him he muttered turning quickly to a soldier
who stood behind him brigand get away

and twisting the ramrod he looked gloomily at pierre who turned away
and gazed into the darkness a prisoner the russian soldier the
frenchman had pushed away was sitting near the fire patting something
with his hand looking more closely pierre recognized the bluegray dog
sitting beside the soldier wagging its tail

ah hes come said pierre and plat he began but did not finish

suddenly and simultaneously a crowd of memories awoke in his fancyof
the look platon had given him as he sat under the tree of the shot
heard from that spot of the dogs howl of the guilty faces of the two
frenchmen as they ran past him of the lowered and smoking gun and of
karataevs absence at this haltand he was on the point of realizing
that karataev had been killed but just at that instant he knew not
why the recollection came to his mind of a summer evening he had spent
with a beautiful polish lady on the veranda of his house in kiev and
without linking up the events of the day or drawing a conclusion from
them pierre closed his eyes seeing a vision of the country in
summertime mingled with memories of bathing and of the liquid vibrating
globe and he sank into water so that it closed over his head

before sunrise he was awakened by shouts and loud and rapid firing
french soldiers were running past him

the cossacks one of them shouted and a moment later a crowd of
russians surrounded pierre

for a long time he could not understand what was happening to him all
around he heard his comrades sobbing with joy

brothers dear fellows darlings old soldiers exclaimed weeping as
they embraced cossacks and hussars

the hussars and cossacks crowded round the prisoners one offered them
clothes another boots and a third bread pierre sobbed as he sat among
them and could not utter a word he hugged the first soldier who
approached him and kissed him weeping

dólokhov stood at the gate of the ruined house letting a crowd of
disarmed frenchmen pass by the french excited by all that had
happened were talking loudly among themselves but as they passed
dólokhov who gently switched his boots with his whip and watched them
with cold glassy eyes that boded no good they became silent on the
opposite side stood dólokhovs cossack counting the prisoners and
marking off each hundred with a chalk line on the gate

how many dólokhov asked the cossack

the second hundred replied the cossack

filez filez  dólokhov kept saying having adopted this expression
from the french and when his eyes met those of the prisoners they
flashed with a cruel light

 get along get along

denisov bareheaded and with a gloomy face walked behind some cossacks
who were carrying the body of pétya rostóv to a hole that had been dug
in the garden





chapter xvi

after the twentyeighth of october when the frosts began the flight of
the french assumed a still more tragic character with men freezing or
roasting themselves to death at the campfires while carriages with
people dressed in furs continued to drive past carrying away the
property that had been stolen by the emperor kings and dukes but the
process of the flight and disintegration of the french army went on
essentially as before

from moscow to vyazma the french army of seventythree thousand men not
reckoning the guards who did nothing during the whole war but pillage
was reduced to thirtysix thousand though not more than five thousand
had fallen in battle from this beginning the succeeding terms of the
progression could be determined mathematically the french army melted
away and perished at the same rate from moscow to vyazma from vyazma to
smolensk from smolensk to the berezina and from the berezina to
vilnaindependently of the greater or lesser intensity of the cold the
pursuit the barring of the way or any other particular conditions
beyond vyazma the french army instead of moving in three columns huddled
together into one mass and so went on to the end berthier wrote to his
emperor we know how far commanding officers allow themselves to diverge
from the truth in describing the condition of an army and this is what
he said

i deem it my duty to report to your majesty the condition of the various
corps i have had occasion to observe during different stages of the last
two or three days march they are almost disbanded scarcely a quarter
of the soldiers remain with the standards of their regiments the others
go off by themselves in different directions hoping to find food and
escape discipline in general they regard smolensk as the place where
they hope to recover during the last few days many of the men have been
seen to throw away their cartridges and their arms in such a state of
affairs whatever your ultimate plans may be the interest of your
majestys service demands that the army should be rallied at smolensk
and should first of all be freed from ineffectives such as dismounted
cavalry unnecessary baggage and artillery material that is no longer
in proportion to the present forces the soldiers who are worn out with
hunger and fatigue need these supplies as well as a few days rest
many have died these last days on the road or at the bivouacs this
state of things is continually becoming worse and makes one fear that
unless a prompt remedy is applied the troops will no longer be under
control in case of an engagement

november  twenty miles from smolensk

after staggering into smolensk which seemed to them a promised land the
french searching for food killed one another sacked their own stores
and when everything had been plundered fled farther

they all went without knowing whither or why they were going still less
did that genius napoleon know it for no one issued any orders to him
but still he and those about him retained their old habits wrote
commands letters reports and orders of the day called one another
sire mon cousin prince deckmuhl roi de naples and so on but these
orders and reports were only on paper nothing in them was acted upon
for they could not be carried out and though they entitled one another
majesties highnesses or cousins they all felt that they were
miserable wretches who had done much evil for which they had now to pay
and though they pretended to be concerned about the army each was
thinking only of himself and of how to get away quickly and save
himself





chapter xvii

the movements of the russian and french armies during the campaign from
moscow back to the niemen were like those in a game of russian
blindmans bluff in which two players are blindfolded and one of them
occasionally rings a little bell to inform the catcher of his
whereabouts first he rings his bell fearlessly but when he gets into a
tight place he runs away as quietly as he can and often thinking to
escape runs straight into his opponents arms

at first while they were still moving along the kaluga road napoleons
armies made their presence known but later when they reached the
smolensk road they ran holding the clapper of their bell tightand often
thinking they were escaping ran right into the russians

owing to the rapidity of the french flight and the russian pursuit and
the consequent exhaustion of the horses the chief means of
approximately ascertaining the enemys positionby cavalry scoutingwas
not available besides as a result of the frequent and rapid change of
position by each army even what information was obtained could not be
delivered in time if news was received one day that the enemy had been
in a certain position the day before by the third day when something
could have been done that army was already two days march farther on
and in quite another position

one army fled and the other pursued beyond smolensk there were several
different roads available for the french and one would have thought
that during their stay of four days they might have learned where the
enemy was might have arranged some more advantageous plan and
undertaken something new but after a four days halt the mob with no
maneuvers or plans again began running along the beaten track neither
to the right nor to the left but along the oldthe worstroad through
krasnoe and orsha

expecting the enemy from behind and not in front the french separated
in their flight and spread out over a distance of twentyfour hours in
front of them all fled the emperor then the kings then the dukes the
russian army expecting napoleon to take the road to the right beyond
the dnieperwhich was the only reasonable thing for him to dothemselves
turned to the right and came out onto the highroad at krasnoe and here
as in a game of blindmans buff the french ran into our vanguard seeing
their enemy unexpectedly the french fell into confusion and stopped
short from the sudden fright but then they resumed their flight
abandoning their comrades who were farther behind then for three days
separate portions of the french armyfirst murats the vicekings
then davouts and then neysran as it were the gauntlet of the
russian army they abandoned one another abandoned all their heavy
baggage their artillery and half their men and fled getting past the
russians by night by making semicircles to the right

ney who came last had been busying himself blowing up the walls of
smolensk which were in nobodys way because despite the unfortunate
plight of the french or because of it they wished to punish the floor
against which they had hurt themselves ney who had had a corps of ten
thousand men reached napoleon at orsha with only one thousand men left
having abandoned all the rest and all his cannon and having crossed the
dnieper at night by stealth at a wooded spot

from orsha they fled farther along the road to vilna still playing at
blindmans buff with the pursuing army at the berezina they again
became disorganized many were drowned and many surrendered but those
who got across the river fled farther their supreme chief donned a fur
coat and having seated himself in a sleigh galloped on alone
abandoning his companions the others who could do so drove away too
leaving those who could not to surrender or die





chapter xviii

this campaign consisted in a flight of the french during which they did
all they could to destroy themselves from the time they turned onto the
kaluga road to the day their leader fled from the army none of the
movements of the crowd had any sense so one might have thought that
regarding this period of the campaign the historians who attributed the
actions of the mass to the will of one man would have found it
impossible to make the story of the retreat fit their theory but no
mountains of books have been written by the historians about this
campaign and everywhere are described napoleons arrangements the
maneuvers and his profound plans which guided the army as well as the
military genius shown by his marshals

the retreat from maloyaroslavets when he had a free road into a well
supplied district and the parallel road was open to him along which
kutúzov afterwards pursued himthis unnecessary retreat along a
devastated roadis explained to us as being due to profound
considerations similarly profound considerations are given for his
retreat from smolensk to orsha then his heroism at krasnoe is
described where he is reported to have been prepared to accept battle
and take personal command and to have walked about with a birch stick
and said

jai assez fait lempereur il est temps de faire le general  but
nevertheless immediately ran away again abandoning to its fate the
scattered fragments of the army he left behind

 i have acted the emperor long enough it is time to act the general

then we are told of the greatness of soul of the marshals especially of
neya greatness of soul consisting in this that he made his way by
night around through the forest and across the dnieper and escaped to
orsha abandoning standards artillery and nine tenths of his men

and lastly the final departure of the great emperor from his heroic
army is presented to us by the historians as something great and
characteristic of genius even that final running away described in
ordinary language as the lowest depth of baseness which every child is
taught to be ashamed ofeven that act finds justification in the
historians language

when it is impossible to stretch the very elastic threads of historical
ratiocination any farther when actions are clearly contrary to all that
humanity calls right or even just the historians produce a saving
conception of greatness greatness it seems excludes the standards
of right and wrong for the great man nothing is wrong there is no
atrocity for which a great man can be blamed

cest grand  say the historians and there no longer exists either
good or evil but only grand and not grand grand is good not grand
is bad grand is the characteristic in their conception of some
special animals called heroes and napoleon escaping home in a warm
fur coat and leaving to perish those who were not merely his comrades
but were in his opinion men he had brought there feels que cest
grand  and his soul is tranquil

 it is great

  that it is great

du sublime he saw something sublime in himself au ridicule il ny a
quun pas  said he and the whole world for fifty years has been
repeating sublime grand napoleon le grand du sublime au ridicule
il ny a quun pas

 from the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step

and it occurs to no one that to admit a greatness not commensurable with
the standard of right and wrong is merely to admit ones own nothingness
and immeasurable meanness

for us with the standard of good and evil given us by christ no human
actions are incommensurable and there is no greatness where simplicity
goodness and truth are absent





chapter xix

what russian reading the account of the last part of the campaign of
 has not experienced an uncomfortable feeling of regret
dissatisfaction and perplexity who has not asked himself how it is
that the french were not all captured or destroyed when our three armies
surrounded them in superior numbers when the disordered french hungry
and freezing surrendered in crowds and when as the historians relate
the aim of the russians was to stop the french to cut them off and
capture them all

how was it that the russian army which when numerically weaker than the
french had given battle at borodino did not achieve its purpose when it
had surrounded the french on three sides and when its aim was to capture
them can the french be so enormously superior to us that when we had
surrounded them with superior forces we could not beat them how could
that happen

history or what is called by that name replying to these questions
says that this occurred because kutúzov and tormasov and chichagov and
this man and that man did not execute such and such maneuvers

but why did they not execute those maneuvers and why if they were
guilty of not carrying out a prearranged plan were they not tried and
punished but even if we admitted that kutúzov chichagov and others
were the cause of the russian failures it is still incomprehensible
why the position of the russian army being what it was at krasnoe and
at the berezina in both cases we had superior forces the french army
with its marshals kings and emperor was not captured if that was what
the russians aimed at

the explanation of this strange fact given by russian military
historians to the effect that kutúzov hindered an attack is unfounded
for we know that he could not restrain the troops from attacking at
vyazma and tarutino

why was the russian armywhich with inferior forces had withstood the
enemy in full strength at borodinodefeated at krasnoe and the berezina
by the disorganized crowds of the french when it was numerically
superior

if the aim of the russians consisted in cutting off and capturing
napoleon and his marshalsand that aim was not merely frustrated but all
attempts to attain it were most shamefully baffledthen this last period
of the campaign is quite rightly considered by the french to be a series
of victories and quite wrongly considered victorious by russian
historians

the russian military historians in so far as they submit to claims of
logic must admit that conclusion and in spite of their lyrical
rhapsodies about valor devotion and so forth must reluctantly admit
that the french retreat from moscow was a series of victories for
napoleon and defeats for kutúzov

but putting national vanity entirely aside one feels that such a
conclusion involves a contradiction since the series of french
victories brought the french complete destruction while the series of
russian defeats led to the total destruction of their enemy and the
liberation of their country

the source of this contradiction lies in the fact that the historians
studying the events from the letters of the sovereigns and the generals
from memoirs reports projects and so forth have attributed to this
last period of the war of  an aim that never existed namely that of
cutting off and capturing napoleon with his marshals and his army

there never was or could have been such an aim for it would have been
senseless and its attainment quite impossible

it would have been senseless first because napoleons disorganized army
was flying from russia with all possible speed that is to say was
doing just what every russian desired so what was the use of performing
various operations on the french who were running away as fast as they
possibly could

secondly it would have been senseless to block the passage of men whose
whole energy was directed to flight

thirdly it would have been senseless to sacrifice ones own troops in
order to destroy the french army which without external interference
was destroying itself at such a rate that though its path was not
blocked it could not carry across the frontier more than it actually
did in december namely a hundredth part of the original army

fourthly it would have been senseless to wish to take captive the
emperor kings and dukeswhose capture would have been in the highest
degree embarrassing for the russians as the most adroit diplomatists of
the time joseph de maistre and others recognized still more senseless
would have been the wish to capture army corps of the french when our
own army had melted away to half before reaching krasnoe and a whole
division would have been needed to convoy the corps of prisoners and
when our men were not always getting full rations and the prisoners
already taken were perishing of hunger

all the profound plans about cutting off and capturing napoleon and his
army were like the plan of a market gardener who when driving out of
his garden a cow that had trampled down the beds he had planted should
run to the gate and hit the cow on the head the only thing to be said
in excuse of that gardener would be that he was very angry but not even
that could be said for those who drew up this project for it was not
they who had suffered from the trampled beds

but besides the fact that cutting off napoleon with his army would have
been senseless it was impossible

it was impossible first becauseas experience shows that a threemile
movement of columns on a battlefield never coincides with the plansthe
probability of chichagov kutúzov and wittgenstein effecting a junction
on time at an appointed place was so remote as to be tantamount to
impossibility as in fact thought kutúzov who when he received the plan
remarked that diversions planned over great distances do not yield the
desired results

secondly it was impossible because to paralyze the momentum with which
napoleons army was retiring incomparably greater forces than the
russians possessed would have been required

thirdly it was impossible because the military term to cut off has no
meaning one can cut off a slice of bread but not an army to cut off
an armyto bar its roadis quite impossible for there is always plenty
of room to avoid capture and there is the night when nothing can be
seen as the military scientists might convince themselves by the
example of krasnoe and of the berezina it is only possible to capture
prisoners if they agree to be captured just as it is only possible to
catch a swallow if it settles on ones hand men can only be taken
prisoners if they surrender according to the rules of strategy and
tactics as the germans did but the french troops quite rightly did not
consider that this suited them since death by hunger and cold awaited
them in flight or captivity alike

fourthly and chiefly it was impossible because never since the world
began has a war been fought under such conditions as those that obtained
in  and the russian army in its pursuit of the french strained its
strength to the utmost and could not have done more without destroying
itself

during the movement of the russian army from tarutino to krasnoe it lost
fifty thousand sick or stragglers that is a number equal to the
population of a large provincial town half the men fell out of the army
without a battle

and it is of this period of the campaignwhen the army lacked boots and
sheepskin coats was short of provisions and without vodka and was
camping out at night for months in the snow with fifteen degrees of
frost when there were only seven or eight hours of daylight and the
rest was night in which the influence of discipline cannot be
maintained when men were taken into that region of death where
discipline fails not for a few hours only as in a battle but for
months where they were every moment fighting death from hunger and
cold when half the army perished in a single monthit is of this period
of the campaign that the historians tell us how miloradovich should have
made a flank march to such and such a place tormasov to another place
and chichagov should have crossed more than kneedeep in snow to
somewhere else and how soandso routed and cut off the french and
so on and so on

the russians half of whom died did all that could and should have been
done to attain an end worthy of the nation and they are not to blame
because other russians sitting in warm rooms proposed that they should
do what was impossible

all that strange contradiction now difficult to understand between the
facts and the historical accounts only arises because the historians
dealing with the matter have written the history of the beautiful words
and sentiments of various generals and not the history of the events

to them the words of miloradovich seem very interesting and so do their
surmises and the rewards this or that general received but the question
of those fifty thousand men who were left in hospitals and in graves
does not even interest them for it does not come within the range of
their investigation

yet one need only discard the study of the reports and general plans and
consider the movement of those hundreds of thousands of men who took a
direct part in the events and all the questions that seemed insoluble
easily and simply receive an immediate and certain solution

the aim of cutting off napoleon and his army never existed except in the
imaginations of a dozen people it could not exist because it was
senseless and unattainable

the people had a single aim to free their land from invasion that aim
was attained in the first place of itself as the french ran away and
so it was only necessary not to stop their flight secondly it was
attained by the guerrilla warfare which was destroying the french and
thirdly by the fact that a large russian army was following the french
ready to use its strength in case their movement stopped

the russian army had to act like a whip to a running animal and the
experienced driver knew it was better to hold the whip raised as a
menace than to strike the running animal on the head





book fifteen





chapter i

when seeing a dying animal a man feels a sense of horror substance
similar to his own is perishing before his eyes but when it is a
beloved and intimate human being that is dying besides this horror at
the extinction of life there is a severance a spiritual wound which
like a physical wound is sometimes fatal and sometimes heals but always
aches and shrinks at any external irritating touch

after prince andrews death natásha and princess mary alike felt this
drooping in spirit and closing their eyes before the menacing cloud of
death that overhung them they dared not look life in the face they
carefully guarded their open wounds from any rough and painful contact
everything a carriage passing rapidly in the street a summons to
dinner the maids inquiry what dress to prepare or worse still any
word of insincere or feeble sympathy seemed an insult painfully
irritated the wound interrupting that necessary quiet in which they
both tried to listen to the stern and dreadful choir that still
resounded in their imagination and hindered their gazing into those
mysterious limitless vistas that for an instant had opened out before
them

only when alone together were they free from such outrage and pain they
spoke little even to one another and when they did it was of very
unimportant matters

both avoided any allusion to the future to admit the possibility of a
future seemed to them to insult his memory still more carefully did
they avoid anything relating to him who was dead it seemed to them that
what they had lived through and experienced could not be expressed in
words and that any reference to the details of his life infringed the
majesty and sacredness of the mystery that had been accomplished before
their eyes

continued abstention from speech and constant avoidance of everything
that might lead up to the subjectthis halting on all sides at the
boundary of what they might not mentionbrought before their minds with
still greater purity and clearness what they were both feeling

but pure and complete sorrow is as impossible as pure and complete joy
princess mary in her position as absolute and independent arbiter of
her own fate and guardian and instructor of her nephew was the first to
be called back to life from that realm of sorrow in which she had dwelt
for the first fortnight she received letters from her relations to
which she had to reply the room in which little nicholas had been put
was damp and he began to cough alpatych came to yaroslavl with reports
on the state of their affairs and with advice and suggestions that they
should return to moscow to the house on the vozdvizhenka street which
had remained uninjured and needed only slight repairs life did not
stand still and it was necessary to live hard as it was for princess
mary to emerge from the realm of secluded contemplation in which she had
lived till then and sorry and almost ashamed as she felt to leave
natásha alone yet the cares of life demanded her attention and she
involuntarily yielded to them she went through the accounts with
alpatych conferred with dessalles about her nephew and gave orders and
made preparations for the journey to moscow

natásha remained alone and from the time princess mary began making
preparations for departure held aloof from her too

princess mary asked the countess to let natásha go with her to moscow
and both parents gladly accepted this offer for they saw their daughter
losing strength every day and thought that a change of scene and the
advice of moscow doctors would be good for her

i am not going anywhere natásha replied when this was proposed to
her do please just leave me alone and she ran out of the room with
difficulty refraining from tears of vexation and irritation rather than
of sorrow

after she felt herself deserted by princes mary and alone in her grief
natásha spent most of the time in her room by herself sitting huddled
up feet and all in the corner of the sofa tearing and twisting
something with her slender nervous fingers and gazing intently and
fixedly at whatever her eyes chanced to fall on this solitude exhausted
and tormented her but she was in absolute need of it as soon as anyone
entered she got up quickly changed her position and expression and
picked up a book or some sewing evidently waiting impatiently for the
intruder to go

she felt all the time as if she might at any moment penetrate that on
whichwith a terrible questioning too great for her strengthher
spiritual gaze was fixed

one day toward the end of december natásha pale and thin dressed in a
black woolen gown her plaited hair negligently twisted into a knot was
crouched feet and all in the corner of her sofa nervously crumpling and
smoothing out the end of her sash while she looked at a corner of the
door

she was gazing in the direction in which he had goneto the other side
of life and that other side of life of which she had never before
thought and which had formerly seemed to her so far away and improbable
was now nearer and more akin and more comprehensible than this side of
life where everything was either emptiness and desolation or suffering
and indignity

she was gazing where she knew him to be but she could not imagine him
otherwise than as he had been here she now saw him again as he had been
at mytishchi at troitsa and at yaroslavl

she saw his face heard his voice repeated his words and her own and
sometimes devised other words they might have spoken

there he is lying back in an armchair in his velvet cloak leaning his
head on his thin pale hand his chest is dreadfully hollow and his
shoulders raised his lips are firmly closed his eyes glitter and a
wrinkle comes and goes on his pale forehead one of his legs twitches
just perceptibly but rapidly natásha knows that he is struggling with
terrible pain what is that pain like why does he have that pain what
does he feel how does it hurt him thought natásha he noticed her
watching him raised his eyes and began to speak seriously

one thing would be terrible said he to bind oneself forever to a
suffering man it would be continual torture and he looked searchingly
at her natásha as usual answered before she had time to think what she
would say she said this cant go onit wont you will get wellquite
well

she now saw him from the commencement of that scene and relived what she
had then felt she recalled his long sad and severe look at those words
and understood the meaning of the rebuke and despair in that protracted
gaze

i agreed natásha now said to herself that it would be dreadful if
he always continued to suffer i said it then only because it would have
been dreadful for him but he understood it differently he thought it
would be dreadful for me he then still wished to live and feared death
and i said it so awkwardly and stupidly i did not say what i meant i
thought quite differently had i said what i thought i should have
said even if he had to go on dying to die continually before my eyes
i should have been happy compared with what i am now now there is
nothing nobody did he know that no he did not and never will know
it and now it will never never be possible to put it right and now
he again seemed to be saying the same words to her only in her
imagination natásha this time gave him a different answer she stopped
him and said terrible for you but not for me you know that for me
there is nothing in life but you and to suffer with you is the greatest
happiness for me and he took her hand and pressed it as he had pressed
it that terrible evening four days before his death and in her
imagination she said other tender and loving words which she might have
said then but only spoke now i love thee thee i love love
she said convulsively pressing her hands and setting her teeth with a
desperate effort

she was overcome by sweet sorrow and tears were already rising in her
eyes then she suddenly asked herself to whom she was saying this again
everything was shrouded in hard dry perplexity and again with a
strained frown she peered toward the world where he was and now now it
seemed to her she was penetrating the mystery but at the instant
when it seemed that the incomprehensible was revealing itself to her a
loud rattle of the door handle struck painfully on her ears dunyasha
her maid entered the room quickly and abruptly with a frightened look
on her face and showing no concern for her mistress

come to your papa at once please said she with a strange excited
look a misfortune about peter ilynich a letter she finished
with a sob





chapter ii

besides a feeling of aloofness from everybody natásha was feeling a
special estrangement from the members of her own family all of themher
father mother and sónyawere so near to her so familiar so
commonplace that all their words and feelings seemed an insult to the
world in which she had been living of late and she felt not merely
indifferent to them but regarded them with hostility she heard
dunyashas words about peter ilynich and a misfortune but did not grasp
them

what misfortune what misfortune can happen to them they just live
their own old quiet and commonplace life thought natásha

as she entered the ballroom her father was hurriedly coming out of her
mothers room his face was puckered up and wet with tears he had
evidently run out of that room to give vent to the sobs that were
choking him when he saw natásha he waved his arms despairingly and
burst into convulsively painful sobs that distorted his soft round face

pe pétya go go she is calling and weeping like a child
and quickly shuffling on his feeble legs to a chair he almost fell into
it covering his face with his hands

suddenly an electric shock seemed to run through natáshas whole being
terrible anguish struck her heart she felt a dreadful ache as if
something was being torn inside her and she were dying but the pain was
immediately followed by a feeling of release from the oppressive
constraint that had prevented her taking part in life the sight of her
father the terribly wild cries of her mother that she heard through the
door made her immediately forget herself and her own grief

she ran to her father but he feebly waved his arm pointing to her
mothers door princess mary pale and with quivering chin came out
from that room and taking natásha by the arm said something to her
natásha neither saw nor heard her she went in with rapid steps pausing
at the door for an instant as if struggling with herself and then ran
to her mother

the countess was lying in an armchair in a strange and awkward position
stretching out and beating her head against the wall sónya and the
maids were holding her arms

natásha natásha cried the countess its not true its not
true hes lying natásha she shrieked pushing those around her
away go away all of you its not true killed ha ha ha
its not true

natásha put one knee on the armchair stooped over her mother embraced
her and with unexpected strength raised her turned her face toward
herself and clung to her

mummy darling i am here my dearest mummy she kept on
whispering not pausing an instant

she did not let go of her mother but struggled tenderly with her
demanded a pillow and hot water and unfastened and tore open her
mothers dress

my dearest darling mummy my precious she whispered
incessantly kissing her head her hands her face and feeling her own
irrepressible and streaming tears tickling her nose and cheeks

the countess pressed her daughters hand closed her eyes and became
quiet for a moment suddenly she sat up with unaccustomed swiftness
glanced vacantly around her and seeing natásha began to press her
daughters head with all her strength then she turned toward her
daughters face which was wincing with pain and gazed long at it

natásha you love me she said in a soft trustful whisper natásha
you would not deceive me youll tell me the whole truth

natásha looked at her with eyes full of tears and in her look there was
nothing but love and an entreaty for forgiveness

my darling mummy she repeated straining all the power of her love to
find some way of taking on herself the excess of grief that crushed her
mother

and again in a futile struggle with reality her mother refusing to
believe that she could live when her beloved boy was killed in the bloom
of life escaped from reality into a world of delirium

natásha did not remember how that day passed nor that night nor the
next day and night she did not sleep and did not leave her mother her
persevering and patient love seemed completely to surround the countess
every moment not explaining or consoling but recalling her to life

during the third night the countess kept very quiet for a few minutes
and natásha rested her head on the arm of her chair and closed her eyes
but opened them again on hearing the bedstead creak the countess was
sitting up in bed and speaking softly

how glad i am you have come you are tired wont you have some tea
natásha went up to her you have improved in looks and grown more
manly continued the countess taking her daughters hand

mamma what are you saying

natásha he is no more no more

and embracing her daughter the countess began to weep for the first
time





chapter iii

princess mary postponed her departure sónya and the count tried to
replace natásha but could not they saw that she alone was able to
restrain her mother from unreasoning despair for three weeks natásha
remained constantly at her mothers side sleeping on a lounge chair in
her room making her eat and drink and talking to her incessantly
because the mere sound of her tender caressing tones soothed her
mother

the mothers wounded spirit could not heal pétyas death had torn from
her half her life when the news of pétyas death had come she had been
a fresh and vigorous woman of fifty but a month later she left her room
a listless old woman taking no interest in life but the same blow that
almost killed the countess this second blow restored natásha to life

a spiritual wound produced by a rending of the spiritual body is like a
physical wound and strange as it may seem just as a deep wound may
heal and its edges join physical and spiritual wounds alike can yet
heal completely only as the result of a vital force from within

natáshas wound healed in that way she thought her life was ended but
her love for her mother unexpectedly showed her that the essence of
lifelovewas still active within her love awoke and so did life

prince andrews last days had bound princess mary and natásha together
this new sorrow brought them still closer to one another princess mary
put off her departure and for three weeks looked after natásha as if
she had been a sick child the last weeks passed in her mothers bedroom
had strained natáshas physical strength

one afternoon noticing natásha shivering with fever princess mary took
her to her own room and made her lie down on the bed natásha lay down
but when princess mary had drawn the blinds and was going away she
called her back

i dont want to sleep mary sit by me a little

you are tiredtry to sleep

no no why did you bring me away she will be asking for me

she is much better she spoke so well today said princess mary

natásha lay on the bed and in the semidarkness of the room scanned
princess marys face

is she like him thought natásha yes like and yet not like but she
is quite original strange new and unknown and she loves me what is
in her heart all that is good but how what is her mind like what
does she think about me yes she is splendid

mary she said timidly drawing princess marys hand to herself
mary you mustnt think me wicked no mary darling how i love you
let us be quite quite friends

and natásha embracing her began kissing her face and hands making
princess mary feel shy but happy by this demonstration of her feelings

from that day a tender and passionate friendship such as exists only
between women was established between princess mary and natásha they
were continually kissing and saying tender things to one another and
spent most of their time together when one went out the other became
restless and hastened to rejoin her together they felt more in harmony
with one another than either of them felt with herself when alone a
feeling stronger than friendship sprang up between them an exclusive
feeling of life being possible only in each others presence

sometimes they were silent for hours sometimes after they were already
in bed they would begin talking and go on till morning they spoke most
of what was long past princess mary spoke of her childhood of her
mother her father and her daydreams and natásha who with a passive
lack of understanding had formerly turned away from that life of
devotion submission and the poetry of christian selfsacrifice now
feeling herself bound to princess mary by affection learned to love her
past too and to understand a side of life previously incomprehensible to
her she did not think of applying submission and selfabnegation to her
own life for she was accustomed to seek other joys but she understood
and loved in another those previously incomprehensible virtues for
princess mary listening to natáshas tales of childhood and early
youth there also opened out a new and hitherto uncomprehended side of
life belief in life and its enjoyment

just as before they never mentioned him so as not to lower as they
thought their exalted feelings by words but this silence about him had
the effect of making them gradually begin to forget him without being
conscious of it

natásha had grown thin and pale and physically so weak that they all
talked about her health and this pleased her but sometimes she was
suddenly overcome by fear not only of death but of sickness weakness
and loss of good looks and involuntarily she examined her bare arm
carefully surprised at its thinness and in the morning noticed her
drawn and as it seemed to her piteous face in her glass it seemed to
her that things must be so and yet it was dreadfully sad

one day she went quickly upstairs and found herself out of breath
unconsciously she immediately invented a reason for going down and
then testing her strength ran upstairs again observing the result

another time when she called dunyasha her voice trembled so she called
againthough she could hear dunyasha comingcalled her in the deep chest
tones in which she had been wont to sing and listened attentively to
herself

she did not know and would not have believed it but beneath the layer
of slime that covered her soul and seemed to her impenetrable delicate
young shoots of grass were already sprouting which taking root would so
cover with their living verdure the grief that weighed her down that it
would soon no longer be seen or noticed the wound had begun to heal
from within

at the end of january princess mary left for moscow and the count
insisted on natáshas going with her to consult the doctors





chapter iv

after the encounter at vyazma where kutúzov had been unable to hold
back his troops in their anxiety to overwhelm and cut off the enemy and
so on the farther movement of the fleeing french and of the russians
who pursued them continued as far as krasnoe without a battle the
flight was so rapid that the russian army pursuing the french could not
keep up with them cavalry and artillery horses broke down and the
information received of the movements of the french was never reliable

the men in the russian army were so worn out by this continuous marching
at the rate of twentyseven miles a day that they could not go any
faster

to realize the degree of exhaustion of the russian army it is only
necessary to grasp clearly the meaning of the fact that while not
losing more than five thousand killed and wounded after tarutino and
less than a hundred prisoners the russian army which left that place a
hundred thousand strong reached krasnoe with only fifty thousand

the rapidity of the russian pursuit was just as destructive to our army
as the flight of the french was to theirs the only difference was that
the russian army moved voluntarily with no such threat of destruction
as hung over the french and that the sick frenchmen were left behind in
enemy hands while the sick russians left behind were among their own
people the chief cause of the wastage of napoleons army was the
rapidity of its movement and a convincing proof of this is the
corresponding decrease of the russian army

kutúzov as far as was in his power instead of trying to check the
movement of the french as was desired in petersburg and by the russian
army generals directed his whole activity here as he had done at
tarutino and vyazma to hastening it on while easing the movement of our
army

but besides this since the exhaustion and enormous diminution of the
army caused by the rapidity of the advance had become evident another
reason for slackening the pace and delaying presented itself to kutúzov
the aim of the russian army was to pursue the french the road the
french would take was unknown and so the closer our troops trod on
their heels the greater distance they had to cover only by following at
some distance could one cut across the zigzag path of the french all
the artful maneuvers suggested by our generals meant fresh movements of
the army and a lengthening of its marches whereas the only reasonable
aim was to shorten those marches to that end kutúzovs activity was
directed during the whole campaign from moscow to vilnanot casually or
intermittently but so consistently that he never once deviated from it

kutúzov felt and knewnot by reasoning or science but with the whole of
his russian beingwhat every russian soldier felt that the french were
beaten that the enemy was flying and must be driven out but at the
same time he like the soldiers realized all the hardship of this march
the rapidity of which was unparalleled for such a time of the year

but to the generals especially the foreign ones in the russian army
who wished to distinguish themselves to astonish somebody and for some
reason to capture a king or a dukeit seemed that nowwhen any battle
must be horrible and senselesswas the very time to fight and conquer
somebody kutúzov merely shrugged his shoulders when one after another
they presented projects of maneuvers to be made with those soldiersill
shod insufficiently clad and half starvedwho within a month and
without fighting a battle had dwindled to half their number and who at
the best if the flight continued would have to go a greater distance
than they had already traversed before they reached the frontier

this longing to distinguish themselves to maneuver to overthrow and
to cut off showed itself particularly whenever the russians stumbled on
the french army

so it was at krasnoe where they expected to find one of the three
french columns and stumbled instead on napoleon himself with sixteen
thousand men despite all kutúzovs efforts to avoid that ruinous
encounter and to preserve his troops the massacre of the broken mob of
french soldiers by wornout russians continued at krasnoe for three
days

toll wrote a disposition the first column will march to so and so
etc and as usual nothing happened in accord with the disposition
prince eugene of wurttemberg fired from a hill over the french crowds
that were running past and demanded reinforcements which did not
arrive the french avoiding the russians dispersed and hid themselves
in the forest by night making their way round as best they could and
continued their flight

miloradovich who said he did not want to know anything about the
commissariat affairs of his detachment and could never be found when he
was wantedthat chevalier sans peur et sans reproche  as he styled
himselfwho was fond of parleys with the french sent envoys demanding
their surrender wasted time and did not do what he was ordered to do

 knight without fear and without reproach

i give you that column lads he said riding up to the troops and
pointing out the french to the cavalry

and the cavalry with spurs and sabers urging on horses that could
scarcely move trotted with much effort to the column presented to
themthat is to say to a crowd of frenchmen stark with cold frost
bitten and starvingand the column that had been presented to them
threw down its arms and surrendered as it had long been anxious to do

at krasnoe they took twentysix thousand prisoners several hundred
cannon and a stick called a marshals staff and disputed as to who
had distinguished himself and were pleased with their achievementthough
they much regretted not having taken napoleon or at least a marshal or
a hero of some sort and reproached one another and especially kutúzov
for having failed to do so

these men carried away by their passions were but blind tools of the
most melancholy law of necessity but considered themselves heroes and
imagined that they were accomplishing a most noble and honorable deed
they blamed kutúzov and said that from the very beginning of the
campaign he had prevented their vanquishing napoleon that he thought of
nothing but satisfying his passions and would not advance from the linen
factories because he was comfortable there that at krasnoe he checked
the advance because on learning that napoleon was there he had quite
lost his head and that it was probable that he had an understanding
with napoleon and had been bribed by him and so on and so on

not only did his contemporaries carried away by their passions talk in
this way but posterity and history have acclaimed napoleon as grand
while kutúzov is described by foreigners as a crafty dissolute weak
old courtier and by russians as something indefinitea sort of puppet
useful only because he had a russian name





chapter v

in  and  kutúzov was openly accused of blundering the emperor
was dissatisfied with him and in a history recently written by order of
the highest authorities it is said that kutúzov was a cunning court
liar frightened of the name of napoleon and that by his blunders at
krasnoe and the berezina he deprived the russian army of the glory of
complete victory over the french

 history of the year  the character of kutúzov and reflections on
the unsatisfactory results of the battles at krasnoe by bogdanovich

such is the fate not of great men grands hommes whom the russian mind
does not acknowledge but of those rare and always solitary individuals
who discerning the will of providence submit their personal will to
it the hatred and contempt of the crowd punish such men for discerning
the higher laws

for russian historians strange and terrible to say napoleonthat most
insignificant tool of history who never anywhere even in exile showed
human dignitynapoleon is the object of adulation and enthusiasm he is
grand but kutúzovthe man who from the beginning to the end of his
activity in  never once swerving by word or deed from borodino to
vilna presented an example exceptional in history of selfsacrifice and
a present consciousness of the future importance of what was
happeningkutúzov seems to them something indefinite and pitiful and
when speaking of him and of the year  they always seem a little
ashamed

and yet it is difficult to imagine an historical character whose
activity was so unswervingly directed to a single aim and it would be
difficult to imagine any aim more worthy or more consonant with the will
of the whole people still more difficult would it be to find an
instance in history of the aim of an historical personage being so
completely accomplished as that to which all kutúzovs efforts were
directed in

kutúzov never talked of forty centuries looking down from the
pyramids of the sacrifices he offered for the fatherland or of what
he intended to accomplish or had accomplished in general he said
nothing about himself adopted no pose always appeared to be the
simplest and most ordinary of men and said the simplest and most
ordinary things he wrote letters to his daughters and to madame de
stael read novels liked the society of pretty women jested with
generals officers and soldiers and never contradicted those who tried
to prove anything to him when count rostopchin at the yauza bridge
galloped up to kutúzov with personal reproaches for having caused the
destruction of moscow and said how was it you promised not to abandon
moscow without a battle kutúzov replied and i shall not abandon
moscow without a battle though moscow was then already abandoned when
arakcheev coming to him from the emperor said that ermolov ought to be
appointed chief of the artillery kutúzov replied yes i was just
saying so myself though a moment before he had said quite the
contrary what did it matter to himwho then alone amid a senseless
crowd understood the whole tremendous significance of what was
happeningwhat did it matter to him whether rostopchin attributed the
calamities of moscow to him or to himself still less could it matter to
him who was appointed chief of the artillery

not merely in these cases but continually did that old manwho by
experience of life had reached the conviction that thoughts and the
words serving as their expression are not what move peopleuse quite
meaningless words that happened to enter his head

but that man so heedless of his words did not once during the whole
time of his activity utter one word inconsistent with the single aim
toward which he moved throughout the whole war obviously in spite of
himself in very diverse circumstances he repeatedly expressed his real
thoughts with the bitter conviction that he would not be understood
beginning with the battle of borodino from which time his disagreement
with those about him began he alone said that the battle of borodino
was a victory and repeated this both verbally and in his dispatches and
reports up to the time of his death he alone said that the loss of
moscow is not the loss of russia in reply to lauristons proposal of
peace he said there can be no peace for such is the peoples will he
alone during the retreat of the french said that all our maneuvers are
useless everything is being accomplished of itself better than we could
desire that the enemy must be offered a golden bridge that neither
the tarutino the vyazma nor the krasnoe battles were necessary that
we must keep some force to reach the frontier with and that he would
not sacrifice a single russian for ten frenchmen

and this courtier as he is described to us who lies to arakcheev to
please the emperor he aloneincurring thereby the emperors
displeasuresaid in vilna that to carry the war beyond the frontier is
useless and harmful

nor do words alone prove that only he understood the meaning of the
events his actionswithout the smallest deviationwere all directed to
one and the same threefold end  to brace all his strength for
conflict with the french  to defeat them and  to drive them out
of russia minimizing as far as possible the sufferings of our people
and of our army

this procrastinator kutúzov whose motto was patience and time this
enemy of decisive action gave battle at borodino investing the
preparations for it with unparalleled solemnity this kutúzov who before
the battle of austerlitz began said that it would be lost he alone in
contradiction to everyone else declared till his death that borodino
was a victory despite the assurance of generals that the battle was
lost and despite the fact that for an army to have to retire after
winning a battle was unprecedented he alone during the whole retreat
insisted that battles which were useless then should not be fought
and that a new war should not be begun nor the frontiers of russia
crossed

it is easy now to understand the significance of these eventsif only we
abstain from attributing to the activity of the mass aims that existed
only in the heads of a dozen individualsfor the events and results now
lie before us

but how did that old man alone in opposition to the general opinion
so truly discern the importance of the peoples view of the events that
in all his activity he was never once untrue to it

the source of that extraordinary power of penetrating the meaning of the
events then occuring lay in the national feeling which he possessed in
full purity and strength

only the recognition of the fact that he possessed this feeling caused
the people in so strange a manner contrary to the tsars wish to
select himan old man in disfavorto be their representative in the
national war and only that feeling placed him on that highest human
pedestal from which he the commanderinchief devoted all his powers
not to slaying and destroying men but to saving and showing pity on
them

that simple modest and therefore truly great figure could not be cast
in the false mold of a european herothe supposed ruler of menthat
history has invented

to a lackey no man can be great for a lackey has his own conception of
greatness





chapter vi

the fifth of november was the first day of what is called the battle of
krasnoe toward eveningafter much disputing and many mistakes made by
generals who did not go to their proper places and after adjutants had
been sent about with counterorderswhen it had become plain that the
enemy was everywhere in flight and that there could and would be no
battle kutúzov left krasnoe and went to dobroe whither his headquarters
had that day been transferred

the day was clear and frosty kutúzov rode to dobroe on his plump little
white horse followed by an enormous suite of discontented generals who
whispered among themselves behind his back all along the road groups of
french prisoners captured that day there were seven thousand of them
were crowding to warm themselves at campfires near dobroe an immense
crowd of tattered prisoners buzzing with talk and wrapped and bandaged
in anything they had been able to get hold of were standing in the road
beside a long row of unharnessed french guns at the approach of the
commanderinchief the buzz of talk ceased and all eyes were fixed on
kutúzov who wearing a white cap with a red band and a padded overcoat
that bulged on his round shoulders moved slowly along the road on his
white horse one of the generals was reporting to him where the guns and
prisoners had been captured

kutúzov seemed preoccupied and did not listen to what the general was
saying he screwed up his eyes with a dissatisfied look as he gazed
attentively and fixedly at these prisoners who presented a specially
wretched appearance most of them were disfigured by frostbitten noses
and cheeks and nearly all had red swollen and festering eyes

one group of the french stood close to the road and two of them one of
whom had his face covered with sores were tearing a piece of raw flesh
with their hands there was something horrible and bestial in the
fleeting glance they threw at the riders and in the malevolent
expression with which after a glance at kutúzov the soldier with the
sores immediately turned away and went on with what he was doing

kutúzov looked long and intently at these two soldiers he puckered his
face screwed up his eyes and pensively swayed his head at another
spot he noticed a russian soldier laughingly patting a frenchman on the
shoulder saying something to him in a friendly manner and kutúzov with
the same expression on his face again swayed his head

what were you saying he asked the general who continuing his report
directed the commanderinchiefs attention to some standards captured
from the french and standing in front of the preobrazhensk regiment

ah the standards said kutúzov evidently detaching himself with
difficulty from the thoughts that preoccupied him

he looked about him absently thousands of eyes were looking at him from
all sides awaiting a word from him

he stopped in front of the preobrazhensk regiment sighed deeply and
closed his eyes one of his suite beckoned to the soldiers carrying the
standards to advance and surround the commanderinchief with them
kutúzov was silent for a few seconds and then submitting with evident
reluctance to the duty imposed by his position raised his head and
began to speak a throng of officers surrounded him he looked
attentively around at the circle of officers recognizing several of
them

i thank you all he said addressing the soldiers and then again the
officers in the stillness around him his slowly uttered words were
distinctly heard i thank you all for your hard and faithful service
the victory is complete and russia will not forget you honor to you
forever

he paused and looked around

lower its head lower it he said to a soldier who had accidentally
lowered the french eagle he was holding before the preobrazhensk
standards lower lower thats it hurrah lads he added addressing
the men with a rapid movement of his chin

hurrrah roared thousands of voices

while the soldiers were shouting kutúzov leaned forward in his saddle
and bowed his head and his eye lit up with a mild and apparently ironic
gleam

you see brothers said he when the shouts had ceased and all at
once his voice and the expression of his face changed it was no longer
the commanderinchief speaking but an ordinary old man who wanted to
tell his comrades something very important

there was a stir among the throng of officers and in the ranks of the
soldiers who moved that they might hear better what he was going to
say

you see brothers i know its hard for you but it cant be helped
bear up it wont be for long now well see our visitors off and then
well rest the tsar wont forget your service it is hard for you but
still you are at home while theyyou see what they have come to said
he pointing to the prisoners worse off than our poorest beggars
while they were strong we didnt spare ourselves but now we may even
pity them they are human beings too isnt it so lads

he looked around and in the direct respectful wondering gaze fixed
upon him he read sympathy with what he had said his face grew brighter
and brighter with an old mans mild smile which drew the corners of his
lips and eyes into a cluster of wrinkles he ceased speaking and bowed
his head as if in perplexity

but after all who asked them here serves them right the bloody
bastards he cried suddenly lifting his head

and flourishing his whip he rode off at a gallop for the first time
during the whole campaign and left the broken ranks of the soldiers
laughing joyfully and shouting hurrah

kutúzovs words were hardly understood by the troops no one could have
repeated the field marshals address begun solemnly and then changing
into an old mans simplehearted talk but the hearty sincerity of that
speech the feeling of majestic triumph combined with pity for the foe
and consciousness of the justice of our cause exactly expressed by that
old mans goodnatured expletives was not merely understood but lay in
the soul of every soldier and found expression in their joyous and long
sustained shouts afterwards when one of the generals addressed kutúzov
asking whether he wished his caleche to be sent for kutúzov in
answering unexpectedly gave a sob being evidently greatly moved





chapter vii

when the troops reached their nights halting place on the eighth of
november the last day of the krasnoe battles it was already growing
dusk all day it had been calm and frosty with occasional lightly
falling snow and toward evening it began to clear through the falling
snow a purpleblack and starry sky showed itself and the frost grew
keener

an infantry regiment which had left tarutino three thousand strong but
now numbered only nine hundred was one of the first to arrive that night
at its halting placea village on the highroad the quartermasters who
met the regiment announced that all the huts were full of sick and dead
frenchmen cavalrymen and members of the staff there was only one hut
available for the regimental commander

the commander rode up to his hut the regiment passed through the
village and stacked its arms in front of the last huts

like some huge manylimbed animal the regiment began to prepare its
lair and its food one part of it dispersed and waded kneedeep through
the snow into a birch forest to the right of the village and
immediately the sound of axes and swords the crashing of branches and
merry voices could be heard from there another section amid the
regimental wagons and horses which were standing in a group was busy
getting out caldrons and rye biscuit and feeding the horses a third
section scattered through the village arranging quarters for the staff
officers carrying out the french corpses that were in the huts and
dragging away boards dry wood and thatch from the roofs for the
campfires or wattle fences to serve for shelter

some fifteen men with merry shouts were shaking down the high wattle
wall of a shed the roof of which had already been removed

now then all togethershove cried the voices and the huge surface
of the wall sprinkled with snow and creaking with frost was seen
swaying in the gloom of the night the lower stakes cracked more and
more and at last the wall fell and with it the men who had been pushing
it loud coarse laughter and joyous shouts ensued

now then catch hold in twos hand up the lever thats it where are
you shoving to

now all together but wait a moment boys with a song

all stood silent and a soft pleasant velvety voice began to sing at
the end of the third verse as the last note died away twenty voices
roared out at once oooooooo thats it all together heave away
boys but despite their united efforts the wattle hardly moved and
in the silence that followed the heavy breathing of the men was audible

here you of the sixth company devils that you are lend a hand
will you you may want us one of these days

some twenty men of the sixth company who were on their way into the
village joined the haulers and the wattle wall which was about thirty
five feet long and seven feet high moved forward along the village
street swaying pressing upon and cutting the shoulders of the gasping
men

get along falling what are you stopping for there now

merry senseless words of abuse flowed freely

what are you up to suddenly came the authoritative voice of a
sergeant major who came upon the men who were hauling their burden
there are gentry here the general himself is in that hut and you
foulmouthed devils you brutes ill give it to you shouted he
hitting the first man who came in his way a swinging blow on the back
cant you make less noise

the men became silent the soldier who had been struck groaned and wiped
his face which had been scratched till it bled by his falling against
the wattle

there how that devil hits out hes made my face all bloody said he
in a frightened whisper when the sergeant major had passed on

dont you like it said a laughing voice and moderating their tones
the men moved forward

when they were out of the village they began talking again as loud as
before interlarding their talk with the same aimless expletives

in the hut which the men had passed the chief officers had gathered and
were in animated talk over their tea about the events of the day and the
maneuvers suggested for tomorrow it was proposed to make a flank march
to the left cut off the viceking murat and capture him

by the time the soldiers had dragged the wattle fence to its place the
campfires were blazing on all sides ready for cooking the wood
crackled the snow was melting and black shadows of soldiers flitted to
and fro all over the occupied space where the snow had been trodden
down

axes and choppers were plied all around everything was done without any
orders being given stores of wood were brought for the night shelters
were rigged up for the officers caldrons were being boiled and muskets
and accouterments put in order

the wattle wall the men had brought was set up in a semicircle by the
eighth company as a shelter from the north propped up by musket rests
and a campfire was built before it they beat the tattoo called the
roll had supper and settled down round the fires for the nightsome
repairing their footgear some smoking pipes and some stripping
themselves naked to steam the lice out of their shirts





chapter viii

one would have thought that under the almost incredibly wretched
conditions the russian soldiers were in at that timelacking warm boots
and sheepskin coats without a roof over their heads in the snow with
eighteen degrees of frost and without even full rations the
commissariat did not always keep up with the troopsthey would have
presented a very sad and depressing spectacle

on the contrary the army had never under the best material conditions
presented a more cheerful and animated aspect this was because all who
began to grow depressed or who lost strength were sifted out of the army
day by day all the physically or morally weak had long since been left
behind and only the flower of the armyphysically and mentallyremained

more men collected behind the wattle fence of the eighth company than
anywhere else two sergeants major were sitting with them and their
campfire blazed brighter than others for leave to sit by their wattle
they demanded contributions of fuel

eh makeev what has become of you you son of a bitch are you lost or
have the wolves eaten you fetch some more wood shouted a redhaired
and redfaced man screwing up his eyes and blinking because of the
smoke but not moving back from the fire and you jackdaw go and fetch
some wood said he to another soldier

this redhaired man was neither a sergeant nor a corporal but being
robust he ordered about those weaker than himself the soldier they
called jackdaw a thin little fellow with a sharp nose rose
obediently and was about to go but at that instant there came into the
light of the fire the slender handsome figure of a young soldier
carrying a load of wood

bring it herethats fine

they split up the wood pressed it down on the fire blew at it with
their mouths and fanned it with the skirts of their greatcoats making
the flames hiss and crackle the men drew nearer and lit their pipes
the handsome young soldier who had brought the wood setting his arms
akimbo began stamping his cold feet rapidly and deftly on the spot
where he stood

mother the dew is cold but clear its well that im a
musketeer he sang pretending to hiccough after each syllable

look out your soles will fly off shouted the redhaired man
noticing that the sole of the dancers boot was hanging loose what a
fellow you are for dancing

the dancer stopped pulled off the loose piece of leather and threw it
on the fire

right enough friend said he and having sat down took out of his
knapsack a scrap of blue french cloth and wrapped it round his foot
its the steam that spoils them he added stretching out his feet
toward the fire

theyll soon be issuing us new ones they say that when weve finished
hammering them were to receive double kits

and that son of a bitch petrov has lagged behind after all it seems
said one sergeant major

ive had an eye on him this long while said the other

well hes a poor sort of soldier

but in the third company they say nine men were missing yesterday

yes its all very well but when a mans feet are frozen how can he
walk

eh dont talk nonsense said a sergeant major

do you want to be doing the same said an old soldier turning
reproachfully to the man who had spoken of frozen feet

well you know said the sharpnosed man they called jackdaw in a
squeaky and unsteady voice raising himself at the other side of the
fire a plump man gets thin but for a thin one its death take me
now ive got no strength left he added with sudden resolution
turning to the sergeant major tell them to send me to hospital im
aching all over anyway i shant be able to keep up

thatll do thatll do replied the sergeant major quietly

the soldier said no more and the talk went on

what a lot of those frenchies were taken today and the fact is that
not one of them had what you might call real boots on said a soldier
starting a new theme they were no more than makebelieves

the cossacks have taken their boots they were clearing the hut for the
colonel and carried them out it was pitiful to see them boys put in
the dancer as they turned them over one seemed still alive and would
you believe it he jabbered something in their lingo

but theyre a clean folk lads the first man went on he was
whiteas white as birchbarkand some of them are such fine fellows you
might think they were nobles

well what do you think they make soldiers of all classes there

but they dont understand our talk at all said the dancer with a
puzzled smile i asked him whose subject he was and he jabbered in his
own way a queer lot

but its strange friends continued the man who had wondered at their
whiteness the peasants at mozhaysk were saying that when they began
burying the deadwhere the battle was you knowwell those dead had been
lying there for nearly a month and says the peasant they lie as white
as paper clean and not as much smell as a puff of powder smoke

was it from the cold asked someone

youre a clever fellow from the cold indeed why it was hot if it
had been from the cold ours would not have rotted either but he
says go up to ours and they are all rotten and maggoty so he says
we tie our faces up with kerchiefs and turn our heads away as we drag
them off we can hardly do it but theirs he says are white as paper
and not so much smell as a whiff of gunpowder

all were silent

it must be from their food said the sergeant major they used to
gobble the same food as the gentry

no one contradicted him

that peasant near mozhaysk where the battle was said the men were all
called up from ten villages around and they carted for twenty days and
still didnt finish carting the dead away and as for the wolves he
says

that was a real battle said an old soldier its the only one worth
remembering but since that its only been tormenting folk

and do you know daddy the day before yesterday we ran at them and my
word they didnt let us get near before they just threw down their
muskets and went on their knees pardon they say thats only one
case they say platov took poleon himself twice but he didnt know the
right charm he catches him and catches himno good he turns into a
bird in his hands and flies away and theres no way of killing him
either

youre a firstclass liar kiselev when i come to look at you

liar indeed its the real truth

if he fell into my hands when id caught him id bury him in the
ground with an aspen stake to fix him down what a lot of men hes
ruined

well anyhow were going to end it he wont come here again remarked
the old soldier yawning

the conversation flagged and the soldiers began settling down to sleep

look at the stars its wonderful how they shine you would think the
women had spread out their linen said one of the men gazing with
admiration at the milky way

thats a sign of a good harvest next year

we shall want some more wood

you warm your back and your belly gets frozen thats queer

o lord

what are you pushing for is the fire only for you look how hes
sprawling

in the silence that ensued the snoring of those who had fallen asleep
could be heard others turned over and warmed themselves now and again
exchanging a few words from a campfire a hundred paces off came a sound
of general merry laughter

hark at them roaring there in the fifth company said one of the
soldiers and what a lot of them there are

one of the men got up and went over to the fifth company

theyre having such fun said he coming back two frenchies have
turned up ones quite frozen and the others an awful swaggerer hes
singing songs

oh ill go across and have a look

and several of the men went over to the fifth company





chapter ix

the fifth company was bivouacking at the very edge of the forest a huge
campfire was blazing brightly in the midst of the snow lighting up the
branches of trees heavy with hoarfrost

about midnight they heard the sound of steps in the snow of the forest
and the crackling of dry branches

a bear lads said one of the men

they all raised their heads to listen and out of the forest into the
bright firelight stepped two strangely clad human figures clinging to
one another

these were two frenchmen who had been hiding in the forest they came up
to the fire hoarsely uttering something in a language our soldiers did
not understand one was taller than the other he wore an officers hat
and seemed quite exhausted on approaching the fire he had been going to
sit down but fell the other a short sturdy soldier with a shawl tied
round his head was stronger he raised his companion and said
something pointing to his mouth the soldiers surrounded the frenchmen
spread a greatcoat on the ground for the sick man and brought some
buckwheat porridge and vodka for both of them

the exhausted french officer was ramballe and the man with his head
wrapped in the shawl was morel his orderly

when morel had drunk some vodka and finished his bowl of porridge he
suddenly became unnaturally merry and chattered incessantly to the
soldiers who could not understand him ramballe refused food and
resting his head on his elbow lay silent beside the campfire looking at
the russian soldiers with red and vacant eyes occasionally he emitted a
longdrawn groan and then again became silent morel pointing to his
shoulders tried to impress on the soldiers the fact that ramballe was
an officer and ought to be warmed a russian officer who had come up to
the fire sent to ask his colonel whether he would not take a french
officer into his hut to warm him and when the messenger returned and
said that the colonel wished the officer to be brought to him ramballe
was told to go he rose and tried to walk but staggered and would have
fallen had not a soldier standing by held him up

you wont do it again eh said one of the soldiers winking and
turning mockingly to ramballe

oh you fool why talk rubbish lout that you area real peasant came
rebukes from all sides addressed to the jesting soldier

they surrounded ramballe lifted him on the crossed arms of two
soldiers and carried him to the hut ramballe put his arms around their
necks while they carried him and began wailing plaintively

oh you fine fellows my kind kind friends these are men oh my
brave kind friends and he leaned his head against the shoulder of one
of the men like a child

meanwhile morel was sitting in the best place by the fire surrounded by
the soldiers

morel a short sturdy frenchman with inflamed and streaming eyes was
wearing a womans cloak and had a shawl tied woman fashion round his
head over his cap he was evidently tipsy and was singing a french song
in a hoarse broken voice with an arm thrown round the nearest soldier
the soldiers simply held their sides as they watched him

now then now then teach us how it goes ill soon pick it up how is
it said the mana singer and a wagwhom morel was embracing

vive henri quatre vive ce roi valiant sang morel winking ce
diable a quatre

 long live henry the fourth that valiant king that rowdy devil

vivarika vifseruvaru sedyablyaka repeated the soldier flourishing
his arm and really catching the tune

bravo ha ha ha rose their rough joyous laughter from all sides

morel wrinkling up his face laughed too

well go on go on

qui eut le triple talent de boire de battre et detre un vert
galant

 who had a triple talent for drinking for fighting and for being a
gallant old boy

it goes smoothly too well now zaletaev

ke zaletaev brought out with effort keeee he drawled
laboriously pursing his lips letriptaladebudeba e detrava
gala he sang

fine just like the frenchie oh ho ho do you want some more to eat

give him some porridge it takes a long time to get filled up after
starving

they gave him some more porridge and morel with a laugh set to work on
his third bowl all the young soldiers smiled gaily as they watched him
the older men who thought it undignified to amuse themselves with such
nonsense continued to lie at the opposite side of the fire but one
would occasionally raise himself on an elbow and glance at morel with a
smile

they are men too said one of them as he wrapped himself up in his
coat even wormwood grows on its own root

o lord o lord how starry it is tremendous that means a hard
frost

they all grew silent the stars as if knowing that no one was looking
at them began to disport themselves in the dark sky now flaring up
now vanishing now trembling they were busy whispering something
gladsome and mysterious to one another





chapter x

the french army melted away at the uniform rate of a mathematical
progression and that crossing of the berezina about which so much has
been written was only one intermediate stage in its destruction and not
at all the decisive episode of the campaign if so much has been and
still is written about the berezina on the french side this is only
because at the broken bridge across that river the calamities their army
had been previously enduring were suddenly concentrated at one moment
into a tragic spectacle that remained in every memory and on the
russian side merely because in petersburgfar from the seat of wara
plan again one of pfuels had been devised to catch napoleon in a
strategic trap at the berezina river everyone assured himself that all
would happen according to plan and therefore insisted that it was just
the crossing of the berezina that destroyed the french army in reality
the results of the crossing were much less disastrous to the frenchin
guns and men lostthan krasnoe had been as the figures show

the sole importance of the crossing of the berezina lies in the fact
that it plainly and indubitably proved the fallacy of all the plans for
cutting off the enemys retreat and the soundness of the only possible
line of actionthe one kutúzov and the general mass of the army
demandednamely simply to follow the enemy up the french crowd fled at
a continually increasing speed and all its energy was directed to
reaching its goal it fled like a wounded animal and it was impossible
to block its path this was shown not so much by the arrangements it
made for crossing as by what took place at the bridges when the bridges
broke down unarmed soldiers people from moscow and women with children
who were with the french transport allcarried on by vis
inertiaepressed forward into boats and into the icecovered water and
did not surrender

that impulse was reasonable the condition of fugitives and of pursuers
was equally bad as long as they remained with their own people each
might hope for help from his fellows and the definite place he held
among them but those who surrendered while remaining in the same
pitiful plight would be on a lower level to claim a share in the
necessities of life the french did not need to be informed of the fact
that half the prisonerswith whom the russians did not know what to
doperished of cold and hunger despite their captors desire to save
them they felt that it could not be otherwise the most compassionate
russian commanders those favorable to the frenchand even the frenchmen
in the russian servicecould do nothing for the prisoners the french
perished from the conditions to which the russian army was itself
exposed it was impossible to take bread and clothes from our hungry and
indispensable soldiers to give to the french who though not harmful or
hated or guilty were simply unnecessary some russians even did that
but they were exceptions

certain destruction lay behind the french but in front there was hope
their ships had been burned there was no salvation save in collective
flight and on that the whole strength of the french was concentrated

the farther they fled the more wretched became the plight of the
remnant especially after the berezina on which in consequence of the
petersburg plan special hopes had been placed by the russians and the
keener grew the passions of the russian commanders who blamed one
another and kutúzov most of all anticipation that the failure of the
petersburg berezina plan would be attributed to kutúzov led to
dissatisfaction contempt and ridicule more and more strongly
expressed the ridicule and contempt were of course expressed in a
respectful form making it impossible for him to ask wherein he was to
blame they did not talk seriously to him when reporting to him or
asking for his sanction they appeared to be fulfilling a regrettable
formality but they winked behind his back and tried to mislead him at
every turn

because they could not understand him all these people assumed that it
was useless to talk to the old man that he would never grasp the
profundity of their plans that he would answer with his phrases which
they thought were mere phrases about a golden bridge about the
impossibility of crossing the frontier with a crowd of tatterdemalions
and so forth they had heard all that before and all he saidthat it
was necessary to await provisions or that the men had no bootswas so
simple while what they proposed was so complicated and clever that it
was evident that he was old and stupid and that they though not in
power were commanders of genius

after the junction with the army of the brilliant admiral and petersburg
hero wittgenstein this mood and the gossip of the staff reached their
maximum kutúzov saw this and merely sighed and shrugged his shoulders
only once after the affair of the berezina did he get angry and write
to bennigsen who reported separately to the emperor the following
letter

on account of your spells of ill health will your excellency please be
so good as to set off for kaluga on receipt of this and there await
further commands and appointments from his imperial majesty

but after bennigsens departure the grand duke tsarevich constantine
pavlovich joined the army he had taken part in the beginning of the
campaign but had subsequently been removed from the army by kutúzov now
having come to the army he informed kutúzov of the emperors
displeasure at the poor success of our forces and the slowness of their
advance the emperor intended to join the army personally in a few days
time

the old man experienced in court as well as in military affairsthis
same kutúzov who in august had been chosen commanderinchief against
the sovereigns wishes and who had removed the grand duke and
heirapparent from the armywho on his own authority and contrary to the
emperors will had decided on the abandonment of moscow now realized at
once that his day was over that his part was played and that the power
he was supposed to hold was no longer his and he understood this not
merely from the attitude of the court he saw on the one hand that the
military business in which he had played his part was ended and felt
that his mission was accomplished and at the same time he began to be
conscious of the physical weariness of his aged body and of the
necessity of physical rest

on the twentyninth of november kutúzov entered vilnahis dear vilna
as he called it twice during his career kutúzov had been governor of
vilna in that wealthy town which had not been injured he found old
friends and associations besides the comforts of life of which he had
so long been deprived and he suddenly turned from the cares of army and
state and as far as the passions that seethed around him allowed
immersed himself in the quiet life to which he had formerly been
accustomed as if all that was taking place and all that had still to be
done in the realm of history did not concern him at all

chichagov one of the most zealous cuttersoff and breakersup who
had first wanted to effect a diversion in greece and then in warsaw but
never wished to go where he was sent chichagov noted for the boldness
with which he spoke to the emperor and who considered kutúzov to be
under an obligation to him because when he was sent to make peace with
turkey in  independently of kutúzov and found that peace had
already been concluded he admitted to the emperor that the merit of
securing that peace was really kutúzovs this chichagov was the first
to meet kutúzov at the castle where the latter was to stay in undress
naval uniform with a dirk and holding his cap under his arm he handed
kutúzov a garrison report and the keys of the town the contemptuously
respectful attitude of the younger men to the old man in his dotage was
expressed in the highest degree by the behavior of chichagov who knew
of the accusations that were being directed against kutúzov

when speaking to chichagov kutúzov incidentally mentioned that the
vehicles packed with china that had been captured from him at borísov
had been recovered and would be restored to him

you mean to imply that i have nothing to eat out of on the
contrary i can supply you with everything even if you want to give
dinner parties warmly replied chichagov who tried by every word he
spoke to prove his own rectitude and therefore imagined kutúzov to be
animated by the same desire

kutúzov shrugging his shoulders replied with his subtle penetrating
smile i meant merely to say what i said

contrary to the emperors wish kutúzov detained the greater part of the
army at vilna those about him said that he became extraordinarily slack
and physically feeble during his stay in that town he attended to army
affairs reluctantly left everything to his generals and while awaiting
the emperors arrival led a dissipated life

having left petersburg on the seventh of december with his suitecount
tolstóy prince volkonski arakcheev and othersthe emperor reached
vilna on the eleventh and in his traveling sleigh drove straight to the
castle in spite of the severe frost some hundred generals and staff
officers in full parade uniform stood in front of the castle as well as
a guard of honor of the semënov regiment

a courier who galloped to the castle in advance in a troyka with three
foamflecked horses shouted coming and konovnitsyn rushed into the
vestibule to inform kutúzov who was waiting in the hall porters little
lodge

a minute later the old mans large stout figure in fulldress uniform
his chest covered with orders and a scarf drawn round his stomach
waddled out into the porch he put on his hat with its peaks to the
sides and holding his gloves in his hand and walking with an effort
sideways down the steps to the level of the street took in his hand the
report he had prepared for the emperor

there was running to and fro and whispering another troyka flew
furiously up and then all eyes were turned on an approaching sleigh in
which the figures of the emperor and volkonski could already be
descried

from the habit of fifty years all this had a physically agitating effect
on the old general he carefully and hastily felt himself all over
readjusted his hat and pulling himself together drew himself up and at
the very moment when the emperor having alighted from the sleigh
lifted his eyes to him handed him the report and began speaking in his
smooth ingratiating voice

the emperor with a rapid glance scanned kutúzov from head to foot
frowned for an instant but immediately mastering himself went up to the
old man extended his arms and embraced him and this embrace too owing
to a longstanding impression related to his innermost feelings had its
usual effect on kutúzov and he gave a sob

the emperor greeted the officers and the semënov guard and again
pressing the old mans hand went with him into the castle

when alone with the field marshal the emperor expressed his
dissatisfaction at the slowness of the pursuit and at the mistakes made
at krasnoe and the berezina and informed him of his intentions for a
future campaign abroad kutúzov made no rejoinder or remark the same
submissive expressionless look with which he had listened to the
emperors commands on the field of austerlitz seven years before settled
on his face now

when kutúzov came out of the study and with lowered head was crossing
the ballroom with his heavy waddling gait he was arrested by someones
voice saying

your serene highness

kutúzov raised his head and looked for a long while into the eyes of
count tolstóy who stood before him holding a silver salver on which lay
a small object kutúzov seemed not to understand what was expected of
him

suddenly he seemed to remember a scarcely perceptible smile flashed
across his puffy face and bowing low and respectfully he took the
object that lay on the salver it was the order of st george of the
first class





chapter xi

next day the field marshal gave a dinner and ball which the emperor
honored by his presence kutúzov had received the order of st george of
the first class and the emperor showed him the highest honors but
everyone knew of the imperial dissatisfaction with him the proprieties
were observed and the emperor was the first to set that example but
everybody understood that the old man was blameworthy and goodfor
nothing when kutúzov conforming to a custom of catherines day
ordered the standards that had been captured to be lowered at the
emperors feet on his entering the ballroom the emperor made a wry face
and muttered something in which some people caught the words the old
comedian

the emperors displeasure with kutúzov was specially increased at vilna
by the fact that kutúzov evidently could not or would not understand the
importance of the coming campaign

when on the following morning the emperor said to the officers assembled
about him you have not only saved russia you have saved europe they
all understood that the war was not ended

kutúzov alone would not see this and openly expressed his opinion that
no fresh war could improve the position or add to the glory of russia
but could only spoil and lower the glorious position that russia had
gained he tried to prove to the emperor the impossibility of levying
fresh troops spoke of the hardships already endured by the people of
the possibility of failure and so forth

this being the field marshals frame of mind he was naturally regarded
as merely a hindrance and obstacle to the impending war

to avoid unpleasant encounters with the old man the natural method was
to do what had been done with him at austerlitz and with barclay at the
beginning of the russian campaignto transfer the authority to the
emperor himself thus cutting the ground from under the commander in
chiefs feet without upsetting the old man by informing him of the
change

with this object his staff was gradually reconstructed and its real
strength removed and transferred to the emperor toll konovnitsyn and
ermolov received fresh appointments everyone spoke loudly of the field
marshals great weakness and failing health

his health had to be bad for his place to be taken away and given to
another and in fact his health was poor

so naturally simply and graduallyjust as he had come from turkey to
the treasury in petersburg to recruit the militia and then to the army
when he was needed therenow when his part was played out kutúzovs
place was taken by a new and necessary performer

the war of  besides its national significance dear to every russian
heart was now to assume another a european significance

the movement of peoples from west to east was to be succeeded by a
movement of peoples from east to west and for this fresh war another
leader was necessary having qualities and views differing from
kutúzovs and animated by different motives

alexander i was as necessary for the movement of the peoples from east
to west and for the refixing of national frontiers as kutúzov had been
for the salvation and glory of russia

kutúzov did not understand what europe the balance of power or
napoleon meant he could not understand it for the representative of
the russian people after the enemy had been destroyed and russia had
been liberated and raised to the summit of her glory there was nothing
left to do as a russian nothing remained for the representative of the
national war but to die and kutúzov died





chapter xii

as generally happens pierre did not feel the full effects of the
physical privation and strain he had suffered as prisoner until after
they were over after his liberation he reached orel and on the third
day there when preparing to go to kiev he fell ill and was laid up for
three months he had what the doctors termed bilious fever but
despite the fact that the doctors treated him bled him and gave him
medicines to drink he recovered

scarcely any impression was left on pierres mind by all that happened
to him from the time of his rescue till his illness he remembered only
the dull gray weather now rainy and now snowy internal physical
distress and pains in his feet and side he remembered a general
impression of the misfortunes and sufferings of people and of being
worried by the curiosity of officers and generals who questioned him he
also remembered his difficulty in procuring a conveyance and horses and
above all he remembered his incapacity to think and feel all that time
on the day of his rescue he had seen the body of pétya rostóv that same
day he had learned that prince andrew after surviving the battle of
borodino for more than a month had recently died in the rostóvs house
at yaroslavl and denisov who told him this news also mentioned hélènes
death supposing that pierre had heard of it long before all this at
the time seemed merely strange to pierre he felt he could not grasp its
significance just then he was only anxious to get away as quickly as
possible from places where people were killing one another to some
peaceful refuge where he could recover himself rest and think over all
the strange new facts he had learned but on reaching orel he
immediately fell ill when he came to himself after his illness he saw
in attendance on him two of his servants terenty and vaska who had
come from moscow and also his cousin the eldest princess who had been
living on his estate at elets and hearing of his rescue and illness had
come to look after him

it was only gradually during his convalescence that pierre lost the
impressions he had become accustomed to during the last few months and
got used to the idea that no one would oblige him to go anywhere
tomorrow that no one would deprive him of his warm bed and that he
would be sure to get his dinner tea and supper but for a long time in
his dreams he still saw himself in the conditions of captivity in the
same way little by little he came to understand the news he had been
told after his rescue about the death of prince andrew the death of
his wife and the destruction of the french

a joyous feeling of freedomthat complete inalienable freedom natural to
man which he had first experienced at the first halt outside
moscowfilled pierres soul during his convalescence he was surprised
to find that this inner freedom which was independent of external
conditions now had as it were an additional setting of external
liberty he was alone in a strange town without acquaintances no one
demanded anything of him or sent him anywhere he had all he wanted the
thought of his wife which had been a continual torment to him was no
longer there since she was no more

oh how good how splendid said he to himself when a cleanly laid
table was moved up to him with savory beef tea or when he lay down for
the night on a soft clean bed or when he remembered that the french had
gone and that his wife was no more oh how good how splendid

and by old habit he asked himself the question well and what then
what am i going to do and he immediately gave himself the answer
well i shall live ah how splendid

the very question that had formerly tormented him the thing he had
continually sought to findthe aim of lifeno longer existed for him
now that search for the aim of life had not merely disappeared
temporarilyhe felt that it no longer existed for him and could not
present itself again and this very absence of an aim gave him the
complete joyous sense of freedom which constituted his happiness at
this time

he could not see an aim for he now had faithnot faith in any kind of
rule or words or ideas but faith in an everliving evermanifest
god formerly he had sought him in aims he set himself that search for
an aim had been simply a search for god and suddenly in his captivity
he had learned not by words or reasoning but by direct feeling what his
nurse had told him long ago that god is here and everywhere in his
captivity he had learned that in karataev god was greater more infinite
and unfathomable than in the architect of the universe recognized by the
freemasons he felt like a man who after straining his eyes to see into
the far distance finds what he sought at his very feet all his life he
had looked over the heads of the men around him when he should have
merely looked in front of him without straining his eyes

in the past he had never been able to find that great inscrutable
infinite something he had only felt that it must exist somewhere and
had looked for it in everything near and comprehensible he had only
what was limited petty commonplace and senseless he had equipped
himself with a mental telescope and looked into remote space where
petty worldliness hiding itself in misty distance had seemed to him
great and infinite merely because it was not clearly seen and such had
european life politics freemasonry philosophy and philanthropy
seemed to him but even then at moments of weakness as he had accounted
them his mind had penetrated to those distances and he had there seen
the same pettiness worldliness and senselessness now however he had
learned to see the great eternal and infinite in everything and
thereforeto see it and enjoy its contemplationhe naturally threw away
the telescope through which he had till now gazed over mens heads and
gladly regarded the everchanging eternally great unfathomable and
infinite life around him and the closer he looked the more tranquil and
happy he became that dreadful question what for which had formerly
destroyed all his mental edifices no longer existed for him to that
question what for a simple answer was now always ready in his soul
because there is a god that god without whose will not one hair falls
from a mans head





chapter xiii

in external ways pierre had hardly changed at all in appearance he was
just what he used to be as before he was absentminded and seemed
occupied not with what was before his eyes but with something special of
his own the difference between his former and present self was that
formerly when he did not grasp what lay before him or was said to him
he had puckered his forehead painfully as if vainly seeking to
distinguish something at a distance at present he still forgot what was
said to him and still did not see what was before his eyes but he now
looked with a scarcely perceptible and seemingly ironic smile at what
was before him and listened to what was said though evidently seeing
and hearing something quite different formerly he had appeared to be a
kindhearted but unhappy man and so people had been inclined to avoid
him now a smile at the joy of life always played round his lips and
sympathy for others shone in his eyes with a questioning look as to
whether they were as contented as he was and people felt pleased by his
presence

previously he had talked a great deal grew excited when he talked and
seldom listened now he was seldom carried away in conversation and knew
how to listen so that people readily told him their most intimate
secrets

the princess who had never liked pierre and had been particularly
hostile to him since she had felt herself under obligations to him after
the old counts death now after staying a short time in orelwhere she
had come intending to show pierre that in spite of his ingratitude she
considered it her duty to nurse himfelt to her surprise and vexation
that she had become fond of him pierre did not in any way seek her
approval he merely studied her with interest formerly she had felt
that he regarded her with indifference and irony and so had shrunk into
herself as she did with others and had shown him only the combative side
of her nature but now he seemed to be trying to understand the most
intimate places of her heart and mistrustfully at first but afterwards
gratefully she let him see the hidden kindly sides of her character

the most cunning man could not have crept into her confidence more
successfully evoking memories of the best times of her youth and
showing sympathy with them yet pierres cunning consisted simply in
finding pleasure in drawing out the human qualities of the embittered
hard and in her own way proud princess

yes he is a very very kind man when he is not under the influence of
bad people but of people such as myself thought she

his servants tooterenty and vaskain their own way noticed the change
that had taken place in pierre they considered that he had become much
simpler terenty when he had helped him undress and wished him good
night often lingered with his masters boots in his hands and clothes
over his arm to see whether he would not start a talk and pierre
noticing that terenty wanted a chat generally kept him there

well tell me now how did you get food he would ask

and terenty would begin talking of the destruction of moscow and of the
old count and would stand for a long time holding the clothes and
talking or sometimes listening to pierres stories and then would go
out into the hall with a pleasant sense of intimacy with his master and
affection for him

the doctor who attended pierre and visited him every day though he
considered it his duty as a doctor to pose as a man whose every moment
was of value to suffering humanity would sit for hours with pierre
telling him his favorite anecdotes and his observations on the
characters of his patients in general and especially of the ladies

its a pleasure to talk to a man like that he is not like our
provincials he would say

there were several prisoners from the french army in orel and the
doctor brought one of them a young italian to see pierre

this officer began visiting pierre and the princess used to make fun of
the tenderness the italian expressed for him

the italian seemed happy only when he could come to see pierre talk
with him tell him about his past his life at home and his love and
pour out to him his indignation against the french and especially
against napoleon

if all russians are in the least like you it is sacrilege to fight
such a nation he said to pierre you who have suffered so from the
french do not even feel animosity toward them

pierre had evoked the passionate affection of the italian merely by
evoking the best side of his nature and taking a pleasure in so doing

during the last days of pierres stay in orel his old masonic
acquaintance count willarski who had introduced him to the lodge in
 came to see him willarski was married to a russian heiress who
had a large estate in orel province and he occupied a temporary post in
the commissariat department in that town

hearing that bezúkhov was in orel willarski though they had never been
intimate came to him with the professions of friendship and intimacy
that people who meet in a desert generally express for one another
willarski felt dull in orel and was pleased to meet a man of his own
circle and as he supposed of similar interests

but to his surprise willarski soon noticed that pierre had lagged much
behind the times and had sunk as he expressed it to himself into
apathy and egotism

you are letting yourself go my dear fellow he said

but for all that willarski found it pleasanter now than it had been
formerly to be with pierre and came to see him every day to pierre as
he looked at and listened to willarski it seemed strange to think that
he had been like that himself but a short time before

willarski was a married man with a family busy with his family affairs
his wifes affairs and his official duties he regarded all these
occupations as hindrances to life and considered that they were all
contemptible because their aim was the welfare of himself and his
family military administrative political and masonic interests
continually absorbed his attention and pierre without trying to change
the others views and without condemning him but with the quiet
joyful and amused smile now habitual to him was interested in this
strange though very familiar phenomenon

there was a new feature in pierres relations with willarski with the
princess with the doctor and with all the people he now met which
gained for him the general good will this was his acknowledgment of the
impossibility of changing a mans convictions by words and his
recognition of the possibility of everyone thinking feeling and seeing
things each from his own point of view this legitimate peculiarity of
each individual which used to excite and irritate pierre now became a
basis of the sympathy he felt for and the interest he took in other
people the difference and sometimes complete contradiction between
mens opinions and their lives and between one man and another pleased
him and drew from him an amused and gentle smile

in practical matters pierre unexpectedly felt within himself a center of
gravity he had previously lacked formerly all pecuniary questions
especially requests for money to which as an extremely wealthy man he
was very exposed produced in him a state of hopeless agitation and
perplexity to give or not to give he had asked himself i have it
and he needs it but someone else needs it still more who needs it
most and perhaps they are both impostors in the old days he had been
unable to find a way out of all these surmises and had given to all who
asked as long as he had anything to give formerly he had been in a
similar state of perplexity with regard to every question concerning his
property when one person advised one thing and another something else

now to his surprise he found that he no longer felt either doubt or
perplexity about these questions there was now within him a judge who
by some rule unknown to him decided what should or should not be done

he was as indifferent as heretofore to money matters but now he felt
certain of what ought and what ought not to be done the first time he
had recourse to his new judge was when a french prisoner a colonel
came to him and after talking a great deal about his exploits
concluded by making what amounted to a demand that pierre should give
him four thousand francs to send to his wife and children pierre
refused without the least difficulty or effort and was afterwards
surprised how simple and easy had been what used to appear so
insurmountably difficult at the same time that he refused the colonels
demand he made up his mind that he must have recourse to artifice when
leaving orel to induce the italian officer to accept some money of
which he was evidently in need a further proof to pierre of his own
more settled outlook on practical matters was furnished by his decision
with regard to his wifes debts and to the rebuilding of his houses in
and near moscow

his head steward came to him at orel and pierre reckoned up with him his
diminished income the burning of moscow had cost him according to the
head stewards calculation about two million rubles

to console pierre for these losses the head steward gave him an estimate
showing that despite these losses his income would not be diminished but
would even be increased if he refused to pay his wifes debts which he
was under no obligation to meet and did not rebuild his moscow house
and the country house on his moscow estate which had cost him eighty
thousand rubles a year and brought in nothing

yes of course thats true said pierre with a cheerful smile i
dont need all that at all by being ruined i have become much richer

but in january savelich came from moscow and gave him an account of the
state of things there and spoke of the estimate an architect had made
of the cost of rebuilding the town and country houses speaking of this
as of a settled matter about the same time he received letters from
prince vasíli and other petersburg acquaintances speaking of his wifes
debts and pierre decided that the stewards proposals which had so
pleased him were wrong and that he must go to petersburg and settle his
wifes affairs and must rebuild in moscow why this was necessary he did
not know but he knew for certain that it was necessary his income
would be reduced by three fourths but he felt it must be done

willarski was going to moscow and they agreed to travel together

during the whole time of his convalescence in orel pierre had
experienced a feeling of joy freedom and life but when during his
journey he found himself in the open world and saw hundreds of new
faces that feeling was intensified throughout his journey he felt like
a schoolboy on holiday everyonethe stagecoach driver the posthouse
overseers the peasants on the roads and in the villageshad a new
significance for him the presence and remarks of willarski who
continually deplored the ignorance and poverty of russia and its
backwardness compared with europe only heightened pierres pleasure
where willarski saw deadness pierre saw an extraordinary strength and
vitalitythe strength which in that vast space amid the snows maintained
the life of this original peculiar and unique people he did not
contradict willarski and even seemed to agree with himan apparent
agreement being the simplest way to avoid discussions that could lead to
nothingand he smiled joyfully as he listened to him





chapter xiv

it would be difficult to explain why and whither ants whose heap has
been destroyed are hurrying some from the heap dragging bits of
rubbish larvae and corpses others back to the heap or why they
jostle overtake one another and fight and it would be equally
difficult to explain what caused the russians after the departure of the
french to throng to the place that had formerly been moscow but when we
watch the ants round their ruined heap the tenacity energy and
immense number of the delving insects prove that despite the destruction
of the heap something indestructible which though intangible is the
real strength of the colony still exists and similarly though in
moscow in the month of october there was no government and no churches
shrines riches or housesit was still the moscow it had been in
august all was destroyed except something intangible yet powerful and
indestructible

the motives of those who thronged from all sides to moscow after it had
been cleared of the enemy were most diverse and personal and at first
for the most part savage and brutal one motive only they all had in
common a desire to get to the place that had been called moscow to
apply their activities there

within a week moscow already had fifteen thousand inhabitants in a
fortnight twentyfive thousand and so on by the autumn of  the
number ever increasing and increasing exceeded what it had been in


the first russians to enter moscow were the cossacks of wintzingerodes
detachment peasants from the adjacent villages and residents who had
fled from moscow and had been hiding in its vicinity the russians who
entered moscow finding it plundered plundered it in their turn they
continued what the french had begun trains of peasant carts came to
moscow to carry off to the villages what had been abandoned in the
ruined houses and the streets the cossacks carried off what they could
to their camps and the householders seized all they could find in other
houses and moved it to their own pretending that it was their property

but the first plunderers were followed by a second and a third
contingent and with increasing numbers plundering became more and more
difficult and assumed more definite forms

the french found moscow abandoned but with all the organizations of
regular life with diverse branches of commerce and craftsmanship with
luxury and governmental and religious institutions these forms were
lifeless but still existed there were bazaars shops warehouses
market stalls granariesfor the most part still stocked with goodsand
there were factories and workshops palaces and wealthy houses filled
with luxuries hospitals prisons government offices churches and
cathedrals the longer the french remained the more these forms of town
life perished until finally all was merged into one confused lifeless
scene of plunder

the more the plundering by the french continued the more both the
wealth of moscow and the strength of its plunderers was destroyed but
plundering by the russians with which the reoccupation of the city
began had an opposite effect the longer it continued and the greater
the number of people taking part in it the more rapidly was the wealth
of the city and its regular life restored

besides the plunderers very various people some drawn by curiosity
some by official duties some by selfinteresthouse owners clergy
officials of all kinds tradesmen artisans and peasantsstreamed into
moscow as blood flows to the heart

within a week the peasants who came with empty carts to carry off
plunder were stopped by the authorities and made to cart the corpses out
of the town other peasants having heard of their comrades
discomfiture came to town bringing rye oats and hay and beat down
one anothers prices to below what they had been in former days gangs
of carpenters hoping for high pay arrived in moscow every day and on
all sides logs were being hewn new houses built and old charred ones
repaired tradesmen began trading in booths cookshops and taverns were
opened in partially burned houses the clergy resumed the services in
many churches that had not been burned donors contributed church
property that had been stolen government clerks set up their baize
covered tables and their pigeonholes of documents in small rooms the
higher authorities and the police organized the distribution of goods
left behind by the french the owners of houses in which much property
had been left brought there from other houses complained of the
injustice of taking everything to the faceted palace in the kremlin
others insisted that as the french had gathered things from different
houses into this or that house it would be unfair to allow its owner to
keep all that was found there they abused the police and bribed them
made out estimates at ten times their value for government stores that
had perished in the fire and demanded relief and count rostopchin
wrote proclamations





chapter xv

at the end of january pierre went to moscow and stayed in an annex of
his house which had not been burned he called on count rostopchin and
on some acquaintances who were back in moscow and he intended to leave
for petersburg two days later everybody was celebrating the victory
everything was bubbling with life in the ruined but reviving city
everyone was pleased to see pierre everyone wished to meet him and
everyone questioned him about what he had seen pierre felt particularly
well disposed toward them all but was now instinctively on his guard
for fear of binding himself in any way to all questions put to
himwhether important or quite triflingsuch as where would he live
was he going to rebuild when was he going to petersburg and would he
mind taking a parcel for someonehe replied yes perhaps or i
think so and so on

he had heard that the rostóvs were at kostroma but the thought of
natásha seldom occurred to him if it did it was only as a pleasant
memory of the distant past he felt himself not only free from social
obligations but also from that feeling which it seemed to him he had
aroused in himself

on the third day after his arrival he heard from the drubetskóys that
princess mary was in moscow the death sufferings and last days of
prince andrew had often occupied pierres thoughts and now recurred to
him with fresh vividness having heard at dinner that princess mary was
in moscow and living in her housewhich had not been burnedin
vozdvizhenka street he drove that same evening to see her

on his way to the house pierre kept thinking of prince andrew of their
friendship of his various meetings with him and especially of the last
one at borodino

is it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then in
is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him before
he died thought pierre he recalled karataev and his death and
involuntarily began to compare these two men so different and yet so
similar in that they had both lived and both died and in the love he
felt for both of them

pierre drove up to the house of the old prince in a most serious mood
the house had escaped the fire it showed signs of damage but its
general aspect was unchanged the old footman who met pierre with a
stern face as if wishing to make the visitor feel that the absence of
the old prince had not disturbed the order of things in the house
informed him that the princess had gone to her own apartments and that
she received on sundays

announce me perhaps she will see me said pierre

yes sir said the man please step into the portrait gallery

a few minutes later the footman returned with dessalles who brought
word from the princess that she would be very glad to see pierre if he
would excuse her want of ceremony and come upstairs to her apartment

in a rather low room lit by one candle sat the princess and with her
another person dressed in black pierre remembered that the princess
always had lady companions but who they were and what they were like he
never knew or remembered this must be one of her companions he
thought glancing at the lady in the black dress

the princess rose quickly to meet him and held out her hand

yes she said looking at his altered face after he had kissed her
hand so this is how we meet again he spoke of you even at the very
last she went on turning her eyes from pierre to her companion with a
shyness that surprised him for an instant

i was so glad to hear of your safety it was the first piece of good
news we had received for a long time

again the princess glanced round at her companion with even more
uneasiness in her manner and was about to add something but pierre
interrupted her

just imaginei knew nothing about him said he i thought he had been
killed all i know i heard at second hand from others i only know that
he fell in with the rostóvs what a strange coincidence

pierre spoke rapidly and with animation he glanced once at the
companions face saw her attentive and kindly gaze fixed on him and
as often happens when one is talking felt somehow that this companion
in the black dress was a good kind excellent creature who would not
hinder his conversing freely with princess mary

but when he mentioned the rostóvs princess marys face expressed still
greater embarrassment she again glanced rapidly from pierres face to
that of the lady in the black dress and said

do you really not recognize her

pierre looked again at the companions pale delicate face with its
black eyes and peculiar mouth and something near to him long forgotten
and more than sweet looked at him from those attentive eyes

but no it cant be he thought this stern thin pale face that
looks so much older it cannot be she it merely reminds me of her but
at that moment princess mary said natásha and with difficulty
effort and stress like the opening of a door grown rusty on its
hinges a smile appeared on the face with the attentive eyes and from
that opening door came a breath of fragrance which suffused pierre with
a happiness he had long forgotten and of which he had not even been
thinkingespecially at that moment it suffused him seized him and
enveloped him completely when she smiled doubt was no longer possible
it was natásha and he loved her

at that moment pierre involuntarily betrayed to her to princess mary
and above all to himself a secret of which he himself had been unaware
he flushed joyfully yet with painful distress he tried to hide his
agitation but the more he tried to hide it the more clearlyclearer
than any words could have donedid he betray to himself to her and to
princess mary that he loved her

no its only the unexpectedness of it thought pierre but as soon as
he tried to continue the conversation he had begun with princess mary he
again glanced at natásha and a stilldeeper flush suffused his face and
a stillstronger agitation of mingled joy and fear seized his soul he
became confused in his speech and stopped in the middle of what he was
saying

pierre had failed to notice natásha because he did not at all expect to
see her there but he had failed to recognize her because the change in
her since he last saw her was immense she had grown thin and pale but
that was not what made her unrecognizable she was unrecognizable at the
moment he entered because on that face whose eyes had always shone with
a suppressed smile of the joy of life now when he first entered and
glanced at her there was not the least shadow of a smile only her eyes
were kindly attentive and sadly interrogative

pierres confusion was not reflected by any confusion on natáshas part
but only by the pleasure that just perceptibly lit up her whole face





chapter xvi

she has come to stay with me said princess mary the count and
countess will be here in a few days the countess is in a dreadful
state but it was necessary for natásha herself to see a doctor they
insisted on her coming with me

yes is there a family free from sorrow now said pierre addressing
natásha you know it happened the very day we were rescued i saw him
what a delightful boy he was

natásha looked at him and by way of answer to his words her eyes
widened and lit up

what can one say or think of as a consolation said pierre nothing
why had such a splendid boy so full of life to die

yes in these days it would be hard to live without faith remarked
princess mary

yes yes that is really true pierre hastily interrupted her

why is it true natásha asked looking attentively into pierres eyes

how can you ask why said princess mary the thought alone of what
awaits

natásha without waiting for princess mary to finish again looked
inquiringly at pierre

and because pierre continued only one who believes that there is a
god ruling us can bear a loss such as hers and yours

natásha had already opened her mouth to speak but suddenly stopped
pierre hurriedly turned away from her and again addressed princess mary
asking about his friends last days

pierres confusion had now almost vanished but at the same time he felt
that his freedom had also completely gone he felt that there was now a
judge of his every word and action whose judgment mattered more to him
than that of all the rest of the world as he spoke now he was
considering what impression his words would make on natásha he did not
purposely say things to please her but whatever he was saying he
regarded from her standpoint

princess maryreluctantly as is usual in such casesbegan telling of the
condition in which she had found prince andrew but pierres face
quivering with emotion his questions and his eager restless expression
gradually compelled her to go into details which she feared to recall
for her own sake

yes yes and so pierre kept saying as he leaned toward her with
his whole body and eagerly listened to her story yes yes so he
grew tranquil and softened with all his soul he had always sought one
thingto be perfectly goodso he could not be afraid of death the
faults he hadif he had anywere not of his making so he did soften
what a happy thing that he saw you again he added suddenly turning to
natásha and looking at her with eyes full of tears

natáshas face twitched she frowned and lowered her eyes for a moment
she hesitated for an instant whether to speak or not

yes that was happiness she then said in her quiet voice with its
deep chest notes for me it certainly was happiness she paused and
he he he said he was wishing for it at the very moment i entered
the room

natáshas voice broke she blushed pressed her clasped hands on her
knees and then controlling herself with an evident effort lifted her
head and began to speak rapidly

we knew nothing of it when we started from moscow i did not dare to
ask about him then suddenly sónya told me he was traveling with us i
had no idea and could not imagine what state he was in all i wanted was
to see him and be with him she said trembling and breathing quickly

and not letting them interrupt her she went on to tell what she had
never yet mentioned to anyoneall she had lived through during those
three weeks of their journey and life at yaroslavl

pierre listened to her with lips parted and eyes fixed upon her full of
tears as he listened he did not think of prince andrew nor of death
nor of what she was telling he listened to her and felt only pity for
her for what she was suffering now while she was speaking

princess mary frowning in her effort to hold back her tears sat beside
natásha and heard for the first time the story of those last days of
her brothers and natáshas love

evidently natásha needed to tell that painful yet joyful tale

she spoke mingling most trifling details with the intimate secrets of
her soul and it seemed as if she could never finish several times she
repeated the same thing twice

dessalles voice was heard outside the door asking whether little
nicholas might come in to say good night

well thats alleverything said natásha

she got up quickly just as nicholas entered almost ran to the door
which was hidden by curtains struck her head against it and rushed
from the room with a moan either of pain or sorrow

pierre gazed at the door through which she had disappeared and did not
understand why he suddenly felt all alone in the world

princess mary roused him from his abstraction by drawing his attention
to her nephew who had entered the room

at that moment of emotional tenderness young nicholas face which
resembled his fathers affected pierre so much that when he had kissed
the boy he got up quickly took out his handkerchief and went to the
window he wished to take leave of princess mary but she would not let
him go

no natásha and i sometimes dont go to sleep till after two so please
dont go i will order supper go downstairs we will come immediately

before pierre left the room princess mary told him this is the first
time she has talked of him like that





chapter xvii

pierre was shown into the large brightly lit dining room a few minutes
later he heard footsteps and princess mary entered with natásha natásha
was calm though a severe and grave expression had again settled on her
face they all three of them now experienced that feeling of awkwardness
which usually follows after a serious and heartfelt talk it is
impossible to go back to the same conversation to talk of trifles is
awkward and yet the desire to speak is there and silence seems like
affectation they went silently to table the footmen drew back the
chairs and pushed them up again pierre unfolded his cold table napkin
and resolving to break the silence looked at natásha and at princess
mary they had evidently both formed the same resolution the eyes of
both shone with satisfaction and a confession that besides sorrow life
also has joy

do you take vodka count asked princess mary and those words
suddenly banished the shadows of the past now tell us about yourself
said she one hears such improbable wonders about you

yes replied pierre with the smile of mild irony now habitual to him
they even tell me wonders i myself never dreamed of mary abramovna
invited me to her house and kept telling me what had happened or ought
to have happened to me stepan stepanych also instructed me how i ought
to tell of my experiences in general i have noticed that it is very
easy to be an interesting man i am an interesting man now people
invite me out and tell me all about myself

natásha smiled and was on the point of speaking

we have been told princess mary interrupted her that you lost two
millions in moscow is that true

but i am three times as rich as before returned pierre

though the position was now altered by his decision to pay his wifes
debts and to rebuild his houses pierre still maintained that he had
become three times as rich as before

what i have certainly gained is freedom he began seriously but did
not continue noticing that this theme was too egotistic

and are you building

yes savelich says i must

tell me you did not know of the countess death when you decided to
remain in moscow asked princess mary and immediately blushed noticing
that her question following his mention of freedom ascribed to his
words a meaning he had perhaps not intended

no answered pierre evidently not considering awkward the meaning
princess mary had given to his words i heard of it in orel and you
cannot imagine how it shocked me we were not an exemplary couple he
added quickly glancing at natásha and noticing on her face curiosity as
to how he would speak of his wife but her death shocked me terribly
when two people quarrel they are always both in fault and ones own
guilt suddenly becomes terribly serious when the other is no longer
alive and then such a death without friends and without consolation
i am very very sorry for her he concluded and was pleased to notice
a look of glad approval on natáshas face

yes and so you are once more an eligible bachelor said princess
mary

pierre suddenly flushed crimson and for a long time tried not to look at
natásha when he ventured to glance her way again her face was cold
stern and he fancied even contemptuous

and did you really see and speak to napoleon as we have been told
said princess mary

pierre laughed

no not once everybody seems to imagine that being taken prisoner
means being napoleons guest not only did i never see him but i heard
nothing about himi was in much lower company

supper was over and pierre who at first declined to speak about his
captivity was gradually led on to do so

but its true that you remained in moscow to kill napoleon natásha
asked with a slight smile i guessed it then when we met at the
sukharev tower do you remember

pierre admitted that it was true and from that was gradually led by
princess marys questions and especially by natáshas into giving a
detailed account of his adventures

at first he spoke with the amused and mild irony now customary with him
toward everybody and especially toward himself but when he came to
describe the horrors and sufferings he had witnessed he was
unconsciously carried away and began speaking with the suppressed
emotion of a man reexperiencing in recollection strong impressions he
has lived through

princess mary with a gentle smile looked now at pierre and now at
natásha in the whole narrative she saw only pierre and his goodness
natásha leaning on her elbow the expression of her face constantly
changing with the narrative watched pierre with an attention that never
wanderedevidently herself experiencing all that he described not only
her look but her exclamations and the brief questions she put showed
pierre that she understood just what he wished to convey it was clear
that she understood not only what he said but also what he wished to
but could not express in words the account pierre gave of the incident
with the child and the woman for protecting whom he was arrested was
this it was an awful sightchildren abandoned some in the flames
one was snatched out before my eyes and there were women who had
their things snatched off and their earrings torn out he flushed and
grew confused then a patrol arrived and all the menall those who were
not looting that iswere arrested and i among them

i am sure youre not telling us everything i am sure you did
something said natásha and pausing added something fine

pierre continued when he spoke of the execution he wanted to pass over
the horrible details but natásha insisted that he should not omit
anything

pierre began to tell about karataev but paused by this time he had
risen from the table and was pacing the room natásha following him with
her eyes then he added

no you cant understand what i learned from that illiterate manthat
simple fellow

yes yes go on said natásha where is he

they killed him almost before my eyes

and pierre his voice trembling continually went on to tell of the last
days of their retreat of karataevs illness and his death

he told of his adventures as he had never yet recalled them he now as
it were saw a new meaning in all he had gone through now that he was
telling it all to natásha he experienced that pleasure which a man has
when women listen to himnot clever women who when listening either try
to remember what they hear to enrich their minds and when opportunity
offers to retell it or who wish to adopt it to some thought of their
own and promptly contribute their own clever comments prepared in their
little mental workshopbut the pleasure given by real women gifted with
a capacity to select and absorb the very best a man shows of himself
natásha without knowing it was all attention she did not lose a word
no single quiver in pierres voice no look no twitch of a muscle in
his face nor a single gesture she caught the unfinished word in its
flight and took it straight into her open heart divining the secret
meaning of all pierres mental travail

princess mary understood his story and sympathized with him but she now
saw something else that absorbed all her attention she saw the
possibility of love and happiness between natásha and pierre and the
first thought of this filled her heart with gladness

it was three oclock in the morning the footmen came in with sad and
stern faces to change the candles but no one noticed them

pierre finished his story natásha continued to look at him intently
with bright attentive and animated eyes as if trying to understand
something more which he had perhaps left untold pierre in shamefaced
and happy confusion glanced occasionally at her and tried to think what
to say next to introduce a fresh subject princess mary was silent it
occurred to none of them that it was three oclock and time to go to
bed

people speak of misfortunes and sufferings remarked pierre but if
at this moment i were asked would you rather be what you were before
you were taken prisoner or go through all this again then for
heavens sake let me again have captivity and horseflesh we imagine
that when we are thrown out of our usual ruts all is lost but it is
only then that what is new and good begins while there is life there is
happiness there is much much before us i say this to you he added
turning to natásha

yes yes she said answering something quite different i too should
wish nothing but to relive it all from the beginning

pierre looked intently at her

yes and nothing more said natásha

its not true not true cried pierre i am not to blame for being
alive and wishing to livenor you either

suddenly natásha bent her head covered her face with her hands and
began to cry

what is it natásha said princess mary

nothing nothing she smiled at pierre through her tears good night
it is time for bed

pierre rose and took his leave

princess mary and natásha met as usual in the bedroom they talked of
what pierre had told them princess mary did not express her opinion of
pierre nor did natásha speak of him

well good night mary said natásha do you know i am often afraid
that by not speaking of him she meant prince andrew for fear of not
doing justice to our feelings we forget him

princess mary sighed deeply and thereby acknowledged the justice of
natáshas remark but she did not express agreement in words

is it possible to forget said she

it did me so much good to tell all about it today it was hard and
painful but good very good said natásha i am sure he really loved
him that is why i told him was it all right she added suddenly
blushing

to tell pierre oh yes what a splendid man he is said princess
mary

do you know mary natásha suddenly said with a mischievous smile
such as princess mary had not seen on her face for a long time he has
somehow grown so clean smooth and freshas if he had just come out of
a russian bath do you understand out of a moral bath isnt it true

yes replied princess mary he has greatly improved

with a short coat and his hair cropped just as if well just as if he
had come straight from the bath papa used to

i understand why he prince andrew liked no one so much as him
said princess mary

yes and yet he is quite different they say men are friends when they
are quite different that must be true really he is quite unlike himin
everything

yes but hes wonderful

well good night said natásha

and the same mischievous smile lingered for a long time on her face as
if it had been forgotten there





chapter xviii

it was a long time before pierre could fall asleep that night he paced
up and down his room now turning his thoughts on a difficult problem
and frowning now suddenly shrugging his shoulders and wincing and now
smiling happily

he was thinking of prince andrew of natásha and of their love at one
moment jealous of her past then reproaching himself for that feeling
it was already six in the morning and he still paced up and down the
room

well whats to be done if it cannot be avoided whats to be done
evidently it has to be so said he to himself and hastily undressing
he got into bed happy and agitated but free from hesitation or
indecision

strange and impossible as such happiness seems i must do everything
that she and i may be man and wife he told himself

a few days previously pierre had decided to go to petersburg on the
friday when he awoke on the thursday savelich came to ask him about
packing for the journey

what to petersburg what is petersburg who is there in petersburg
he asked involuntarily though only to himself oh yes long ago
before this happened i did for some reason mean to go to petersburg he
reflected why but perhaps i shall go what a good fellow he is and
how attentive and how he remembers everything he thought looking at
savelichs old face and what a pleasant smile he has

well savelich do you still not wish to accept your freedom pierre
asked him

whats the good of freedom to me your excellency we lived under the
late countthe kingdom of heaven be hisand we have lived under you
too without ever being wronged

and your children

the children will live just the same with such masters one can live

but what about my heirs said pierre supposing i suddenly marry
it might happen he added with an involuntary smile

if i may take the liberty your excellency it would be a good thing

how easy he thinks it thought pierre he doesnt know how terrible
it is and how dangerous too soon or too late it is terrible

so what are your orders are you starting tomorrow asked savelich

no ill put it off for a bit ill tell you later you must forgive
the trouble i have put you to said pierre and seeing savelich smile
he thought but how strange it is that he should not know that now
there is no petersburg for me and that that must be settled first of
all but probably he knows it well enough and is only pretending shall
i have a talk with him and see what he thinks pierre reflected no
another time

at breakfast pierre told the princess his cousin that he had been to
see princess mary the day before and had there metwhom do you think
natásha rostóva

the princess seemed to see nothing more extraordinary in that than if he
had seen anna semënovna

do you know her asked pierre

i have seen the princess she replied i heard that they were
arranging a match for her with young rostóv it would be a very good
thing for the rostóvs they are said to be utterly ruined

no i mean do you know natásha rostóva

i heard about that affair of hers at the time it was a great pity

no she either doesnt understand or is pretending thought pierre
better not say anything to her either

the princess too had prepared provisions for pierres journey

how kind they all are thought pierre what is surprising is that
they should trouble about these things now when it can no longer be of
interest to them and all for me

on the same day the chief of police came to pierre inviting him to send
a representative to the faceted palace to recover things that were to be
returned to their owners that day

and this man too thought pierre looking into the face of the chief
of police what a fine goodlooking officer and how kind fancy
bothering about such trifles now and they actually say he is not honest
and takes bribes what nonsense besides why shouldnt he take bribes
thats the way he was brought up and everybody does it but what a
kind pleasant face and how he smiles as he looks at me

pierre went to princess marys to dinner

as he drove through the streets past the houses that had been burned
down he was surprised by the beauty of those ruins the picturesqueness
of the chimney stacks and tumbledown walls of the burnedout quarters
of the town stretching out and concealing one another reminded him of
the rhine and the colosseum the cabmen he met and their passengers the
carpenters cutting the timber for new houses with axes the women
hawkers and the shopkeepers all looked at him with cheerful beaming
eyes that seemed to say ah there he is lets see what will come of
it

at the entrance to princess marys house pierre felt doubtful whether he
had really been there the night before and really seen natásha and
talked to her perhaps i imagined it perhaps i shall go in and find no
one there but he had hardly entered the room before he felt her
presence with his whole being by the loss of his sense of freedom she
was in the same black dress with soft folds and her hair was done the
same way as the day before yet she was quite different had she been
like this when he entered the day before he could not for a moment have
failed to recognize her

she was as he had known her almost as a child and later on as prince
andrews fiancee a bright questioning light shone in her eyes and on
her face was a friendly and strangely roguish expression

pierre dined with them and would have spent the whole evening there but
princess mary was going to vespers and pierre left the house with her

next day he came early dined and stayed the whole evening though
princess mary and natásha were evidently glad to see their visitor and
though all pierres interest was now centered in that house by the
evening they had talked over everything and the conversation passed from
one trivial topic to another and repeatedly broke off he stayed so long
that princess mary and natásha exchanged glances evidently wondering
when he would go pierre noticed this but could not go he felt uneasy
and embarrassed but sat on because he simply could not get up and take
his leave

princess mary foreseeing no end to this rose first and complaining of
a headache began to say good night

so you are going to petersburg tomorrow she asked

no i am not going pierre replied hastily in a surprised tone and as
though offended yes no to petersburg tomorrowbut i wont say
goodby yet i will call round in case you have any commissions for me
said he standing before princess mary and turning red but not taking
his departure

natásha gave him her hand and went out princess mary on the other hand
instead of going away sank into an armchair and looked sternly and
intently at him with her deep radiant eyes the weariness she had
plainly shown before had now quite passed off with a deep and long
drawn sigh she seemed to be prepared for a lengthy talk

when natásha left the room pierres confusion and awkwardness
immediately vanished and were replaced by eager excitement he quickly
moved an armchair toward princess mary

yes i wanted to tell you said he answering her look as if she had
spoken princess help me what am i to do can i hope princess my
dear friend listen i know it all i know i am not worthy of her i
know its impossible to speak of it now but i want to be a brother to
her no not that i dont i cant

he paused and rubbed his face and eyes with his hands

well he went on with an evident effort at selfcontrol and coherence
i dont know when i began to love her but i have loved her and her
alone all my life and i love her so that i cannot imagine life without
her i cannot propose to her at present but the thought that perhaps
she might someday be my wife and that i may be missing that
possibility that possibility is terrible tell me can i hope
tell me what i am to do dear princess he added after a pause and
touched her hand as she did not reply

i am thinking of what you have told me answered princess mary this
is what i will say you are right that to speak to her of love at
present

princess mary stopped she was going to say that to speak of love was
impossible but she stopped because she had seen by the sudden change in
natásha two days before that she would not only not be hurt if pierre
spoke of his love but that it was the very thing she wished for

to speak to her now wouldnt do said the princess all the same

but what am i to do

leave it to me said princess mary i know

pierre was looking into princess marys eyes

well well he said

i know that she loves will love you princess mary corrected
herself

before her words were out pierre had sprung up and with a frightened
expression seized princess marys hand

what makes you think so you think i may hope you think

yes i think so said princess mary with a smile write to her
parents and leave it to me i will tell her when i can i wish it to
happen and my heart tells me it will

no it cannot be how happy i am but it cant be how happy i am
no it cant be pierre kept saying as he kissed princess marys hands

go to petersburg that will be best and i will write to you she
said

to petersburg go there very well ill go but i may come again
tomorrow

next day pierre came to say goodby natásha was less animated than she
had been the day before but that day as he looked at her pierre
sometimes felt as if he was vanishing and that neither he nor she
existed any longer that nothing existed but happiness is it possible
no it cant be he told himself at every look gesture and word that
filled his soul with joy

when on saying goodby he took her thin slender hand he could not help
holding it a little longer in his own

is it possible that this hand that face those eyes all this treasure
of feminine charm so strange to me now is it possible that it will one
day be mine forever as familiar to me as i am to myself no thats
impossible

goodbye count she said aloud i shall look forward very much to
your return she added in a whisper

and these simple words her look and the expression on her face which
accompanied them formed for two months the subject of inexhaustible
memories interpretations and happy meditations for pierre i shall
look forward very much to your return yes yes how did she say it
yes i shall look forward very much to your return oh how happy i
am what is happening to me how happy i am said pierre to himself





chapter xix

there was nothing in pierres soul now at all like what had troubled it
during his courtship of hélène

he did not repeat to himself with a sickening feeling of shame the words
he had spoken or say oh why did i not say that and whatever made
me say je vous aime on the contrary he now repeated in imagination
every word that he or natásha had spoken and pictured every detail of
her face and smile and did not wish to diminish or add anything but
only to repeat it again and again there was now not a shadow of doubt
in his mind as to whether what he had undertaken was right or wrong
only one terrible doubt sometimes crossed his mind wasnt it all a
dream isnt princess mary mistaken am i not too conceited and self
confident i believe all thisand suddenly princess mary will tell her
and she will be sure to smile and say how strange he must be deluding
himself doesnt he know that he is a man just a man while i i am
something altogether different and higher

that was the only doubt often troubling pierre he did not now make any
plans the happiness before him appeared so inconceivable that if only
he could attain it it would be the end of all things everything ended
with that

a joyful unexpected frenzy of which he had thought himself incapable
possessed him the whole meaning of lifenot for him alone but for the
whole worldseemed to him centered in his love and the possibility of
being loved by her at times everybody seemed to him to be occupied with
one thing onlyhis future happiness sometimes it seemed to him that
other people were all as pleased as he was himself and merely tried to
hide that pleasure by pretending to be busy with other interests in
every word and gesture he saw allusions to his happiness he often
surprised those he met by his significantly happy looks and smiles which
seemed to express a secret understanding between him and them and when
he realized that people might not be aware of his happiness he pitied
them with his whole heart and felt a desire somehow to explain to them
that all that occupied them was a mere frivolous trifle unworthy of
attention

when it was suggested to him that he should enter the civil service or
when the war or any general political affairs were discussed on the
assumption that everybodys welfare depended on this or that issue of
events he would listen with a mild and pitying smile and surprise
people by his strange comments but at this time he saw everybodyboth
those who as he imagined understood the real meaning of life that is
what he was feeling and those unfortunates who evidently did not
understand itin the bright light of the emotion that shone within
himself and at once without any effort saw in everyone he met
everything that was good and worthy of being loved

when dealing with the affairs and papers of his dead wife her memory
aroused in him no feeling but pity that she had not known the bliss he
now knew prince vasíli who having obtained a new post and some fresh
decorations was particularly proud at this time seemed to him a
pathetic kindly old man much to be pitied

often in afterlife pierre recalled this period of blissful insanity all
the views he formed of men and circumstances at this time remained true
for him always he not only did not renounce them subsequently but when
he was in doubt or inwardly at variance he referred to the views he had
held at this time of his madness and they always proved correct

i may have appeared strange and queer then he thought but i was not
so mad as i seemed on the contrary i was then wiser and had more
insight than at any other time and understood all that is worth
understanding in life because because i was happy

pierres insanity consisted in not waiting as he used to do to
discover personal attributes which he termed good qualities in people
before loving them his heart was now overflowing with love and by
loving people without cause he discovered indubitable causes for loving
them





chapter xx

after pierres departure that first evening when natásha had said to
princess mary with a gaily mocking smile he looks just yes just as
if he had come out of a russian bathin a short coat and with his hair
cropped something hidden and unknown to herself but irrepressible
awoke in natáshas soul

everything her face walk look and voice was suddenly altered to
her own surprise a power of life and hope of happiness rose to the
surface and demanded satisfaction from that evening she seemed to have
forgotten all that had happened to her she no longer complained of her
position did not say a word about the past and no longer feared to
make happy plans for the future she spoke little of pierre but when
princess mary mentioned him a longextinguished light once more kindled
in her eyes and her lips curved with a strange smile

the change that took place in natásha at first surprised princess mary
but when she understood its meaning it grieved her can she have loved
my brother so little as to be able to forget him so soon she thought
when she reflected on the change but when she was with natásha she was
not vexed with her and did not reproach her the reawakened power of
life that had seized natásha was so evidently irrepressible and
unexpected by her that in her presence princess mary felt that she had
no right to reproach her even in her heart

natásha gave herself up so fully and frankly to this new feeling that
she did not try to hide the fact that she was no longer sad but bright
and cheerful

when princess mary returned to her room after her nocturnal talk with
pierre natásha met her on the threshold

he has spoken yes he has spoken she repeated

and a joyful yet pathetic expression which seemed to beg forgiveness for
her joy settled on natáshas face

i wanted to listen at the door but i knew you would tell me

understandable and touching as the look with which natásha gazed at her
seemed to princess mary and sorry as she was to see her agitation
these words pained her for a moment she remembered her brother and his
love

but whats to be done she cant help it thought the princess

and with a sad and rather stern look she told natásha all that pierre
had said on hearing that he was going to petersburg natásha was
astounded

to petersburg she repeated as if unable to understand

but noticing the grieved expression on princess marys face she guessed
the reason of that sadness and suddenly began to cry

mary said she tell me what i should do i am afraid of being bad
whatever you tell me i will do tell me

you love him

yes whispered natásha

then why are you crying i am happy for your sake said princess mary
who because of those tears quite forgave natáshas joy

it wont be just yetsomeday think what fun it will be when i am his
wife and you marry nicholas

natásha i have asked you not to speak of that let us talk about you

they were silent awhile

but why go to petersburg natásha suddenly asked and hastily replied
to her own question but no no he must yes mary he must





first epilogue





chapter i

seven years had passed the stormtossed sea of european history had
subsided within its shores and seemed to have become calm but the
mysterious forces that move humanity mysterious because the laws of
their motion are unknown to us continued to operate

though the surface of the sea of history seemed motionless the movement
of humanity went on as unceasingly as the flow of time various groups
of people formed and dissolved the coming formation and dissolution of
kingdoms and displacement of peoples was in course of preparation

the sea of history was not driven spasmodically from shore to shore as
previously it was seething in its depths historic figures were not
borne by the waves from one shore to another as before they now seemed
to rotate on one spot the historical figures at the head of armies who
formerly reflected the movement of the masses by ordering wars
campaigns and battles now reflected the restless movement by political
and diplomatic combinations laws and treaties

the historians call this activity of the historical figures the
reaction

in dealing with this period they sternly condemn the historical
personages who in their opinion caused what they describe as the
reaction all the wellknown people of that period from alexander and
napoleon to madame de stael photius schelling fichte chateaubriand
and the rest pass before their stern judgment seat and are acquitted or
condemned according to whether they conduced to progress or to reaction

according to their accounts a reaction took place at that time in russia
also and the chief culprit was alexander i the same man who according
to them was the chief cause of the liberal movement at the commencement
of his reign being the savior of russia

there is no one in russian literature now from schoolboy essayist to
learned historian who does not throw his little stone at alexander for
things he did wrong at this period of his reign

he ought to have acted in this way and in that way in this case he did
well and in that case badly he behaved admirably at the beginning of
his reign and during  but acted badly by giving a constitution to
poland forming the holy alliance entrusting power to arakcheev
favoring golítsyn and mysticism and afterwards shishkov and photius he
also acted badly by concerning himself with the active army and
disbanding the semënov regiment

it would take a dozen pages to enumerate all the reproaches the
historians address to him based on their knowledge of what is good for
humanity

what do these reproaches mean

do not the very actions for which the historians praise alexander i the
liberal attempts at the beginning of his reign his struggle with
napoleon the firmness he displayed in  and the campaign of
flow from the same sourcesthe circumstances of his birth education
and lifethat made his personality what it was and from which the
actions for which they blame him the holy alliance the restoration of
poland and the reaction of  and later also flowed

in what does the substance of those reproaches lie

it lies in the fact that an historic character like alexander i
standing on the highest possible pinnacle of human power with the
blinding light of history focused upon him a character exposed to those
strongest of all influences the intrigues flattery and selfdeception
inseparable from power a character who at every moment of his life felt
a responsibility for all that was happening in europe and not a
fictitious but a live character who like every man had his personal
habits passions and impulses toward goodness beauty and truththat
this characterthough not lacking in virtue the historians do not
accuse him of thathad not the same conception of the welfare of
humanity fifty years ago as a presentday professor who from his youth
upwards has been occupied with learning that is with books and
lectures and with taking notes from them

but even if we assume that fifty years ago alexander i was mistaken in
his view of what was good for the people we must inevitably assume that
the historian who judges alexander will also after the lapse of some
time turn out to be mistaken in his view of what is good for humanity
this assumption is all the more natural and inevitable because watching
the movement of history we see that every year and with each new
writer opinion as to what is good for mankind changes so that what
once seemed good ten years later seems bad and vice versa and what is
more we find at one and the same time quite contradictory views as to
what is bad and what is good in history some people regard giving a
constitution to poland and forming the holy alliance as praiseworthy in
alexander while others regard it as blameworthy

the activity of alexander or of napoleon cannot be called useful or
harmful for it is impossible to say for what it was useful or harmful
if that activity displeases somebody this is only because it does not
agree with his limited understanding of what is good whether the
preservation of my fathers house in moscow or the glory of the russian
arms or the prosperity of the petersburg and other universities or the
freedom of poland or the greatness of russia or the balance of power in
europe or a certain kind of european culture called progress appear
to me to be good or bad i must admit that besides these things the
action of every historic character has other more general purposes
inaccessible to me

but let us assume that what is called science can harmonize all
contradictions and possesses an unchanging standard of good and bad by
which to try historic characters and events let us say that alexander
could have done everything differently let us say that with guidance
from those who blame him and who profess to know the ultimate aim of the
movement of humanity he might have arranged matters according to the
program his present accusers would have given himof nationality
freedom equality and progress these i think cover the ground let
us assume that this program was possible and had then been formulated
and that alexander had acted on it what would then have become of the
activity of all those who opposed the tendency that then prevailed in
the governmentan activity that in the opinion of the historians was
good and beneficent their activity would not have existed there would
have been no life there would have been nothing

if we admit that human life can be ruled by reason the possibility of
life is destroyed





chapter ii

if we assume as the historians do that great men lead humanity to the
attainment of certain endsthe greatness of russia or of france the
balance of power in europe the diffusion of the ideas of the
revolution general progress or anything elsethen it is impossible to
explain the facts of history without introducing the conceptions of
chance and genius

if the aim of the european wars at the beginning of the nineteenth
century had been the aggrandizement of russia that aim might have been
accomplished without all the preceding wars and without the invasion if
the aim was the aggrandizement of france that might have been attained
without the revolution and without the empire if the aim was the
dissemination of ideas the printing press could have accomplished that
much better than warfare if the aim was the progress of civilization
it is easy to see that there are other ways of diffusing civilization
more expedient than by the destruction of wealth and of human lives

why did it happen in this and not in some other way

because it happened so chance created the situation genius utilized
it says history

but what is chance what is genius

the words chance and genius do not denote any really existing thing and
therefore cannot be defined those words only denote a certain stage of
understanding of phenomena i do not know why a certain event occurs i
think that i cannot know it so i do not try to know it and i talk about
chance i see a force producing effects beyond the scope of ordinary
human agencies i do not understand why this occurs and i talk of
genius

to a herd of rams the ram the herdsman drives each evening into a
special enclosure to feed and that becomes twice as fat as the others
must seem to be a genius and it must appear an astonishing conjunction
of genius with a whole series of extraordinary chances that this ram
who instead of getting into the general fold every evening goes into a
special enclosure where there are oatsthat this very ram swelling with
fat is killed for meat

but the rams need only cease to suppose that all that happens to them
happens solely for the attainment of their sheepish aims they need only
admit that what happens to them may also have purposes beyond their ken
and they will at once perceive a unity and coherence in what happened to
the ram that was fattened even if they do not know for what purpose
they are fattened they will at least know that all that happened to the
ram did not happen accidentally and will no longer need the conceptions
of chance or genius

only by renouncing our claim to discern a purpose immediately
intelligible to us and admitting the ultimate purpose to be beyond our
ken may we discern the sequence of experiences in the lives of historic
characters and perceive the cause of the effect they produce
incommensurable with ordinary human capabilities and then the words
chance and genius become superfluous

we need only confess that we do not know the purpose of the european
convulsions and that we know only the factsthat is the murders first
in france then in italy in africa in prussia in austria in spain
and in russiaand that the movements from the west to the east and from
the east to the west form the essence and purpose of these events and
not only shall we have no need to see exceptional ability and genius in
napoleon and alexander but we shall be unable to consider them to be
anything but like other men and we shall not be obliged to have
recourse to chance for an explanation of those small events which made
these people what they were but it will be clear that all those small
events were inevitable

by discarding a claim to knowledge of the ultimate purpose we shall
clearly perceive that just as one cannot imagine a blossom or seed for
any single plant better suited to it than those it produces so it is
impossible to imagine any two people more completely adapted down to the
smallest detail for the purpose they had to fulfill than napoleon and
alexander with all their antecedents





chapter iii

the fundamental and essential significance of the european events of the
beginning of the nineteenth century lies in the movement of the mass of
the european peoples from west to east and afterwards from east to west
the commencement of that movement was the movement from west to east
for the peoples of the west to be able to make their warlike movement to
moscow it was necessary  that they should form themselves into a
military group of a size able to endure a collision with the warlike
military group of the east  that they should abandon all established
traditions and customs and  that during their military movement they
should have at their head a man who could justify to himself and to them
the deceptions robberies and murders which would have to be committed
during that movement

and beginning with the french revolution the old inadequately large
group was destroyed as well as the old habits and traditions and step
by step a group was formed of larger dimensions with new customs and
traditions and a man was produced who would stand at the head of the
coming movement and bear the responsibility for all that had to be done

a man without convictions without habits without traditions without a
name and not even a frenchman emergesby what seem the strangest
chancesfrom among all the seething french parties and without joining
anyone of them is borne forward to a prominent position

the ignorance of his colleagues the weakness and insignificance of his
opponents the frankness of his falsehoods and the dazzling and self
confident limitations of this man raise him to the head of the army the
brilliant qualities of the soldiers of the army sent to italy his
opponents reluctance to fight and his own childish audacity and self
confidence secure him military fame innumerable socalled chances
accompany him everywhere the disfavor into which he falls with the
rulers of france turns to his advantage his attempts to avoid his
predestined path are unsuccessful he is not received into the russian
service and the appointment he seeks in turkey comes to nothing during
the war in italy he is several times on the verge of destruction and
each time is saved in an unexpected manner owing to various diplomatic
considerations the russian armiesjust those which might have destroyed
his prestigedo not appear upon the scene till he is no longer there

on his return from italy he finds the government in paris in a process
of dissolution in which all those who are in it are inevitably wiped out
and destroyed and by chance an escape from this dangerous position
presents itself in the form of an aimless and senseless expedition to
africa again socalled chance accompanies him impregnable malta
surrenders without a shot his most reckless schemes are crowned with
success the enemys fleet which subsequently did not let a single boat
pass allows his entire army to elude it in africa a whole series of
outrages are committed against the almost unarmed inhabitants and the
men who commit these crimes especially their leader assure themselves
that this is admirable this is gloryit resembles caesar and alexander
the great and is therefore good

this ideal of glory and grandeurwhich consists not merely in
considering nothing wrong that one does but in priding oneself on every
crime one commits ascribing to it an incomprehensible supernatural
significancethat ideal destined to guide this man and his associates
had scope for its development in africa whatever he does succeeds the
plague does not touch him the cruelty of murdering prisoners is not
imputed to him as a fault his childishly rash uncalledfor and
ignoble departure from africa leaving his comrades in distress is set
down to his credit and again the enemys fleet twice lets him slip
past when intoxicated by the crimes he has committed so successfully
he reaches paris the dissolution of the republican government which a
year earlier might have ruined him has reached its extreme limit and
his presence there now as a newcomer free from party entanglements can
only serve to exalt himand though he himself has no plan he is quite
ready for his new role

he had no plan he was afraid of everything but the parties snatched at
him and demanded his participation

he alonewith his ideal of glory and grandeur developed in italy and
egypt his insane selfadulation his boldness in crime and frankness in
lyinghe alone could justify what had to be done

he is needed for the place that awaits him and so almost apart from his
will and despite his indecision his lack of a plan and all his
mistakes he is drawn into a conspiracy that aims at seizing power and
the conspiracy is crowned with success

he is pushed into a meeting of the legislature in alarm he wishes to
flee considering himself lost he pretends to fall into a swoon and
says senseless things that should have ruined him but the once proud
and shrewd rulers of france feeling that their part is played out are
even more bewildered than he and do not say the words they should have
said to destroy him and retain their power

chance millions of chances give him power and all men as if by
agreement cooperate to confirm that power chance forms the characters
of the rulers of france who submit to him chance forms the character
of paul i of russia who recognizes his government chance contrives a
plot against him which not only fails to harm him but confirms his
power chance puts the duc denghien in his hands and unexpectedly
causes him to kill himthereby convincing the mob more forcibly than in
any other way that he had the right since he had the might chance
contrives that though he directs all his efforts to prepare an
expedition against england which would inevitably have ruined him he
never carries out that intention but unexpectedly falls upon mack and
the austrians who surrender without a battle chance and genius give
him the victory at austerlitz and by chance all men not only the
french but all europeexcept england which does not take part in the
events about to happendespite their former horror and detestation of
his crimes now recognize his authority the title he has given himself
and his ideal of grandeur and glory which seems excellent and
reasonable to them all

as if measuring themselves and preparing for the coming movement the
western forces push toward the east several times in
and  gaining strength and growing in  the group of people that
had formed in france unites into one group with the peoples of central
europe the strength of the justification of the man who stands at the
head of the movement grows with the increased size of the group during
the tenyear preparatory period this man had formed relations with all
the crowned heads of europe the discredited rulers of the world can
oppose no reasonable ideal to the insensate napoleonic ideal of glory
and grandeur one after another they hasten to display their
insignificance before him the king of prussia sends his wife to seek
the great mans mercy the emperor of austria considers it a favor that
this man receives a daughter of the caesars into his bed the pope the
guardian of all that the nations hold sacred utilizes religion for the
aggrandizement of the great man it is not napoleon who prepares himself
for the accomplishment of his role so much as all those round him who
prepare him to take on himself the whole responsibility for what is
happening and has to happen there is no step no crime or petty fraud
he commits which in the mouths of those around him is not at once
represented as a great deed the most suitable fete the germans can
devise for him is a celebration of jena and auerstadt not only is he
great but so are his ancestors his brothers his stepsons and his
brothersinlaw everything is done to deprive him of the remains of his
reason and to prepare him for his terrible part and when he is ready so
too are the forces

the invasion pushes eastward and reaches its final goalmoscow that
city is taken the russian army suffers heavier losses than the opposing
armies had suffered in the former war from austerlitz to wagram but
suddenly instead of those chances and that genius which hitherto had so
consistently led him by an uninterrupted series of successes to the
predestined goal an innumerable sequence of inverse chances occurfrom
the cold in his head at borodino to the sparks which set moscow on fire
and the frostsand instead of genius stupidity and immeasurable
baseness become evident

the invaders flee turn back flee again and all the chances are now
not for napoleon but always against him

a countermovement is then accomplished from east to west with a
remarkable resemblance to the preceding movement from west to east
attempted drives from east to westsimilar to the contrary movements of
  and precede the great westward movement there is the
same coalescence into a group of enormous dimensions the same adhesion
of the people of central europe to the movement the same hesitation
midway and the same increasing rapidity as the goal is approached

paris the ultimate goal is reached the napoleonic government and army
are destroyed napoleon himself is no longer of any account all his
actions are evidently pitiful and mean but again an inexplicable chance
occurs the allies detest napoleon whom they regard as the cause of
their sufferings deprived of power and authority his crimes and his
craft exposed he should have appeared to them what he appeared ten
years previously and one year lateran outlawed brigand but by some
strange chance no one perceives this his part is not yet ended the man
who ten years before and a year later was considered an outlawed brigand
is sent to an island two days sail from france which for some reason
is presented to him as his dominion and guards are given to him and
millions of money are paid him





chapter iv

the flood of nations begins to subside into its normal channels the
waves of the great movement abate and on the calm surface eddies are
formed in which float the diplomatists who imagine that they have
caused the floods to abate

but the smooth sea again suddenly becomes disturbed the diplomatists
think that their disagreements are the cause of this fresh pressure of
natural forces they anticipate war between their sovereigns the
position seems to them insoluble but the wave they feel to be rising
does not come from the quarter they expect it rises again from the same
point as beforeparis the last backwash of the movement from the west
occurs a backwash which serves to solve the apparently insuperable
diplomatic difficulties and ends the military movement of that period of
history

the man who had devastated france returns to france alone without any
conspiracy and without soldiers any guard might arrest him but by
strange chance no one does so and all rapturously greet the man they
cursed the day before and will curse again a month later

this man is still needed to justify the final collective act

that act is performed

the last role is played the actor is bidden to disrobe and wash off his
powder and paint he will not be wanted any more

and some years pass during which he plays a pitiful comedy to himself in
solitude on his island justifying his actions by intrigues and lies
when the justification is no longer needed and displaying to the whole
world what it was that people had mistaken for strength as long as an
unseen hand directed his actions

the manager having brought the drama to a close and stripped the actor
shows him to us

see what you believed in this is he do you now see that it was not he
but i who moved you

but dazed by the force of the movement it was long before people
understood this

still greater coherence and inevitability is seen in the life of
alexander i the man who stood at the head of the countermovement from
east to west

what was needed for him who overshadowing others stood at the head of
that movement from east to west

what was needed was a sense of justice and a sympathy with european
affairs but a remote sympathy not dulled by petty interests a moral
superiority over those sovereigns of the day who cooperated with him a
mild and attractive personality and a personal grievance against
napoleon and all this was found in alexander i all this had been
prepared by innumerable socalled chances in his life his education
his early liberalism the advisers who surrounded him and by
austerlitz and tilsit and erfurt

during the national war he was inactive because he was not needed but
as soon as the necessity for a general european war presented itself he
appeared in his place at the given moment and uniting the nations of
europe led them to the goal

the goal is reached after the final war of  alexander possesses all
possible power how does he use it

alexander ithe pacifier of europe the man who from his early years had
striven only for his peoples welfare the originator of the liberal
innovations in his fatherlandnow that he seemed to possess the utmost
power and therefore to have the possibility of bringing about the
welfare of his peoplesat the time when napoleon in exile was drawing up
childish and mendacious plans of how he would have made mankind happy
had he retained poweralexander i having fulfilled his mission and
feeling the hand of god upon him suddenly recognizes the insignificance
of that supposed power turns away from it and gives it into the hands
of contemptible men whom he despises saying only

not unto us not unto us but unto thy name i too am a man like the
rest of you let me live like a man and think of my soul and of god

as the sun and each atom of ether is a sphere complete in itself and
yet at the same time only a part of a whole too immense for man to
comprehend so each individual has within himself his own aims and yet
has them to serve a general purpose incomprehensible to man

a bee settling on a flower has stung a child and the child is afraid of
bees and declares that bees exist to sting people a poet admires the
bee sucking from the chalice of a flower and says it exists to suck the
fragrance of flowers a beekeeper seeing the bee collect pollen from
flowers and carry it to the hive says that it exists to gather honey
another beekeeper who has studied the life of the hive more closely says
that the bee gathers pollen dust to feed the young bees and rear a
queen and that it exists to perpetuate its race a botanist notices
that the bee flying with the pollen of a male flower to a pistil
fertilizes the latter and sees in this the purpose of the bees
existence another observing the migration of plants notices that the
bee helps in this work and may say that in this lies the purpose of the
bee but the ultimate purpose of the bee is not exhausted by the first
the second or any of the processes the human mind can discern the
higher the human intellect rises in the discovery of these purposes the
more obvious it becomes that the ultimate purpose is beyond our
comprehension

all that is accessible to man is the relation of the life of the bee to
other manifestations of life and so it is with the purpose of historic
characters and nations





chapter v

natáshas wedding to bezúkhov which took place in  was the last
happy event in the family of the old rostóvs count ilyá rostóv died
that same year and as always happens after the fathers death the
family group broke up

the events of the previous year the burning of moscow and the flight
from it the death of prince andrew natáshas despair pétyas death
and the old countess grief fell blow after blow on the old counts
head he seemed to be unable to understand the meaning of all these
events and bowed his old head in a spiritual sense as if expecting and
inviting further blows which would finish him he seemed now frightened
and distraught and now unnaturally animated and enterprising

the arrangements for natáshas marriage occupied him for a while he
ordered dinners and suppers and obviously tried to appear cheerful but
his cheerfulness was not infectious as it used to be on the contrary it
evoked the compassion of those who knew and liked him

when pierre and his wife had left he grew very quiet and began to
complain of depression a few days later he fell ill and took to his
bed he realized from the first that he would not get up again despite
the doctors encouragement the countess passed a fortnight in an
armchair by his pillow without undressing every time she gave him his
medicine he sobbed and silently kissed her hand on his last day
sobbing he asked her and his absent son to forgive him for having
dissipated their propertythat being the chief fault of which he was
conscious after receiving communion and unction he quietly died and
next day a throng of acquaintances who came to pay their last respects
to the deceased filled the house rented by the rostóvs all these
acquaintances who had so often dined and danced at his house and had so
often laughed at him now said with a common feeling of selfreproach
and emotion as if justifying themselves well whatever he may have
been he was a most worthy man you dont meet such men nowadays and
which of us has not weaknesses of his own

it was just when the counts affairs had become so involved that it was
impossible to say what would happen if he lived another year that he
unexpectedly died

nicholas was with the russian army in paris when the news of his
fathers death reached him he at once resigned his commission and
without waiting for it to be accepted took leave of absence and went to
moscow the state of the counts affairs became quite obvious a month
after his death surprising everyone by the immense total of small debts
the existence of which no one had suspected the debts amounted to
double the value of the property

friends and relations advised nicholas to decline the inheritance but
he regarded such a refusal as a slur on his fathers memory which he
held sacred and therefore would not hear of refusing and accepted the
inheritance together with the obligation to pay the debts

the creditors who had so long been silent restrained by a vague but
powerful influence exerted on them while he lived by the counts
careless good nature all proceeded to enforce their claims at once as
always happens in such cases rivalry sprang up as to which should get
paid first and those who like mitenka held promissory notes given them
as presents now became the most exacting of the creditors nicholas was
allowed no respite and no peace and those who had seemed to pity the
old manthe cause of their losses if they were lossesnow
remorselessly pursued the young heir who had voluntarily undertaken the
debts and was obviously not guilty of contracting them

not one of the plans nicholas tried succeeded the estate was sold by
auction for half its value and half the debts still remained unpaid
nicholas accepted thirty thousand rubles offered him by his brotherin
law bezúkhov to pay off debts he regarded as genuinely due for value
received and to avoid being imprisoned for the remainder as the
creditors threatened he reentered the government service

he could not rejoin the army where he would have been made colonel at
the next vacancy for his mother now clung to him as her one hold on
life and so despite his reluctance to remain in moscow among people who
had known him before and despite his abhorrence of the civil service
he accepted a post in moscow in that service doffed the uniform of
which he was so fond and moved with his mother and sónya to a small
house on the sivtsev vrazhek

natásha and pierre were living in petersburg at the time and had no
clear idea of nicholas circumstances having borrowed money from his
brotherinlaw nicholas tried to hide his wretched condition from him
his position was the more difficult because with his salary of twelve
hundred rubles he had not only to keep himself his mother and sónya
but had to shield his mother from knowledge of their poverty the
countess could not conceive of life without the luxurious conditions she
had been used to from childhood and unable to realize how hard it was
for her son kept demanding now a carriage which they did not keep to
send for a friend now some expensive article of food for herself or
wine for her son or money to buy a present as a surprise for natásha or
sónya or for nicholas himself

sónya kept house attended on her aunt read to her put up with her
whims and secret illwill and helped nicholas to conceal their poverty
from the old countess nicholas felt himself irredeemably indebted to
sónya for all she was doing for his mother and greatly admired her
patience and devotion but tried to keep aloof from her

he seemed in his heart to reproach her for being too perfect and
because there was nothing to reproach her with she had all that people
are valued for but little that could have made him love her he felt
that the more he valued her the less he loved her he had taken her at
her word when she wrote giving him his freedom and now behaved as if all
that had passed between them had been long forgotten and could never in
any case be renewed

nicholas position became worse and worse the idea of putting something
aside out of his salary proved a dream not only did he not save
anything but to comply with his mothers demands he even incurred some
small debts he could see no way out of this situation the idea of
marrying some rich woman which was suggested to him by his female
relations was repugnant to him the other way outhis mothers
deathnever entered his head he wished for nothing and hoped for
nothing and deep in his heart experienced a gloomy and stern
satisfaction in an uncomplaining endurance of his position he tried to
avoid his old acquaintances with their commiseration and offensive
offers of assistance he avoided all distraction and recreation and
even at home did nothing but play cards with his mother pace silently
up and down the room and smoke one pipe after another he seemed
carefully to cherish within himself the gloomy mood which alone enabled
him to endure his position





chapter vi

at the beginning of winter princess mary came to moscow from reports
current in town she learned how the rostóvs were situated and how the
son has sacrificed himself for his mother as people were saying

i never expected anything else of him said princess mary to herself
feeling a joyous sense of her love for him remembering her friendly
relations with all the rostóvs which had made her almost a member of the
family she thought it her duty to go to see them but remembering her
relations with nicholas in voronezh she was shy about doing so making a
great effort she did however go to call on them a few weeks after her
arrival in moscow

nicholas was the first to meet her as the countess room could only be
reached through his but instead of being greeted with pleasure as she
had expected at his first glance at her his face assumed a cold stiff
proud expression she had not seen on it before he inquired about her
health led the way to his mother and having sat there for five minutes
left the room

when the princess came out of the countess room nicholas met her again
and with marked solemnity and stiffness accompanied her to the anteroom
to her remarks about his mothers health he made no reply whats that
to you leave me in peace his looks seemed to say

why does she come prowling here what does she want i cant bear these
ladies and all these civilities said he aloud in sónyas presence
evidently unable to repress his vexation after the princess carriage
had disappeared

oh nicholas how can you talk like that cried sónya hardly able to
conceal her delight she is so kind and mamma is so fond of her

nicholas did not reply and tried to avoid speaking of the princess any
more but after her visit the old countess spoke of her several times a
day

she sang her praises insisted that her son must call on her expressed
a wish to see her often but yet always became illhumored when she
began to talk about her

nicholas tried to keep silence when his mother spoke of the princess
but his silence irritated her

she is a very admirable and excellent young woman said she and you
must go and call on her you would at least be seeing somebody and i
think it must be dull for you only seeing us

but i dont in the least want to mamma

you used to want to and now you dont really i dont understand you
my dear one day you are dull and the next you refuse to see anyone

but i never said i was dull

why you said yourself you dont want even to see her she is a very
admirable young woman and you always liked her but now suddenly you
have got some notion or other in your head you hide everything from
me

not at all mamma

if i were asking you to do something disagreeable nowbut i only ask
you to return a call one would think mere politeness required it
well i have asked you and now i wont interfere any more since you
have secrets from your mother

well then ill go if you wish it

it doesnt matter to me i only wish it for your sake

nicholas sighed bit his mustache and laid out the cards for a
patience trying to divert his mothers attention to another topic

the same conversation was repeated next day and the day after and the
day after that

after her visit to the rostóvs and her unexpectedly chilly reception by
nicholas princess mary confessed to herself that she had been right in
not wishing to be the first to call

i expected nothing else she told herself calling her pride to her
aid i have nothing to do with him and i only wanted to see the old
lady who was always kind to me and to whom i am under many
obligations

but she could not pacify herself with these reflections a feeling akin
to remorse troubled her when she thought of her visit though she had
firmly resolved not to call on the rostóvs again and to forget the whole
matter she felt herself all the time in an awkward position and when
she asked herself what distressed her she had to admit that it was her
relation to rostóv his cold polite manner did not express his feeling
for her she knew that but it concealed something and until she could
discover what that something was she felt that she could not be at
ease

one day in midwinter when sitting in the schoolroom attending to her
nephews lessons she was informed that rostóv had called with a firm
resolution not to betray herself and not show her agitation she sent
for mademoiselle bourienne and went with her to the drawing room

her first glance at nicholas face told her that he had only come to
fulfill the demands of politeness and she firmly resolved to maintain
the tone in which he addressed her

they spoke of the countess health of their mutual friends of the
latest war news and when the ten minutes required by propriety had
elapsed after which a visitor may rise nicholas got up to say goodby

with mademoiselle bouriennes help the princess had maintained the
conversation very well but at the very last moment just when he rose
she was so tired of talking of what did not interest her and her mind
was so full of the question why she alone was granted so little
happiness in life that in a fit of absentmindedness she sat still her
luminous eyes gazing fixedly before her not noticing that he had risen

nicholas glanced at her and wishing to appear not to notice her
abstraction made some remark to mademoiselle bourienne and then again
looked at the princess she still sat motionless with a look of
suffering on her gentle face he suddenly felt sorry for her and was
vaguely conscious that he might be the cause of the sadness her face
expressed he wished to help her and say something pleasant but could
think of nothing to say

goodbye princess said he

she started flushed and sighed deeply

oh i beg your pardon she said as if waking up are you going
already count well then goodby oh but the cushion for the
countess

wait a moment ill fetch it said mademoiselle bourienne and she
left the room

they both sat silent with an occasional glance at one another

yes princess said nicholas at last with a sad smile it doesnt
seem long ago since we first met at bogucharovo but how much water has
flowed since then in what distress we all seemed to be then yet i
would give much to bring back that time but theres no bringing it
back

princess mary gazed intently into his eyes with her own luminous ones as
he said this she seemed to be trying to fathom the hidden meaning of
his words which would explain his feeling for her

yes yes said she but you have no reason to regret the past count
as i understand your present life i think you will always recall it
with satisfaction because the selfsacrifice that fills it now

i cannot accept your praise he interrupted her hurriedly on the
contrary i continually reproach myself but this is not at all an
interesting or cheerful subject

his face again resumed its former stiff and cold expression but the
princess had caught a glimpse of the man she had known and loved and it
was to him that she now spoke

i thought you would allow me to tell you this she said i had come
so near to you and to all your family that i thought you would not
consider my sympathy misplaced but i was mistaken and suddenly her
voice trembled i dont know why she continued recovering herself
but you used to be different and

there are a thousand reasons why laying special emphasis on the why
thank you princess he added softly sometimes it is hard

so thats why thats why a voice whispered in princess marys soul
no it was not only that gay kind and frank look not only that
handsome exterior that i loved in him i divined his noble resolute
selfsacrificing spirit too she said to herself yes he is poor now
and i am rich yes thats the only reason yes were it not for
that and remembering his former tenderness and looking now at his
kind sorrowful face she suddenly understood the cause of his coldness

but why count why she almost cried unconsciously moving closer to
him why tell me you must tell me

he was silent

i dont understand your why count she continued but its hard for
me i confess it for some reason you wish to deprive me of our former
friendship and that hurts me there were tears in her eyes and in her
voice i have had so little happiness in life that every loss is hard
for me to bear excuse me goodby and suddenly she began to cry
and was hurrying from the room

princess for gods sake he exclaimed trying to stop her
princess

she turned round for a few seconds they gazed silently into one
anothers eyesand what had seemed impossible and remote suddenly became
possible inevitable and very near





chapter vii

in the winter of  nicholas married princess mary and moved to bald
hills with his wife his mother and sónya

within four years he had paid off all his remaining debts without
selling any of his wifes property and having received a small
inheritance on the death of a cousin he paid his debt to pierre as well

in another three years by  he had so managed his affairs that he
was able to buy a small estate adjoining bald hills and was negotiating
to buy back otradnoethat being his pet dream

having started farming from necessity he soon grew so devoted to it
that it became his favorite and almost his sole occupation nicholas was
a plain farmer he did not like innovations especially the english ones
then coming into vogue he laughed at theoretical treatises on estate
management disliked factories the raising of expensive products and
the buying of expensive seed corn and did not make a hobby of any
particular part of the work on his estate he always had before his
minds eye the estate as a whole and not any particular part of it the
chief thing in his eyes was not the nitrogen in the soil nor the oxygen
in the air nor manures nor special plows but that most important
agent by which nitrogen oxygen manure and plow were made
effectivethe peasant laborer when nicholas first began farming and
began to understand its different branches it was the serf who
especially attracted his attention the peasant seemed to him not merely
a tool but also a judge of farming and an end in himself at first he
watched the serfs trying to understand their aims and what they
considered good and bad and only pretended to direct them and give
orders while in reality learning from them their methods their manner
of speech and their judgment of what was good and bad only when he had
understood the peasants tastes and aspirations had learned to talk
their language to grasp the hidden meaning of their words and felt
akin to them did he begin boldly to manage his serfs that is to
perform toward them the duties demanded of him and nicholas management
produced very brilliant results

guided by some gift of insight on taking up the management of the
estates he at once unerringly appointed as bailiff village elder and
delegate the very men the serfs would themselves have chosen had they
had the right to choose and these posts never changed hands before
analyzing the properties of manure before entering into the debit and
credit as he ironically called it he found out how many cattle the
peasants had and increased the number by all possible means he kept the
peasant families together in the largest groups possible not allowing
the family groups to divide into separate households he was hard alike
on the lazy the depraved and the weak and tried to get them expelled
from the commune

he was as careful of the sowing and reaping of the peasants hay and
corn as of his own and few landowners had their crops sown and
harvested so early and so well or got so good a return as did
nicholas

he disliked having anything to do with the domestic serfsthe drones
as he called themand everyone said he spoiled them by his laxity when
a decision had to be taken regarding a domestic serf especially if one
had to be punished he always felt undecided and consulted everybody in
the house but when it was possible to have a domestic serf conscripted
instead of a land worker he did so without the least hesitation he
never felt any hesitation in dealing with the peasants he knew that his
every decision would be approved by them all with very few exceptions

he did not allow himself either to be hard on or punish a man or to
make things easy for or reward anyone merely because he felt inclined
to do so he could not have said by what standard he judged what he
should or should not do but the standard was quite firm and definite in
his own mind

often speaking with vexation of some failure or irregularity he would
say what can one do with our russian peasants and imagined that he
could not bear them

yet he loved our russian peasants and their way of life with his whole
soul and for that very reason had understood and assimilated the one
way and manner of farming which produced good results

countess mary was jealous of this passion of her husbands and regretted
that she could not share it but she could not understand the joys and
vexations he derived from that world to her so remote and alien she
could not understand why he was so particularly animated and happy when
after getting up at daybreak and spending the whole morning in the
fields or on the threshing floor he returned from the sowing or mowing
or reaping to have tea with her she did not understand why he spoke
with such admiration and delight of the farming of the thrifty and well
todo peasant matthew ermishin who with his family had carted corn all
night or of the fact that his nicholas sheaves were already stacked
before anyone else had his harvest in she did not understand why he
stepped out from the window to the veranda and smiled under his mustache
and winked so joyfully when warm steady rain began to fall on the dry
and thirsty shoots of the young oats or why when the wind carried away
a threatening cloud during the hay harvest he would return from the
barn flushed sunburned and perspiring with a smell of wormwood and
gentian in his hair and gleefully rubbing his hands would say well
one more day and my grain and the peasants will all be under cover

still less did she understand why he kindhearted and always ready to
anticipate her wishes should become almost desperate when she brought
him a petition from some peasant men or women who had appealed to her to
be excused some work why he that kind nicholas should obstinately
refuse her angrily asking her not to interfere in what was not her
business she felt he had a world apart which he loved passionately and
which had laws she had not fathomed

sometimes when trying to understand him she spoke of the good work he
was doing for his serfs he would be vexed and reply not in the least
it never entered my head and i wouldnt do that for their good thats
all poetry and old wives talkall that doing good to ones neighbor
what i want is that our children should not have to go begging i must
put our affairs in order while i am alive thats all and to do that
order and strictness are essential thats all about it said he
clenching his vigorous fist and fairness of course he added for
if the peasant is naked and hungry and has only one miserable horse he
can do no good either for himself or for me

and all nicholas did was fruitfulprobably just because he refused to
allow himself to think that he was doing good to others for virtues
sake his means increased rapidly serfs from neighboring estates came
to beg him to buy them and long after his death the memory of his
administration was devoutly preserved among the serfs he was a
master the peasants affairs first and then his own of course he was
not to be trifled with eitherin a word he was a real master





chapter viii

one matter connected with his management sometimes worried nicholas and
that was his quick temper together with his old hussar habit of making
free use of his fists at first he saw nothing reprehensible in this
but in the second year of his marriage his view of that form of
punishment suddenly changed

once in summer he had sent for the village elder from bogucharovo a man
who had succeeded to the post when dron died and who was accused of
dishonesty and various irregularities nicholas went out into the porch
to question him and immediately after the elder had given a few replies
the sound of cries and blows were heard on returning to lunch nicholas
went up to his wife who sat with her head bent low over her embroidery
frame and as usual began to tell her what he had been doing that
morning among other things he spoke of the bogucharovo elder countess
mary turned red and then pale but continued to sit with head bowed and
lips compressed and gave her husband no reply

such an insolent scoundrel he cried growing hot again at the mere
recollection of him if he had told me he was drunk and did not see
but what is the matter with you mary he suddenly asked

countess mary raised her head and tried to speak but hastily looked
down again and her lips puckered

why whatever is the matter my dearest

the looks of the plain countess mary always improved when she was in
tears she never cried from pain or vexation but always from sorrow or
pity and when she wept her radiant eyes acquired an irresistible charm

the moment nicholas took her hand she could no longer restrain herself
and began to cry

nicholas i saw it he was to blame but why do you nicholas and
she covered her face with her hands

nicholas said nothing he flushed crimson left her side and paced up
and down the room he understood what she was weeping about but could
not in his heart at once agree with her that what he had regarded from
childhood as quite an everyday event was wrong is it just
sentimentality old wives tales or is she right he asked himself
before he had solved that point he glanced again at her face filled with
love and pain and he suddenly realized that she was right and that he
had long been sinning against himself

mary he said softly going up to her it will never happen again i
give you my word never he repeated in a trembling voice like a boy
asking for forgiveness

the tears flowed faster still from the countess eyes she took his hand
and kissed it

nicholas when did you break your cameo she asked to change the
subject looking at his finger on which he wore a ring with a cameo of
laocoons head

todayit was the same affair oh mary dont remind me of it and
again he flushed i give you my word of honor it shant occur again
and let this always be a reminder to me and he pointed to the broken
ring

after that when in discussions with his village elders or stewards the
blood rushed to his face and his fists began to clench nicholas would
turn the broken ring on his finger and would drop his eyes before the
man who was making him angry but he did forget himself once or twice
within a twelvemonth and then he would go and confess to his wife and
would again promise that this should really be the very last time

mary you must despise me he would say i deserve it

you should go go away at once if you dont feel strong enough to
control yourself she would reply sadly trying to comfort her husband

among the gentry of the province nicholas was respected but not liked
he did not concern himself with the interests of his own class and
consequently some thought him proud and others thought him stupid the
whole summer from spring sowing to harvest he was busy with the work
on his farm in autumn he gave himself up to hunting with the same
businesslike seriousnessleaving home for a month or even two with
his hunt in winter he visited his other villages or spent his time
reading the books he read were chiefly historical and on these he
spent a certain sum every year he was collecting as he said a serious
library and he made it a rule to read through all the books he bought
he would sit in his study with a grave air readinga task he first
imposed upon himself as a duty but which afterwards became a habit
affording him a special kind of pleasure and a consciousness of being
occupied with serious matters in winter except for business
excursions he spent most of his time at home making himself one with
his family and entering into all the details of his childrens relations
with their mother the harmony between him and his wife grew closer and
closer and he daily discovered fresh spiritual treasures in her

from the time of his marriage sónya had lived in his house before that
nicholas had told his wife all that had passed between himself and
sónya blaming himself and commending her he had asked princess mary to
be gentle and kind to his cousin she thoroughly realized the wrong he
had done sónya felt herself to blame toward her and imagined that her
wealth had influenced nicholas choice she could not find fault with
sónya in any way and tried to be fond of her but often felt illwill
toward her which she could not overcome

once she had a talk with her friend natásha about sónya and about her
own injustice toward her

you know said natásha you have read the gospels a great dealthere
is a passage in them that just fits sónya

what asked countess mary surprised

to him that hath shall be given and from him that hath not shall be
taken away you remember she is one that hath not why i dont know
perhaps she lacks egotism i dont know but from her is taken away and
everything has been taken away sometimes i am dreadfully sorry for her
formerly i very much wanted nicholas to marry her but i always had a
sort of presentiment that it would not come off she is a sterile
flower you knowlike some strawberry blossoms sometimes i am sorry for
her and sometimes i think she doesnt feel it as you or i would

though countess mary told natásha that those words in the gospel must be
understood differently yet looking at sónya she agreed with natáshas
explanation it really seemed that sónya did not feel her position
trying and had grown quite reconciled to her lot as a sterile flower
she seemed to be fond not so much of individuals as of the family as a
whole like a cat she had attached herself not to the people but to the
home she waited on the old countess petted and spoiled the children
was always ready to render the small services for which she had a gift
and all this was unconsciously accepted from her with insufficient
gratitude

the country seat at bald hills had been rebuilt though not on the same
scale as under the old prince

the buildings begun under straitened circumstances were more than
simple the immense house on the old stone foundations was of wood
plastered only inside it had bare deal floors and was furnished with
very simple hard sofas armchairs tables and chairs made by their own
serf carpenters out of their own birchwood the house was spacious and
had rooms for the house serfs and apartments for visitors whole
families of the rostóvs and bolkónskis relations sometimes came to
bald hills with sixteen horses and dozens of servants and stayed for
months besides that four times a year on the name days and birthdays
of the hosts as many as a hundred visitors would gather there for a day
or two the rest of the year life pursued its unbroken routine with its
ordinary occupations and its breakfasts lunches dinners and suppers
provided out of the produce of the estate





chapter ix

it was the eve of st nicholas the fifth of december  natásha had
been staying at her brothers with her husband and children since early
autumn pierre had gone to petersburg on business of his own for three
weeks as he said but had remained there nearly seven weeks and was
expected back every minute

besides the bezúkhov family nicholas old friend the retired general
vasíli dmítrich denisov was staying with the rostóvs this fifth of
december

on the sixth which was his name day when the house would be full of
visitors nicholas knew he would have to exchange his tartar tunic for a
tail coat and put on narrow boots with pointed toes and drive to the
new church he had built and then receive visitors who would come to
congratulate him offer them refreshments and talk about the elections
of the nobility but he considered himself entitled to spend the eve of
that day in his usual way he examined the bailiffs accounts of the
village in ryazan which belonged to his wifes nephew wrote two
business letters and walked over to the granaries cattle yards and
stables before dinner having taken precautions against the general
drunkenness to be expected on the morrow because it was a great saints
day he returned to dinner and without having time for a private talk
with his wife sat down at the long table laid for twenty persons at
which the whole household had assembled at that table were his mother
his mothers old lady companion belova his wife their three children
with their governess and tutor his wifes nephew with his tutor sónya
denisov natásha her three children their governess and old michael
ivánovich the late princes architect who was living on in retirement
at bald hills

countess mary sat at the other end of the table when her husband took
his place she concluded from the rapid manner in which after taking up
his table napkin he pushed back the tumbler and wineglass standing
before him that he was out of humor as was sometimes the case when he
came in to dinner straight from the farmespecially before the soup
countess mary well knew that mood of his and when she herself was in a
good frame of mind quietly waited till he had had his soup and then
began to talk to him and make him admit that there was no cause for his
illhumor but today she quite forgot that and was hurt that he should
be angry with her without any reason and she felt unhappy she asked
him where he had been he replied she again inquired whether everything
was going well on the farm her unnatural tone made him wince
unpleasantly and he replied hastily

then im not mistaken thought countess mary why is he cross with
me she concluded from his tone that he was vexed with her and wished
to end the conversation she knew her remarks sounded unnatural but
could not refrain from asking some more questions

thanks to denisov the conversation at table soon became general and
lively and she did not talk to her husband when they left the table
and went as usual to thank the old countess countess mary held out her
hand and kissed her husband and asked him why he was angry with her

you always have such strange fancies i didnt even think of being
angry he replied

but the word always seemed to her to imply yes i am angry but i wont
tell you why

nicholas and his wife lived together so happily that even sónya and the
old countess who felt jealous and would have liked them to disagree
could find nothing to reproach them with but even they had their
moments of antagonism occasionally and it was always just after they
had been happiest together they suddenly had a feeling of estrangement
and hostility which occurred most frequently during countess marys
pregnancies and this was such a time

well messieurs et mesdames said nicholas loudly and with apparent
cheerfulness it seemed to countess mary that he did it on purpose to
vex her i have been on my feet since six this morning tomorrow i
shall have to suffer so today ill go and rest

and without a word to his wife he went to the little sitting room and
lay down on the sofa

thats always the way thought countess mary he talks to everyone
except me i see i see that i am repulsive to him especially when i
am in this condition she looked down at her expanded figure and in the
glass at her pale sallow emaciated face in which her eyes now looked
larger than ever

and everything annoyed herdenisovs shouting and laughter natáshas
talk and especially a quick glance sónya gave her

sónya was always the first excuse countess mary found for feeling
irritated

having sat awhile with her visitors without understanding anything of
what they were saying she softly left the room and went to the nursery

the children were playing at going to moscow in a carriage made of
chairs and invited her to go with them she sat down and played with
them a little but the thought of her husband and his unreasonable
crossness worried her she got up and walking on tiptoe with
difficulty went to the small sitting room

perhaps he is not asleep ill have an explanation with him she said
to herself little andrew her eldest boy imitating his mother
followed her on tiptoe she did not notice him

mary dear i think he is asleephe was so tired said sónya meeting
her in the large sitting room it seemed to countess mary that she
crossed her path everywhere andrew may wake him

countess mary looked round saw little andrew following her felt that
sónya was right and for that very reason flushed and with evident
difficulty refrained from saying something harsh she made no reply but
to avoid obeying sónya beckoned to andrew to follow her quietly and went
to the door sónya went away by another door from the room in which
nicholas was sleeping came the sound of his even breathing every
slightest tone of which was familiar to his wife as she listened to it
she saw before her his smooth handsome forehead his mustache and his
whole face as she had so often seen it in the stillness of the night
when he slept nicholas suddenly moved and cleared his throat and at
that moment little andrew shouted from outside the door papa mammas
standing here countess mary turned pale with fright and made signs to
the boy he grew silent and quiet ensued for a moment terrible to
countess mary she knew how nicholas disliked being waked then through
the door she heard nicholas clearing his throat again and stirring and
his voice said crossly

i cant get a moments peace mary is that you why did you bring
him here

i only came in to look and did not notice forgive me

nicholas coughed and said no more countess mary moved away from the
door and took the boy back to the nursery five minutes later little
blackeyed threeyearold natásha her fathers pet having learned from
her brother that papa was asleep and mamma was in the sitting room ran
to her father unobserved by her mother the darkeyed little girl boldly
opened the creaking door went up to the sofa with energetic steps of
her sturdy little legs and having examined the position of her father
who was asleep with his back to her rose on tiptoe and kissed the hand
which lay under his head nicholas turned with a tender smile on his
face

natásha natásha came countess marys frightened whisper from the
door papa wants to sleep

no mamma he doesnt want to sleep said little natásha with
conviction hes laughing

nicholas lowered his legs rose and took his daughter in his arms

come in mary he said to his wife

she went in and sat down by her husband

i did not notice him following me she said timidly i just looked
in

holding his little girl with one arm nicholas glanced at his wife and
seeing her guilty expression put his other arm around her and kissed
her hair

may i kiss mamma he asked natásha

natásha smiled bashfully

again she commanded pointing with a peremptory gesture to the spot
where nicholas had placed the kiss

i dont know why you think i am cross said nicholas replying to the
question he knew was in his wifes mind

you have no idea how unhappy how lonely i feel when you are like
that it always seems to me

mary dont talk nonsense you ought to be ashamed of yourself he
said gaily

it seems to be that you cant love me that i am so plain always
and now in this cond

oh how absurd you are it is not beauty that endears its love that
makes us see beauty it is only malvinas and women of that kind who are
loved for their beauty but do i love my wife i dont love her but
i dont know how to put it without you or when something comes between
us like this i seem lost and cant do anything now do i love my
finger i dont love it but just try to cut it off

im not like that myself but i understand so youre not angry with
me

awfully angry he said smiling and getting up and smoothing his hair
he began to pace the room

do you know mary what ive been thinking he began immediately
thinking aloud in his wifes presence now that they had made it up

he did not ask if she was ready to listen to him he did not care a
thought had occurred to him and so it belonged to her also and he told
her of his intention to persuade pierre to stay with them till spring

countess mary listened till he had finished made some remark and in
her turn began thinking aloud her thoughts were about the children

you can see the woman in her already she said in french pointing to
little natásha you reproach us women with being illogical here is our
logic i say papa wants to sleep but she says no hes laughing
and she was right said countess mary with a happy smile

yes yes and nicholas taking his little daughter in his strong hand
lifted her high placed her on his shoulder held her by the legs and
paced the room with her there was an expression of carefree happiness
on the faces of both father and daughter

but you know you may be unfair you are too fond of this one his wife
whispered in french

yes but what am i to do i try not to show

at that moment they heard the sound of the door pulley and footsteps in
the hall and anteroom as if someone had arrived

somebody has come

i am sure it is pierre i will go and see said countess mary and left
the room

in her absence nicholas allowed himself to give his little daughter a
gallop round the room out of breath he took the laughing child quickly
from his shoulder and pressed her to his heart his capers reminded him
of dancing and looking at the childs round happy little face he
thought of what she would be like when he was an old man taking her
into society and dancing the mazurka with her as his old father had
danced daniel cooper with his daughter

it is he it is he nicholas said countess mary reentering the room
a few minutes later now our natásha has come to life you should have
seen her ecstasy and how he caught it for having stayed away so long
well come along now quick quick its time you two were parted she
added looking smilingly at the little girl who clung to her father

nicholas went out holding the child by the hand

countess mary remained in the sitting room

i should never never have believed that one could be so happy she
whispered to herself a smile lit up her face but at the same time she
sighed and her deep eyes expressed a quiet sadness as though she felt
through her happiness that there is another sort of happiness
unattainable in this life and of which she involuntarily thought at that
instant





chapter x

natásha had married in the early spring of  and in  already had
three daughters besides a son for whom she had longed and whom she was
now nursing she had grown stouter and broader so that it was difficult
to recognize in this robust motherly woman the slim lively natásha of
former days her features were more defined and had a calm soft and
serene expression in her face there was none of the everglowing
animation that had formerly burned there and constituted its charm now
her face and body were often all that one saw and her soul was not
visible at all all that struck the eye was a strong handsome and
fertile woman the old fire very rarely kindled in her face now that
happened only when as was the case that day her husband returned home
or a sick child was convalescent or when she and countess mary spoke of
prince andrew she never mentioned him to her husband who she imagined
was jealous of prince andrews memory or on the rare occasions when
something happened to induce her to sing a practice she had quite
abandoned since her marriage at the rare moments when the old fire did
kindle in her handsome fully developed body she was even more
attractive than in former days

since their marriage natásha and her husband had lived in moscow in
petersburg on their estate near moscow or with her mother that is to
say in nicholas house the young countess bezúkhova was not often seen
in society and those who met her there were not pleased with her and
found her neither attractive nor amiable not that natásha liked
solitudeshe did not know whether she liked it or not she even thought
that she did notbut with her pregnancies her confinements the nursing
of her children and sharing every moment of her husbands life she had
demands on her time which could be satisfied only by renouncing society
all who had known natásha before her marriage wondered at the change in
her as at something extraordinary only the old countess with her
maternal instinct had realized that all natáshas outbursts had been due
to her need of children and a husbandas she herself had once exclaimed
at otradnoe not so much in fun as in earnestand her mother was now
surprised at the surprise expressed by those who had never understood
natásha and she kept saying that she had always known that natásha
would make an exemplary wife and mother

only she lets her love of her husband and children overflow all
bounds said the countess so that it even becomes absurd

natásha did not follow the golden rule advocated by clever folk
especially by the french which says that a girl should not let herself
go when she marries should not neglect her accomplishments should be
even more careful of her appearance than when she was unmarried and
should fascinate her husband as much as she did before he became her
husband natásha on the contrary had at once abandoned all her witchery
of which her singing had been an unusually powerful part she gave it up
just because it was so powerfully seductive she took no pains with her
manners or with delicacy of speech or with her toilet or to show
herself to her husband in her most becoming attitudes or to avoid
inconveniencing him by being too exacting she acted in contradiction to
all those rules she felt that the allurements instinct had formerly
taught her to use would now be merely ridiculous in the eyes of her
husband to whom she had from the first moment given herself up
entirelythat is with her whole soul leaving no corner of it hidden
from him she felt that her unity with her husband was not maintained by
the poetic feelings that had attracted him to her but by something
elseindefinite but firm as the bond between her own body and soul

to fluff out her curls put on fashionable dresses and sing romantic
songs to fascinate her husband would have seemed as strange as to adorn
herself to attract herself to adorn herself for others might perhaps
have been agreeableshe did not knowbut she had no time at all for it
the chief reason for devoting no time either to singing to dress or to
choosing her words was that she really had no time to spare for these
things

we know that man has the faculty of becoming completely absorbed in a
subject however trivial it may be and that there is no subject so
trivial that it will not grow to infinite proportions if ones entire
attention is devoted to it

the subject which wholly engrossed natáshas attention was her family
that is her husband whom she had to keep so that he should belong
entirely to her and to the home and the children whom she had to bear
bring into the world nurse and bring up

and the deeper she penetrated not with her mind only but with her whole
soul her whole being into the subject that absorbed her the larger
did that subject grow and the weaker and more inadequate did her powers
appear so that she concentrated them wholly on that one thing and yet
was unable to accomplish all that she considered necessary

there were then as now conversations and discussions about womens
rights the relations of husband and wife and their freedom and rights
though these themes were not yet termed questions as they are now but
these topics were not merely uninteresting to natásha she positively
did not understand them

these questions then as now existed only for those who see nothing in
marriage but the pleasure married people get from one another that is
only the beginnings of marriage and not its whole significance which
lies in the family

discussions and questions of that kind which are like the question of
how to get the greatest gratification from ones dinner did not then
and do not now exist for those for whom the purpose of a dinner is the
nourishment it affords and the purpose of marriage is the family

if the purpose of dinner is to nourish the body a man who eats two
dinners at once may perhaps get more enjoyment but will not attain his
purpose for his stomach will not digest the two dinners

if the purpose of marriage is the family the person who wishes to have
many wives or husbands may perhaps obtain much pleasure but in that
case will not have a family

if the purpose of food is nourishment and the purpose of marriage is the
family the whole question resolves itself into not eating more than one
can digest and not having more wives or husbands than are needed for
the familythat is one wife or one husband natásha needed a husband a
husband was given her and he gave her a family and she not only saw no
need of any other or better husband but as all the powers of her soul
were intent on serving that husband and family she could not imagine
and saw no interest in imagining how it would be if things were
different

natásha did not care for society in general but prized the more the
society of her relativescountess mary and her brother her mother and
sónya she valued the company of those to whom she could come striding
disheveled from the nursery in her dressing gown and with joyful face
show a yellow instead of a green stain on babys napkin and from whom
she could hear reassuring words to the effect that baby was much better

to such an extent had natásha let herself go that the way she dressed
and did her hair her illchosen words and her jealousyshe was jealous
of sónya of the governess and of every woman pretty or plainwere
habitual subjects of jest to those about her the general opinion was
that pierre was under his wifes thumb which was really true from the
very first days of their married life natásha had announced her demands
pierre was greatly surprised by his wifes view to him a perfectly
novel one that every moment of his life belonged to her and to the
family his wifes demands astonished him but they also flattered him
and he submitted to them

pierres subjection consisted in the fact that he not only dared not
flirt with but dared not even speak smilingly to any other woman did
not dare dine at the club as a pastime did not dare spend money on a
whim and did not dare absent himself for any length of time except on
businessin which his wife included his intellectual pursuits which she
did not in the least understand but to which she attributed great
importance to make up for this at home pierre had the right to
regulate his life and that of the whole family exactly as he chose at
home natásha placed herself in the position of a slave to her husband
and the whole household went on tiptoe when he was occupiedthat is was
reading or writing in his study pierre had but to show a partiality for
anything to get just what he liked done always he had only to express a
wish and natásha would jump up and run to fulfill it

the entire household was governed according to pierres supposed orders
that is by his wishes which natásha tried to guess their way of life
and place of residence their acquaintances and ties natáshas
occupations the childrens upbringing were all selected not merely
with regard to pierres expressed wishes but to what natásha from the
thoughts he expressed in conversation supposed his wishes to be and she
deduced the essentials of his wishes quite correctly and having once
arrived at them clung to them tenaciously when pierre himself wanted to
change his mind she would fight him with his own weapons

thus in a time of trouble ever memorable to him after the birth of their
first child who was delicate when they had to change the wet nurse
three times and natásha fell ill from despair pierre one day told her
of rousseaus view with which he quite agreed that to have a wet nurse
is unnatural and harmful when her next baby was born despite the
opposition of her mother the doctors and even of her husband
himselfwho were all vigorously opposed to her nursing her baby herself
a thing then unheard of and considered injuriousshe insisted on having
her own way and after that nursed all her babies herself

it very often happened that in a moment of irritation husband and wife
would have a dispute but long afterwards pierre to his surprise and
delight would find in his wifes ideas and actions the very thought
against which she had argued but divested of everything superfluous
that in the excitement of the dispute he had added when expressing his
opinion

after seven years of marriage pierre had the joyous and firm
consciousness that he was not a bad man and he felt this because he saw
himself reflected in his wife he felt the good and bad within himself
inextricably mingled and overlapping but only what was really good in
him was reflected in his wife all that was not quite good was rejected
and this was not the result of logical reasoning but was a direct and
mysterious reflection





chapter xi

two months previously when pierre was already staying with the rostóvs
he had received a letter from prince theodore asking him to come to
petersburg to confer on some important questions that were being
discussed there by a society of which pierre was one of the principal
founders

on reading that letter she always read her husbands letters natásha
herself suggested that he should go to petersburg though she would feel
his absence very acutely she attributed immense importance to all her
husbands intellectual and abstract interests though she did not
understand them and she always dreaded being a hindrance to him in such
matters to pierres timid look of inquiry after reading the letter she
replied by asking him to go but to fix a definite date for his return
he was given four weeks leave of absence

ever since that leave of absence had expired more than a fortnight
before natásha had been in a constant state of alarm depression and
irritability

denisov now a general on the retired list and much dissatisfied with
the present state of affairs had arrived during that fortnight he
looked at natásha with sorrow and surprise as at a bad likeness of a
person once dear a dull dejected look random replies and talk about
the nursery was all he saw and heard from his former enchantress

natásha was sad and irritable all that time especially when her mother
her brother sónya or countess mary in their efforts to console her
tried to excuse pierre and suggested reasons for his delay in returning

its all nonsense all rubbishthose discussions which lead to nothing
and all those idiotic societies natásha declared of the very affairs
in the immense importance of which she firmly believed

and she would go to the nursery to nurse pétya her only boy no one
else could tell her anything so comforting or so reasonable as this
little threemonthold creature when he lay at her breast and she was
conscious of the movement of his lips and the snuffling of his little
nose that creature said you are angry you are jealous you would
like to pay him out you are afraidbut here am i and i am he and
that was unanswerable it was more than true

during that fortnight of anxiety natásha resorted to the baby for
comfort so often and fussed over him so much that she overfed him and
he fell ill she was terrified by his illness and yet that was just
what she needed while attending to him she bore the anxiety about her
husband more easily

she was nursing her boy when the sound of pierres sleigh was heard at
the front door and the old nurseknowing how to please her
mistressentered the room inaudibly but hurriedly and with a beaming
face

has he come natásha asked quickly in a whisper afraid to move lest
she should rouse the dozing baby

hes come maam whispered the nurse

the blood rushed to natáshas face and her feet involuntarily moved but
she could not jump up and run out the baby again opened his eyes and
looked at her youre here he seemed to be saying and again lazily
smacked his lips

cautiously withdrawing her breast natásha rocked him a little handed
him to the nurse and went with rapid steps toward the door but at the
door she stopped as if her conscience reproached her for having in her
joy left the child too soon and she glanced round the nurse with
raised elbows was lifting the infant over the rail of his cot

go maam dont worry go she whispered smiling with the kind of
familiarity that grows up between a nurse and her mistress

natásha ran with light footsteps to the anteroom

denisov who had come out of the study into the dancing room with his
pipe now for the first time recognized the old natásha a flood of
brilliant joyful light poured from her transfigured face

hes come she exclaimed as she ran past and denisov felt that he too
was delighted that pierre whom he did not much care for had returned

on reaching the vestibule natásha saw a tall figure in a fur coat
unwinding his scarf its he its really he he has come she said to
herself and rushing at him embraced him pressed his head to her
breast and then pushed him back and gazed at his ruddy happy face
covered with hoarfrost yes it is he happy and contented

then all at once she remembered the tortures of suspense she had
experienced for the last fortnight and the joy that had lit up her face
vanished she frowned and overwhelmed pierre with a torrent of
reproaches and angry words

yes its all very well for you you are pleased youve had a good
time but what about me you might at least have shown consideration
for the children i am nursing and my milk was spoiled pétya was at
deaths door but you were enjoying yourself yes enjoying

pierre knew he was not to blame for he could not have come sooner he
knew this outburst was unseemly and would blow over in a minute or two
above all he knew that he himself was bright and happy he wanted to
smile but dared not even think of doing so he made a piteous
frightened face and bent down

i could not on my honor but how is pétya

all right now come along i wonder youre not ashamed if only you
could see what i was like without you how i suffered

you are well

come come she said not letting go of his arm and they went to
their rooms

when nicholas and his wife came to look for pierre he was in the nursery
holding his baby son who was again awake on his huge right palm and
dandling him a blissful bright smile was fixed on the babys broad face
with its toothless open mouth the storm was long since over and there
was bright joyous sunshine on natáshas face as she gazed tenderly at
her husband and child

and have you talked everything well over with prince theodore she
asked

yes capitally

you see he holds it up she meant the babys head but how he did
frighten me youve seen the princess is it true shes in love with
that

yes just fancy

at that moment nicholas and countess mary came in pierre with the baby
on his hand stooped kissed them and replied to their inquiries but in
spite of much that was interesting and had to be discussed the baby
with the little cap on its unsteady head evidently absorbed all his
attention

how sweet said countess mary looking at and playing with the baby
now nicholas she added turning to her husband i cant understand
how it is you dont see the charm of these delicious marvels

i dont and cant replied nicholas looking coldly at the baby a
lump of flesh come along pierre

and yet hes such an affectionate father said countess mary
vindicating her husband but only after they are a year old or so

now pierre nurses them splendidly said natásha he says his hand is
just made for a babys seat just look

only not for this pierre suddenly exclaimed with a laugh and
shifting the baby he gave him to the nurse





chapter xii

as in every large household there were at bald hills several perfectly
distinct worlds which merged into one harmonious whole though each
retained its own peculiarities and made concessions to the others every
event joyful or sad that took place in that house was important to all
these worlds but each had its own special reasons to rejoice or grieve
over that occurrence independently of the others

for instance pierres return was a joyful and important event and they
all felt it to be so

the servantsthe most reliable judges of their masters because they
judge not by their conversation or expressions of feeling but by their
acts and way of lifewere glad of pierres return because they knew that
when he was there count nicholas would cease going every day to attend
to the estate and would be in better spirits and temper and also
because they would all receive handsome presents for the holidays

the children and their governesses were glad of pierres return because
no one else drew them into the social life of the household as he did
he alone could play on the clavichord that ecossaise his only piece to
which as he said all possible dances could be danced and they felt
sure he had brought presents for them all

young nicholas now a slim lad of fifteen delicate and intelligent
with curly lightbrown hair and beautiful eyes was delighted because
uncle pierre as he called him was the object of his rapturous and
passionate affection no one had instilled into him this love for pierre
whom he saw only occasionally countess mary who had brought him up had
done her utmost to make him love her husband as she loved him and
little nicholas did love his uncle but loved him with just a shade of
contempt pierre however he adored he did not want to be an hussar or
a knight of st george like his uncle nicholas he wanted to be learned
wise and kind like pierre in pierres presence his face always shone
with pleasure and he flushed and was breathless when pierre spoke to
him he did not miss a single word he uttered and would afterwards
with dessalles or by himself recall and reconsider the meaning of
everything pierre had said pierres past life and his unhappiness prior
to  of which young nicholas had formed a vague poetic picture from
some words he had overheard his adventures in moscow his captivity
platon karataev of whom he had heard from pierre his love for natásha
of whom the lad was also particularly fond and especially pierres
friendship with the father whom nicholas could not rememberall this
made pierre in his eyes a hero and a saint

from broken remarks about natásha and his father from the emotion with
which pierre spoke of that dead father and from the careful reverent
tenderness with which natásha spoke of him the boy who was only just
beginning to guess what love is derived the notion that his father had
loved natásha and when dying had left her to his friend but the father
whom the boy did not remember appeared to him a divinity who could not
be pictured and of whom he never thought without a swelling heart and
tears of sadness and rapture so the boy also was happy that pierre had
arrived

the guests welcomed pierre because he always helped to enliven and unite
any company he was in

the grownup members of the family not to mention his wife were
pleased to have back a friend whose presence made life run more smoothly
and peacefully

the old ladies were pleased with the presents he brought them and
especially that natásha would now be herself again

pierre felt the different outlooks of these various worlds and made
haste to satisfy all their expectations

though the most absentminded and forgetful of men pierre with the aid
of a list his wife drew up had now bought everything not forgetting
his motherand brotherinlaws commissions nor the dress material for
a present to belova nor toys for his wifes nephews in the early days
of his marriage it had seemed strange to him that his wife should expect
him not to forget to procure all the things he undertook to buy and he
had been taken aback by her serious annoyance when on his first trip he
forgot everything but in time he grew used to this demand knowing that
natásha asked nothing for herself and gave him commissions for others
only when he himself had offered to undertake them he now found an
unexpected and childlike pleasure in this purchase of presents for
everyone in the house and never forgot anything if he now incurred
natáshas censure it was only for buying too many and too expensive
things to her other defects as most people thought them but which to
pierre were qualities of untidiness and neglect of herself she now
added stinginess

from the time that pierre began life as a family man on a footing
entailing heavy expenditure he had noticed to his surprise that he
spent only half as much as before and that his affairswhich had been
in disorder of late chiefly because of his first wifes debtshad begun
to improve

life was cheaper because it was circumscribed that most expensive
luxury the kind of life that can be changed at any moment was no
longer his nor did he wish for it he felt that his way of life had now
been settled once for all till death and that to change it was not in
his power and so that way of life proved economical

with a merry smiling face pierre was sorting his purchases

what do you think of this said he unrolling a piece of stuff like a
shopman

natásha who was sitting opposite to him with her eldest daughter on her
lap turned her sparkling eyes swiftly from her husband to the things he
showed her

thats for belova excellent she felt the quality of the material
it was a ruble an arshin i suppose

pierre told her the price

too dear natásha remarked how pleased the children will be and
mamma too only you need not have bought me this she added unable to
suppress a smile as she gazed admiringly at a gold comb set with pearls
of a kind then just coming into fashion

adele tempted me she kept on telling me to buy it returned pierre

when am i to wear it and natásha stuck it in her coil of hair when
i take little másha into society perhaps they will be fashionable again
by then well lets go now

and collecting the presents they went first to the nursery and then to
the old countess rooms

the countess was sitting with her companion belova playing grand
patience as usual when pierre and natásha came into the drawing room
with parcels under their arms

the countess was now over sixty was quite gray and wore a cap with a
frill that surrounded her face her face had shriveled her upper lip
had sunk in and her eyes were dim

after the deaths of her son and husband in such rapid succession she
felt herself a being accidentally forgotten in this world and left
without aim or object for her existence she ate drank slept or kept
awake but did not live life gave her no new impressions she wanted
nothing from life but tranquillity and that tranquillity only death
could give her but until death came she had to go on living that is
to use her vital forces a peculiarity one sees in very young children
and very old people was particularly evident in her her life had no
external aimsonly a need to exercise her various functions and
inclinations was apparent she had to eat sleep think speak weep
work give vent to her anger and so on merely because she had a
stomach a brain muscles nerves and a liver she did these things not
under any external impulse as people in the full vigor of life do when
behind the purpose for which they strive that of exercising their
functions remains unnoticed she talked only because she physically
needed to exercise her tongue and lungs she cried as a child does
because her nose had to be cleared and so on what for people in their
full vigor is an aim was for her evidently merely a pretext

thus in the morningespecially if she had eaten anything rich the day
beforeshe felt a need of being angry and would choose as the handiest
pretext belovas deafness

she would begin to say something to her in a low tone from the other end
of the room

it seems a little warmer today my dear she would murmur

and when belova replied oh yes theyve come she would mutter
angrily o lord how stupid and deaf she is

another pretext would be her snuff which would seem too dry or too damp
or not rubbed fine enough after these fits of irritability her face
would grow yellow and her maids knew by infallible symptoms when belova
would again be deaf the snuff damp and the countess face yellow just
as she needed to work off her spleen so she had sometimes to exercise
her stillexisting faculty of thinkingand the pretext for that was a
game of patience when she needed to cry the deceased count would be
the pretext when she wanted to be agitated nicholas and his health
would be the pretext and when she felt a need to speak spitefully the
pretext would be countess mary when her vocal organs needed exercise
which was usually toward seven oclock when she had had an afterdinner
rest in a darkened room the pretext would be the retelling of the same
stories over and over again to the same audience

the old ladys condition was understood by the whole household though no
one ever spoke of it and they all made every possible effort to satisfy
her needs only by a rare glance exchanged with a sad smile between
nicholas pierre natásha and countess mary was the common
understanding of her condition expressed

but those glances expressed something more they said that she had
played her part in life that what they now saw was not her whole self
that we must all become like her and that they were glad to yield to
her to restrain themselves for this once precious being formerly as
full of life as themselves but now so much to be pitied memento
mori said these glances

only the really heartless the stupid ones of that household and the
little children failed to understand this and avoided her





chapter xiii

when pierre and his wife entered the drawing room the countess was in
one of her customary states in which she needed the mental exertion of
playing patience and sothough by force of habit she greeted him with
the words she always used when pierre or her son returned after an
absence high time my dear high time we were all weary of waiting
for you well thank god and received her presents with another
customary remark its not the gift thats precious my dear but that
you give it to me an old womanyet it was evident that she was not
pleased by pierres arrival at that moment when it diverted her
attention from the unfinished game

she finished her game of patience and only then examined the presents
they consisted of a box for cards of splendid workmanship a bright
blue sevres tea cup with shepherdesses depicted on it and with a lid
and a gold snuffbox with the counts portrait on the lid which pierre
had had done by a miniaturist in petersburg the countess had long
wished for such a box but as she did not want to cry just then she
glanced indifferently at the portrait and gave her attention chiefly to
the box for cards

thank you my dear you have cheered me up said she as she always
did but best of all you have brought yourself backfor i never saw
anything like it you ought to give your wife a scolding what are we to
do with her she is like a mad woman when you are away doesnt see
anything doesnt remember anything she went on repeating her usual
phrases look anna timofeevna she added to her companion see what
a box for cards my son has brought us

belova admired the presents and was delighted with her dress material

though pierre natásha nicholas countess mary and denisov had much to
talk about that they could not discuss before the old countessnot that
anything was hidden from her but because she had dropped so far
behindhand in many things that had they begun to converse in her
presence they would have had to answer inopportune questions and to
repeat what they had already told her many times that soandso was
dead and soandso was married which she would again be unable to
rememberyet they sat at tea round the samovar in the drawing room from
habit and pierre answered the countess questions as to whether prince
vasíli had aged and whether countess mary alexeevna had sent greetings
and still thought of them and other matters that interested no one and
to which she herself was indifferent

conversation of this kind interesting to no one yet unavoidable
continued all through teatime all the grownup members of the family
were assembled near the round tea table at which sónya presided beside
the samovar the children with their tutors and governesses had had tea
and their voices were audible from the next room at tea all sat in
their accustomed places nicholas beside the stove at a small table
where his tea was handed to him milka the old gray borzoi bitch
daughter of the first milka with a quite gray face and large black
eyes that seemed more prominent than ever lay on the armchair beside
him denisov whose curly hair mustache and whiskers had turned half
gray sat beside countess mary with his generals tunic unbuttoned
pierre sat between his wife and the old countess he spoke of what he
knew might interest the old lady and that she could understand he told
her of external social events and of the people who had formed the
circle of her contemporaries and had once been a real living and
distinct group but who were now for the most part scattered about the
world and like herself were garnering the last ears of the harvests they
had sown in earlier years but to the old countess those contemporaries
of hers seemed to be the only serious and real society natásha saw by
pierres animation that his visit had been interesting and that he had
much to tell them but dare not say it before the old countess denisov
not being a member of the family did not understand pierres caution
and being as a malcontent much interested in what was occurring in
petersburg kept urging pierre to tell them about what had happened in
the semënovsk regiment then about arakcheev and then about the bible
society once or twice pierre was carried away and began to speak of
these things but nicholas and natásha always brought him back to the
health of prince ivan and countess mary alexeevna

well and all this idiocygossner and tatawinova denisov asked is
that weally still going on

going on pierre exclaimed why more than ever the bible society is
the whole government now

what is that mon cher ami asked the countess who had finished her
tea and evidently needed a pretext for being angry after her meal what
are you saying about the government i dont understand

well you know maman nicholas interposed knowing how to translate
things into his mothers language prince alexander golítsyn has
founded a society and in consequence has great influence they say

arakcheev and golítsyn incautiously remarked pierre are now the
whole government and what a government they see treason everywhere and
are afraid of everything

well and how is prince alexander to blame he is a most estimable man
i used to meet him at mary antonovnas said the countess in an
offended tone and still more offended that they all remained silent
she went on nowadays everyone finds fault a gospel society well and
what harm is there in that and she rose everybody else got up too
and with a severe expression sailed back to her table in the sitting
room

the melancholy silence that followed was broken by the sounds of the
childrens voices and laughter from the next room evidently some jolly
excitement was going on there

finished finished little natáshas gleeful yell rose above them all

pierre exchanged glances with countess mary and nicholas natásha he
never lost sight of and smiled happily

thats delightful music said he

it means that anna makarovna has finished her stocking said countess
mary

oh ill go and see said pierre jumping up you know he added
stopping at the door why im especially fond of that music it is
always the first thing that tells me all is well when i was driving
here today the nearer i got to the house the more anxious i grew as i
entered the anteroom i heard andrúshas peals of laughter and that meant
that all was well

i know i know that feeling said nicholas but i mustnt go
therethose stockings are to be a surprise for me

pierre went to the children and the shouting and laughter grew still
louder

come anna makarovna pierres voice was heard saying come here into
the middle of the room and at the word of command one two and when
i say three you stand here and you in my armswell now one
two said pierre and a silence followed three and a rapturously
breathless cry of childrens voices filled the room two two they
shouted

this meant two stockings which by a secret process known only to
herself anna makarovna used to knit at the same time on the same
needles and which when they were ready she always triumphantly drew
one out of the other in the childrens presence





chapter xiv

soon after this the children came in to say good night they kissed
everyone the tutors and governesses made their bows and they went out
only young nicholas and his tutor remained dessalles whispered to the
boy to come downstairs

no monsieur dessalles i will ask my aunt to let me stay replied
nicholas bolkónski also in a whisper

ma tante please let me stay said he going up to his aunt

his face expressed entreaty agitation and ecstasy countess mary
glanced at him and turned to pierre

when you are here he cant tear himself away she said

i will bring him to you directly monsieur dessalles good night said
pierre giving his hand to the swiss tutor and he turned to young
nicholas with a smile you and i havent seen anything of one another
yet how like he is growing mary he added addressing countess
mary

like my father asked the boy flushing crimson and looking up at
pierre with bright ecstatic eyes

pierre nodded and went on with what he had been saying when the
children had interrupted countess mary sat down doing woolwork natásha
did not take her eyes off her husband nicholas and denisov rose asked
for their pipes smoked went to fetch more tea from sónyawho sat weary
but resolute at the samovarand questioned pierre the curlyheaded
delicate boy sat with shining eyes unnoticed in a corner starting every
now and then and muttering something to himself and evidently
experiencing a new and powerful emotion as he turned his curly head
with his thin neck exposed by his turndown collar toward the place
where pierre sat

the conversation turned on the contemporary gossip about those in power
in which most people see the chief interest of home politics denisov
dissatisfied with the government on account of his own disappointments
in the service heard with pleasure of the things done in petersburg
which seemed to him stupid and made forcible and sharp comments on what
pierre told them

one used to have to be a germannow one must dance with tatawinova and
madame kwudener and wead eckatshausen and the bwethwen oh they
should let that fine fellow bonaparte loosehed knock all this nonsense
out of them fancy giving the command of the semënov wegiment to a
fellow like that schwatz he cried

nicholas though free from denisovs readiness to find fault with
everything also thought that discussion of the government was a very
serious and weighty matter and the fact that a had been appointed
minister of this and b governor general of that and that the emperor
had said soandso and this minister soandso seemed to him very
important and so he thought it necessary to take an interest in these
things and to question pierre the questions put by these two kept the
conversation from changing its ordinary character of gossip about the
higher government circles

but natásha knowing all her husbands ways and ideas saw that he had
long been wishing but had been unable to divert the conversation to
another channel and express his own deeply felt idea for the sake of
which he had gone to petersburg to consult with his new friend prince
theodore and she helped him by asking how his affairs with prince
theodore had gone

what was it about asked nicholas

always the same thing said pierre looking round at his listeners
everybody sees that things are going so badly that they cannot be
allowed to go on so and that it is the duty of all decent men to
counteract it as far as they can

what can decent men do nicholas inquired frowning slightly what
can be done

why this

come into my study said nicholas

natásha who had long expected to be fetched to nurse her baby now
heard the nurse calling her and went to the nursery countess mary
followed her the men went into the study and little nicholas bolkónski
followed them unnoticed by his uncle and sat down at the writing table
in a shady corner by the window

well what would you do asked denisov

always some fantastic schemes said nicholas

why this began pierre not sitting down but pacing the room
sometimes stopping short gesticulating and lisping the position in
petersburg is this the emperor does not look into anything he has
abandoned himself altogether to this mysticism pierre could not
tolerate mysticism in anyone now he seeks only for peace and only
these people sans foi ni loi  can give it himpeople who recklessly
hack at and strangle everythingmagnitski arakcheev and tutti
quanti you will agree that if you did not look after your estates
yourself but only wanted a quiet life the harsher your steward was the
more readily your object might be attained he said to nicholas

 without faith or law

well what does that lead up to said nicholas

well everything is going to ruin robbery in the law courts in the
army nothing but flogging drilling and military settlements the
people are tortured enlightenment is suppressed all that is young and
honest is crushed everyone sees that this cannot go on everything is
strained to such a degree that it will certainly break said pierre as
those who examine the actions of any government have always said since
governments began i told them just one thing in petersburg

told whom

well you know whom said pierre with a meaning glance from under his
brows prince theodore and all those to encourage culture and
philanthropy is all very well of course the aim is excellent but in the
present circumstances something else is needed

at that moment nicholas noticed the presence of his nephew his face
darkened and he went up to the boy

why are you here

why let him be said pierre taking nicholas by the arm and
continuing that is not enough i told them something else is needed
when you stand expecting the overstrained string to snap at any moment
when everyone is expecting the inevitable catastrophe as many as
possible must join hands as closely as they can to withstand the general
calamity everything that is young and strong is being enticed away and
depraved one is lured by women another by honors a third by ambition
or money and they go over to that camp no independent men such as you
or i are left what i say is widen the scope of our society let the
mot dordre be not virtue alone but independence and action as well

nicholas who had left his nephew irritably pushed up an armchair sat
down in it and listened to pierre coughing discontentedly and frowning
more and more

but action with what aim he cried and what position will you adopt
toward the government

why the position of assistants the society need not be secret if the
government allows it not merely is it not hostile to government but it
is a society of true conservativesa society of gentlemen in the full
meaning of that word it is only to prevent some pugachev or other from
killing my children and yours and arakcheev from sending me off to some
military settlement we join hands only for the public welfare and the
general safety

yes but its a secret society and therefore a hostile and harmful one
which can only cause harm

why did the tugendbund which saved europe they did not then venture
to suggest that russia had saved europe do any harm the tugendbund is
an alliance of virtue it is love mutual help it is what christ
preached on the cross

natásha who had come in during the conversation looked joyfully at her
husband it was not what he was saying that pleased herthat did not
even interest her for it seemed to her that was all extremely simple
and that she had known it a long time it seemed so to her because she
knew that it sprang from pierres whole soul but it was his animated
and enthusiastic appearance that made her glad

the boy with the thin neck stretching out from the turndown collarwhom
everyone had forgottengazed at pierre with even greater and more
rapturous joy every word of pierres burned into his heart and with a
nervous movement of his fingers he unconsciously broke the sealing wax
and quill pens his hands came upon on his uncles table

it is not at all what you suppose but that is what the german
tugendbund was and what i am proposing

no my fwiend the tugendbund is all vewy well for the sausage eaters
but i dont understand it and cant even pwonounce it interposed
denisov in a loud and resolute voice i agwee that evewything here is
wotten and howwible but the tugendbund i dont understand if were not
satisfied let us have a bunt of our own thats all wight je suis
vote homme

 im your man

pierre smiled natásha began to laugh but nicholas knitted his brows
still more and began proving to pierre that there was no prospect of any
great change and that all the danger he spoke of existed only in his
imagination pierre maintained the contrary and as his mental faculties
were greater and more resourceful nicholas felt himself cornered this
made him still angrier for he was fully convinced not by reasoning but
by something within him stronger than reason of the justice of his
opinion

i will tell you this he said rising and trying with nervously
twitching fingers to prop up his pipe in a corner but finally
abandoning the attempt i cant prove it to you you say that
everything here is rotten and that an overthrow is coming i dont see
it but you also say that our oath of allegiance is a conditional
matter and to that i reply you are my best friend as you know but
if you formed a secret society and began working against the
governmentbe it what it mayi know it is my duty to obey the
government and if arakcheev ordered me to lead a squadron against you
and cut you down i should not hesitate an instant but should do it
and you may argue about that as you like

an awkward silence followed these words natásha was the first to speak
defending her husband and attacking her brother her defense was weak
and inapt but she attained her object the conversation was resumed and
no longer in the unpleasantly hostile tone of nicholas last remark

when they all got up to go in to supper little nicholas bolkónski went
up to pierre pale and with shining radiant eyes

uncle pierre you no if papa were alive would he agree with
you he asked

and pierre suddenly realized what a special independent complex and
powerful process of thought and feeling must have been going on in this
boy during that conversation and remembering all he had said he
regretted that the lad should have heard him he had however to give
him an answer

yes i think so he said reluctantly and left the study

the lad looked down and seemed now for the first time to notice what he
had done to the things on the table he flushed and went up to nicholas

uncle forgive me i did that unintentionally he said pointing to
the broken sealing wax and pens

nicholas started angrily

all right all right he said throwing the bits under the table

and evidently suppressing his vexation with difficulty he turned away
from the boy

you ought not to have been here at all he said





chapter xv

the conversation at supper was not about politics or societies but
turned on the subject nicholas liked bestrecollections of  denisov
started these and pierre was particularly agreeable and amusing about
them the family separated on the most friendly terms

after supper nicholas having undressed in his study and given
instructions to the steward who had been waiting for him went to the
bedroom in his dressing gown where he found his wife still at her
table writing

what are you writing mary nicholas asked

countess mary blushed she was afraid that what she was writing would
not be understood or approved by her husband

she had wanted to conceal what she was writing from him but at the same
time was glad he had surprised her at it and that she would now have to
tell him

a diary nicholas she replied handing him a blue exercise book
filled with her firm bold writing

a diary nicholas repeated with a shade of irony and he took up the
book

it was in french

december  today when andrúsha her eldest boy woke up he did not wish
to dress and mademoiselle louise sent for me he was naughty and
obstinate i tried threats but he only grew angrier then i took the
matter in hand i left him alone and began with nurses help to get the
other children up telling him that i did not love him for a long time
he was silent as if astonished then he jumped out of bed ran to me in
his shirt and sobbed so that i could not calm him for a long time it
was plain that what troubled him most was that he had grieved me
afterwards in the evening when i gave him his ticket he again began
crying piteously and kissing me one can do anything with him by
tenderness

what is a ticket nicholas inquired

i have begun giving the elder ones marks every evening showing how
they have behaved

nicholas looked into the radiant eyes that were gazing at him and
continued to turn over the pages and read in the diary was set down
everything in the childrens lives that seemed noteworthy to their
mother as showing their characters or suggesting general reflections on
educational methods they were for the most part quite insignificant
trifles but did not seem so to the mother or to the father either now
that he read this diary about his children for the first time

under the date  was entered

mitya was naughty at table papa said he was to have no pudding he had
none but looked so unhappily and greedily at the others while they were
eating i think that punishment by depriving children of sweets only
develops their greediness must tell nicholas this

nicholas put down the book and looked at his wife the radiant eyes
gazed at him questioningly would he approve or disapprove of her diary
there could be no doubt not only of his approval but also of his
admiration for his wife

perhaps it need not be done so pedantically thought nicholas or even
done at all but this untiring continual spiritual effort of which the
sole aim was the childrens moral welfare delighted him had nicholas
been able to analyze his feelings he would have found that his steady
tender and proud love of his wife rested on his feeling of wonder at
her spirituality and at the lofty moral world almost beyond his reach
in which she had her being

he was proud of her intelligence and goodness recognized his own
insignificance beside her in the spiritual world and rejoiced all the
more that she with such a soul not only belonged to him but was part of
himself

i quite quite approve my dearest said he with a significant look
and after a short pause he added and i behaved badly today you
werent in the study we began disputingpierre and iand i lost my
temper but he is impossible such a child i dont know what would
become of him if natásha didnt keep him in hand have you any idea
why he went to petersburg they have formed

yes i know said countess mary natásha told me

well then you know nicholas went on growing hot at the mere
recollection of their discussion he wanted to convince me that it is
every honest mans duty to go against the government and that the oath
of allegiance and duty i am sorry you werent there they all fell on
medenisov and natásha natásha is absurd how she rules over him and
yet there need only be a discussion and she has no words of her own but
only repeats his sayings added nicholas yielding to that
irresistible inclination which tempts us to judge those nearest and
dearest to us he forgot that what he was saying about natásha could
have been applied word for word to himself in relation to his wife

yes i have noticed that said countess mary

when i told him that duty and the oath were above everything he
started proving goodness knows what a pity you were not therewhat
would you have said

as i see it you were quite right and i told natásha so pierre says
everybody is suffering tortured and being corrupted and that it is
our duty to help our neighbor of course he is right there said
countess mary but he forgets that we have other duties nearer to us
duties indicated to us by god himself and that though we might expose
ourselves to risks we must not risk our children

yes thats it thats just what i said to him put in nicholas who
fancied he really had said it but they insisted on their own view
love of ones neighbor and christianityand all this in the presence of
young nicholas who had gone into my study and broke all my things

ah nicholas do you know i am often troubled about little nicholas
said countess mary he is such an exceptional boy i am afraid i
neglect him in favor of my own we all have children and relations while
he has no one he is constantly alone with his thoughts

well i dont think you need reproach yourself on his account all that
the fondest mother could do for her son you have done and are doing for
him and of course i am glad of it he is a fine lad a fine lad this
evening he listened to pierre in a sort of trance and fancyas we were
going in to supper i looked and he had broken everything on my table to
bits and he told me of it himself at once i never knew him to tell an
untruth a fine lad a fine lad repeated nicholas who at heart was
not fond of nicholas bolkónski but was always anxious to recognize that
he was a fine lad

still i am not the same as his own mother said countess mary i
feel i am not the same and it troubles me a wonderful boy but i am
dreadfully afraid for him it would be good for him to have companions

well it wont be for long next summer ill take him to petersburg
said nicholas yes pierre always was a dreamer and always will be he
continued returning to the talk in the study which had evidently
disturbed him well what business is it of mine what goes on
therewhether arakcheev is bad and all that what business was it of
mine when i married and was so deep in debt that i was threatened with
prison and had a mother who could not see or understand it and then
there are you and the children and our affairs is it for my own
pleasure that i am at the farm or in the office from morning to night
no but i know i must work to comfort my mother to repay you and not
to leave the children such beggars as i was

countess mary wanted to tell him that man does not live by bread alone
and that he attached too much importance to these matters but she knew
she must not say this and that it would be useless to do so she only
took his hand and kissed it he took this as a sign of approval and a
confirmation of his thoughts and after a few minutes reflection
continued to think aloud

you know mary today elias mitrofanych this was his overseer came
back from the tambov estate and told me they are already offering eighty
thousand rubles for the forest

and with an eager face nicholas began to speak of the possibility of
repurchasing otradnoe before long and added another ten years of life
and i shall leave the children in an excellent position

countess mary listened to her husband and understood all that he told
her she knew that when he thought aloud in this way he would sometimes
ask her what he had been saying and be vexed if he noticed that she had
been thinking about something else but she had to force herself to
attend for what he was saying did not interest her at all she looked
at him and did not think but felt about something different she felt
a submissive tender love for this man who would never understand all
that she understood and this seemed to make her love for him still
stronger and added a touch of passionate tenderness besides this
feeling which absorbed her altogether and hindered her from following
the details of her husbands plans thoughts that had no connection with
what he was saying flitted through her mind she thought of her nephew
her husbands account of the boys agitation while pierre was speaking
struck her forcibly and various traits of his gentle sensitive
character recurred to her mind and while thinking of her nephew she
thought also of her own children she did not compare them with him but
compared her feeling for them with her feeling for him and felt with
regret that there was something lacking in her feeling for young
nicholas

sometimes it seemed to her that this difference arose from the
difference in their ages but she felt herself to blame toward him and
promised in her heart to do better and to accomplish the impossiblein
this life to love her husband her children little nicholas and all
her neighbors as christ loved mankind countess marys soul always
strove toward the infinite the eternal and the absolute and could
therefore never be at peace a stern expression of the lofty secret
suffering of a soul burdened by the body appeared on her face nicholas
gazed at her o god what will become of us if she dies as i always
fear when her face is like that thought he and placing himself before
the icon he began to say his evening prayers





chapter xvi

natásha and pierre left alone also began to talk as only a husband and
wife can talk that is with extraordinary clearness and rapidity
understanding and expressing each others thoughts in ways contrary to
all rules of logic without premises deductions or conclusions and in
a quite peculiar way natásha was so used to this kind of talk with her
husband that for her it was the surest sign of something being wrong
between them if pierre followed a line of logical reasoning when he
began proving anything or talking argumentatively and calmly and she
led on by his example began to do the same she knew that they were on
the verge of a quarrel

from the moment they were alone and natásha came up to him with wide
open happy eyes and quickly seizing his head pressed it to her bosom
saying now you are all mine mine you wont escapefrom that moment
this conversation began contrary to all the laws of logic and contrary
to them because quite different subjects were talked about at one and
the same time this simultaneous discussion of many topics did not
prevent a clear understanding but on the contrary was the surest sign
that they fully understood one another

just as in a dream when all is uncertain unreasoning and
contradictory except the feeling that guides the dream so in this
intercourse contrary to all laws of reason the words themselves were
not consecutive and clear but only the feeling that prompted them

natásha spoke to pierre about her brothers life and doings of how she
had suffered and lacked life during his own absence and of how she was
fonder than ever of mary and how mary was in every way better than
herself in saying this natásha was sincere in acknowledging marys
superiority but at the same time by saying it she made a demand on
pierre that he should all the same prefer her to mary and to all other
women and that now especially after having seen many women in
petersburg he should tell her so afresh

pierre answering natáshas words told her how intolerable it had been
for him to meet ladies at dinners and balls in petersburg

i have quite lost the knack of talking to ladies he said it was
simply dull besides i was very busy

natásha looked intently at him and went on

mary is so splendid she said how she understands children it is as
if she saw straight into their souls yesterday for instance mitya was
naughty

how like his father he is pierre interjected

natásha knew why he mentioned mityas likeness to nicholas the
recollection of his dispute with his brotherinlaw was unpleasant and
he wanted to know what natásha thought of it

nicholas has the weakness of never agreeing with anything not generally
accepted but i understand that you value what opens up a fresh line
said she repeating words pierre had once uttered

no the chief point is that to nicholas ideas and discussions are an
amusementalmost a pastime said pierre for instance he is
collecting a library and has made it a rule not to buy a new book till
he has read what he had already boughtsismondi and rousseau and
montesquieu he added with a smile you know how much i he began
to soften down what he had said but natásha interrupted him to show
that this was unnecessary

so you say ideas are an amusement to him

yes and for me nothing else is serious all the time in petersburg i
saw everyone as in a dream when i am taken up by a thought all else is
mere amusement

ah im so sorry i wasnt there when you met the children said
natásha which was most delighted lisa im sure

yes pierre replied and went on with what was in his mind nicholas
says we ought not to think but i cant help it besides when i was in
petersburg i felt i can say this to you that the whole affair would go
to pieces without meeveryone was pulling his own way but i succeeded
in uniting them all and then my idea is so clear and simple you see i
dont say that we ought to oppose this and that we may be mistaken
what i say is join hands you who love the right and let there be but
one bannerthat of active virtue prince sergey is a fine fellow and
clever

natásha would have had no doubt as to the greatness of pierres idea
but one thing disconcerted her can a man so important and necessary to
society be also my husband how did this happen she wished to express
this doubt to him now who could decide whether he is really cleverer
than all the others she asked herself and passed in review all those
whom pierre most respected judging by what he had said there was no one
he had respected so highly as platon karataev

do you know what i am thinking about she asked about platon
karataev would he have approved of you now do you think

pierre was not at all surprised at this question he understood his
wifes line of thought

platon karataev he repeated and pondered evidently sincerely trying
to imagine karataevs opinion on the subject he would not have
understood yet perhaps he would

i love you awfully natásha suddenly said awfully awfully

no he would not have approved said pierre after reflection what
he would have approved of is our family life he was always so anxious
to find seemliness happiness and peace in everything and i should
have been proud to let him see us there nowyou talk of my absence but
you wouldnt believe what a special feeling i have for you after a
separation

yes i should think natásha began

no its not that i never leave off loving you and one couldnt love
more but this is something special yes of course he did not
finish because their eyes meeting said the rest

what nonsense it is natásha suddenly exclaimed about honeymoons
and that the greatest happiness is at first on the contrary now is the
best of all if only you did not go away do you remember how we
quarreled and it was always my fault always mine and what we
quarreled abouti dont even remember

always about the same thing said pierre with a smile jealo

dont say it i cant bear it natásha cried and her eyes glittered
coldly and vindictively did you see her she added after a pause

no and if i had i shouldnt have recognized her

they were silent for a while

oh do you know while you were talking in the study i was looking at
you natásha began evidently anxious to disperse the cloud that had
come over them you are as like him as two peaslike the boy she
meant her little son oh its time to go to him the milks
come but im sorry to leave you

they were silent for a few seconds then suddenly turning to one another
at the same time they both began to speak pierre began with self
satisfaction and enthusiasm natásha with a quiet happy smile having
interrupted one another they both stopped to let the other continue

no what did you say go on go on

no you go on i was talking nonsense said natásha

pierre finished what he had begun it was the sequel to his complacent
reflections on his success in petersburg at that moment it seemed to
him that he was chosen to give a new direction to the whole of russian
society and to the whole world

i only wished to say that ideas that have great results are always
simple ones my whole idea is that if vicious people are united and
constitute a power then honest folk must do the same now thats simple
enough

yes

and what were you going to say

i only nonsense

but all the same

oh nothing only a trifle said natásha smilingly still more
brightly i only wanted to tell you about pétya today nurse was coming
to take him from me and he laughed shut his eyes and clung to me im
sure he thought he was hiding awfully sweet there now hes crying
well goodby and she left the room

meanwhile downstairs in young nicholas bolkónskis bedroom a little lamp
was burning as usual the boy was afraid of the dark and they could not
cure him of it dessalles slept propped up on four pillows and his
roman nose emitted sounds of rhythmic snoring little nicholas who had
just waked up in a cold perspiration sat up in bed and gazed before him
with wideopen eyes he had awaked from a terrible dream he had dreamed
that he and uncle pierre wearing helmets such as were depicted in his
plutarch were leading a huge army the army was made up of white
slanting lines that filled the air like the cobwebs that float about in
autumn and which dessalles called les fils de la vierge in front was
glory which was similar to those threads but rather thicker he and
pierre were borne along lightly and joyously nearer and nearer to their
goal suddenly the threads that moved them began to slacken and become
entangled and it grew difficult to move and uncle nicholas stood before
them in a stern and threatening attitude

have you done this he said pointing to some broken sealing wax and
pens i loved you but i have orders from arakcheev and will kill the
first of you who moves forward little nicholas turned to look at
pierre but pierre was no longer there in his place was his
fatherprince andrewand his father had neither shape nor form but he
existed and when little nicholas perceived him he grew faint with love
he felt himself powerless limp and formless his father caressed and
pitied him but uncle nicholas came nearer and nearer to them terror
seized young nicholas and he awoke

my father he thought though there were two good portraits of prince
andrew in the house nicholas never imagined him in human form my
father has been with me and caressed me he approved of me and of uncle
pierre whatever he may tell me i will do it mucius scaevola burned
his hand why should not the same sort of thing happen to me i know
they want me to learn and i will learn but someday i shall have
finished learning and then i will do something i only pray god that
something may happen to me such as happened to plutarchs men and i
will act as they did i will do better everyone shall know me love me
and be delighted with me and suddenly his bosom heaved with sobs and
he began to cry

are you ill he heard dessalles voice asking

no answered nicholas and lay back on his pillow

he is good and kind and i am fond of him he thought of dessalles
but uncle pierre oh what a wonderful man he is and my father oh
father father yes i will do something with which even he would be
satisfied





second epilogue





chapter i

history is the life of nations and of humanity to seize and put into
words to describe directly the life of humanity or even of a single
nation appears impossible

the ancient historians all employed one and the same method to describe
and seize the apparently elusivethe life of a people they described
the activity of individuals who ruled the people and regarded the
activity of those men as representing the activity of the whole nation

the question how did individuals make nations act as they wished and by
what was the will of these individuals themselves guided the ancients
met by recognizing a divinity which subjected the nations to the will of
a chosen man and guided the will of that chosen man so as to accomplish
ends that were predestined

for the ancients these questions were solved by a belief in the direct
participation of the deity in human affairs

modern history in theory rejects both these principles

it would seem that having rejected the belief of the ancients in mans
subjection to the deity and in a predetermined aim toward which nations
are led modern history should study not the manifestations of power but
the causes that produce it but modern history has not done this having
in theory rejected the view held by the ancients it still follows them
in practice

instead of men endowed with divine authority and directly guided by the
will of god modern history has given us either heroes endowed with
extraordinary superhuman capacities or simply men of very various
kinds from monarchs to journalists who lead the masses instead of the
former divinely appointed aims of the jewish greek or roman nations
which ancient historians regarded as representing the progress of
humanity modern history has postulated its own aimsthe welfare of the
french german or english people or in its highest abstraction the
welfare and civilization of humanity in general by which is usually
meant that of the peoples occupying a small northwesterly portion of a
large continent

modern history has rejected the beliefs of the ancients without
replacing them by a new conception and the logic of the situation has
obliged the historians after they had apparently rejected the divine
authority of the kings and the fate of the ancients to reach the same
conclusion by another road that is to recognize  nations guided by
individual men and  the existence of a known aim to which these
nations and humanity at large are tending

at the basis of the works of all the modern historians from gibbon to
buckle despite their seeming disagreements and the apparent novelty of
their outlooks lie those two old unavoidable assumptions

in the first place the historian describes the activity of individuals
who in his opinion have directed humanity one historian considers only
monarchs generals and ministers as being such men while another
includes also orators learned men reformers philosophers and poets
secondly it is assumed that the goal toward which humanity is being led
is known to the historians to one of them this goal is the greatness of
the roman spanish or french realm to another it is liberty equality
and a certain kind of civilization of a small corner of the world called
europe

in  a ferment arises in paris it grows spreads and is expressed
by a movement of peoples from west to east several times it moves
eastward and collides with a countermovement from the east westward in
 it reaches its extreme limit moscow and then with remarkable
symmetry a countermovement occurs from east to west attracting to it
as the first movement had done the nations of middle europe the
counter movement reaches the starting point of the first movement in the
westparisand subsides

during that twentyyear period an immense number of fields were left
untilled houses were burned trade changed its direction millions of
men migrated were impoverished or were enriched and millions of
christian men professing the law of love of their fellows slew one
another

what does all this mean why did it happen what made those people burn
houses and slay their fellow men what were the causes of these events
what force made men act so these are the instinctive plain and most
legitimate questions humanity asks itself when it encounters the
monuments and tradition of that period

for a reply to these questions the common sense of mankind turns to the
science of history whose aim is to enable nations and humanity to know
themselves

if history had retained the conception of the ancients it would have
said that god to reward or punish his people gave napoleon power and
directed his will to the fulfillment of the divine ends and that reply
would have been clear and complete one might believe or disbelieve in
the divine significance of napoleon but for anyone believing in it
there would have been nothing unintelligible in the history of that
period nor would there have been any contradictions

but modern history cannot give that reply science does not admit the
conception of the ancients as to the direct participation of the deity
in human affairs and therefore history ought to give other answers

modern history replying to these questions says you want to know what
this movement means what caused it and what force produced these
events then listen

louis xiv was a very proud and selfconfident man he had such and such
mistresses and such and such ministers and he ruled france badly his
descendants were weak men and they too ruled france badly and they had
such and such favorites and such and such mistresses moreover certain
men wrote some books at that time at the end of the eighteenth century
there were a couple of dozen men in paris who began to talk about all
men being free and equal this caused people all over france to begin to
slash at and drown one another they killed the king and many other
people at that time there was in france a man of geniusnapoleon he
conquered everybody everywherethat is he killed many people because he
was a great genius and for some reason he went to kill africans and
killed them so well and was so cunning and wise that when he returned to
france he ordered everybody to obey him and they all obeyed him having
become an emperor he again went out to kill people in italy austria
and prussia and there too he killed a great many in russia there was
an emperor alexander who decided to restore order in europe and
therefore fought against napoleon in  he suddenly made friends with
him but in  they again quarreled and again began killing many
people napoleon led six hundred thousand men into russia and captured
moscow then he suddenly ran away from moscow and the emperor
alexander helped by the advice of stein and others united europe to
arm against the disturber of its peace all napoleons allies suddenly
became his enemies and their forces advanced against the fresh forces he
raised the allies defeated napoleon entered paris forced napoleon to
abdicate and sent him to the island of elba not depriving him of the
title of emperor and showing him every respect though five years before
and one year later they all regarded him as an outlaw and a brigand
then louis xviii who till then had been the laughingstock both of the
french and the allies began to reign and napoleon shedding tears
before his old guards renounced the throne and went into exile then
the skillful statesmen and diplomatists especially talleyrand who
managed to sit down in a particular chair before anyone else and thereby
extended the frontiers of france talked in vienna and by these
conversations made the nations happy or unhappy suddenly the
diplomatists and monarchs nearly quarreled and were on the point of
again ordering their armies to kill one another but just then napoleon
arrived in france with a battalion and the french who had been hating
him immediately all submitted to him but the allied monarchs were
angry at this and went to fight the french once more and they defeated
the genius napoleon and suddenly recognizing him as a brigand sent him
to the island of st helena and the exile separated from the beloved
france so dear to his heart died a lingering death on that rock and
bequeathed his great deeds to posterity but in europe a reaction
occurred and the sovereigns once again all began to oppress their
subjects

it would be a mistake to think that this is ironica caricature of the
historical accounts on the contrary it is a very mild expression of the
contradictory replies not meeting the questions which all the
historians give from the compilers of memoirs and the histories of
separate states to the writers of general histories and the new
histories of the culture of that period

the strangeness and absurdity of these replies arise from the fact that
modern history like a deaf man answers questions no one has asked

if the purpose of history be to give a description of the movement of
humanity and of the peoples the first questionin the absence of a
reply to which all the rest will be incomprehensibleis what is the
power that moves peoples to this modern history laboriously replies
either that napoleon was a great genius or that louis xiv was very
proud or that certain writers wrote certain books

all that may be so and mankind is ready to agree with it but it is not
what was asked all that would be interesting if we recognized a divine
power based on itself and always consistently directing its nations
through napoleons louises and writers but we do not acknowledge such
a power and therefore before speaking about napoleons louises and
authors we ought to be shown the connection existing between these men
and the movement of the nations

if instead of a divine power some other force has appeared it should be
explained in what this new force consists for the whole interest of
history lies precisely in that force

history seems to assume that this force is selfevident and known to
everyone but in spite of every desire to regard it as known anyone
reading many historical works cannot help doubting whether this new
force so variously understood by the historians themselves is really
quite well known to everybody





chapter ii

what force moves the nations

biographical historians and historians of separate nations understand
this force as a power inherent in heroes and rulers in their narration
events occur solely by the will of a napoleon and alexander or in
general of the persons they describe the answers given by this kind of
historian to the question of what force causes events to happen are
satisfactory only as long as there is but one historian to each event
as soon as historians of different nationalities and tendencies begin to
describe the same event the replies they give immediately lose all
meaning for this force is understood by them all not only differently
but often in quite contradictory ways one historian says that an event
was produced by napoleons power another that it was produced by
alexanders a third that it was due to the power of some other person
besides this historians of that kind contradict each other even in
their statement as to the force on which the authority of some
particular person was based thiers a bonapartist says that napoleons
power was based on his virtue and genius lanfrey a republican says it
was based on his trickery and deception of the people so the historians
of this class by mutually destroying one anothers positions destroy
the understanding of the force which produces events and furnish no
reply to historys essential question

writers of universal history who deal with all the nations seem to
recognize how erroneous is the specialist historians view of the force
which produces events they do not recognize it as a power inherent in
heroes and rulers but as the resultant of a multiplicity of variously
directed forces in describing a war or the subjugation of a people a
general historian looks for the cause of the event not in the power of
one man but in the interaction of many persons connected with the
event

according to this view the power of historical personages represented
as the product of many forces can no longer it would seem be regarded
as a force that itself produces events yet in most cases universal
historians still employ the conception of power as a force that itself
produces events and treat it as their cause in their exposition an
historic character is first the product of his time and his power only
the resultant of various forces and then his power is itself a force
producing events gervinus schlosser and others for instance at one
time prove napoleon to be a product of the revolution of the ideas of
 and so forth and at another plainly say that the campaign of
and other things they do not like were simply the product of napoleons
misdirected will and that the very ideas of  were arrested in their
development by napoleons caprice the ideas of the revolution and the
general temper of the age produced napoleons power but napoleons
power suppressed the ideas of the revolution and the general temper of
the age

this curious contradiction is not accidental not only does it occur at
every step but the universal historians accounts are all made up of a
chain of such contradictions this contradiction occurs because after
entering the field of analysis the universal historians stop halfway

to find component forces equal to the composite or resultant force the
sum of the components must equal the resultant this condition is never
observed by the universal historians and so to explain the resultant
forces they are obliged to admit in addition to the insufficient
components another unexplained force affecting the resultant action

specialist historians describing the campaign of  or the restoration
of the bourbons plainly assert that these events were produced by the
will of alexander but the universal historian gervinus refuting this
opinion of the specialist historian tries to prove that the campaign of
 and the restoration of the bourbons were due to other things beside
alexanders willsuch as the activity of stein metternich madame de
stael talleyrand fichte chateaubriand and others the historian
evidently decomposes alexanders power into the components talleyrand
chateaubriand and the restbut the sum of the components that is the
interactions of chateaubriand talleyrand madame de stael and the
others evidently does not equal the resultant namely the phenomenon of
millions of frenchmen submitting to the bourbons that chateaubriand
madame de stael and others spoke certain words to one another only
affected their mutual relations but does not account for the submission
of millions and therefore to explain how from these relations of theirs
the submission of millions of people resultedthat is how component
forces equal to one a gave a resultant equal to a thousand times athe
historian is again obliged to fall back on powerthe force he had
deniedand to recognize it as the resultant of the forces that is he
has to admit an unexplained force acting on the resultant and that is
just what the universal historians do and consequently they not only
contradict the specialist historians but contradict themselves

peasants having no clear idea of the cause of rain say according to
whether they want rain or fine weather the wind has blown the clouds
away or the wind has brought up the clouds and in the same way the
universal historians sometimes when it pleases them and fits in with
their theory say that power is the result of events and sometimes
when they want to prove something else say that power produces events

a third class of historiansthe socalled historians of
culturefollowing the path laid down by the universal historians who
sometimes accept writers and ladies as forces producing eventsagain
take that force to be something quite different they see it in what is
called culturein mental activity

the historians of culture are quite consistent in regard to their
progenitors the writers of universal histories for if historical
events may be explained by the fact that certain persons treated one
another in such and such ways why not explain them by the fact that
such and such people wrote such and such books of the immense number of
indications accompanying every vital phenomenon these historians select
the indication of intellectual activity and say that this indication is
the cause but despite their endeavors to prove that the cause of events
lies in intellectual activity only by a great stretch can one admit
that there is any connection between intellectual activity and the
movement of peoples and in no case can one admit that intellectual
activity controls peoples actions for that view is not confirmed by
such facts as the very cruel murders of the french revolution resulting
from the doctrine of the equality of man or the very cruel wars and
executions resulting from the preaching of love

but even admitting as correct all the cunningly devised arguments with
which these histories are filledadmitting that nations are governed by
some undefined force called an ideahistorys essential question still
remains unanswered and to the former power of monarchs and to the
influence of advisers and other people introduced by the universal
historians another newer forcethe ideais added the connection of
which with the masses needs explanation it is possible to understand
that napoleon had power and so events occurred with some effort one may
even conceive that napoleon together with other influences was the cause
of an event but how a book le contrat social had the effect of making
frenchmen begin to drown one another cannot be understood without an
explanation of the causal nexus of this new force with the event

undoubtedly some relation exists between all who live contemporaneously
and so it is possible to find some connection between the intellectual
activity of men and their historical movements just as such a
connection may be found between the movements of humanity and commerce
handicraft gardening or anything else you please but why intellectual
activity is considered by the historians of culture to be the cause or
expression of the whole historical movement is hard to understand only
the following considerations can have led the historians to such a
conclusion  that history is written by learned men and so it is
natural and agreeable for them to think that the activity of their class
supplies the basis of the movement of all humanity just as a similar
belief is natural and agreeable to traders agriculturists and soldiers
if they do not express it that is merely because traders and soldiers
do not write history and  that spiritual activity enlightenment
civilization culture ideas are all indistinct indefinite conceptions
under whose banner it is very easy to use words having a still less
definite meaning and which can therefore be readily introduced into any
theory

but not to speak of the intrinsic quality of histories of this kind
which may possibly even be of use to someone for something the
histories of culture to which all general histories tend more and more
to approximate are significant from the fact that after seriously and
minutely examining various religious philosophic and political
doctrines as causes of events as soon as they have to describe an
actual historic event such as the campaign of  for instance they
involuntarily describe it as resulting from an exercise of powerand say
plainly that that was the result of napoleons will speaking so the
historians of culture involuntarily contradict themselves and show that
the new force they have devised does not account for what happens in
history and that history can only be explained by introducing a power
which they apparently do not recognize





chapter iii

a locomotive is moving someone asks what moves it a peasant says
the devil moves it another man says the locomotive moves because its
wheels go round a third asserts that the cause of its movement lies in
the smoke which the wind carries away

the peasant is irrefutable he has devised a complete explanation to
refute him someone would have to prove to him that there is no devil or
another peasant would have to explain to him that it is not the devil
but a german who moves the locomotive only then as a result of the
contradiction will they see that they are both wrong but the man who
says that the movement of the wheels is the cause refutes himself for
having once begun to analyze he ought to go on and explain further why
the wheels go round and till he has reached the ultimate cause of the
movement of the locomotive in the pressure of steam in the boiler he
has no right to stop in his search for the cause the man who explains
the movement of the locomotive by the smoke that is carried back has
noticed that the wheels do not supply an explanation and has taken the
first sign that occurs to him and in his turn has offered that as an
explanation

the only conception that can explain the movement of the locomotive is
that of a force commensurate with the movement observed

the only conception that can explain the movement of the peoples is that
of some force commensurate with the whole movement of the peoples

yet to supply this conception various historians take forces of
different kinds all of which are incommensurate with the movement
observed some see it as a force directly inherent in heroes as the
peasant sees the devil in the locomotive others as a force resulting
from several other forces like the movement of the wheels others again
as an intellectual influence like the smoke that is blown away

so long as histories are written of separate individuals whether
caesars alexanders luthers or voltaires and not the histories of
all absolutely all those who take part in an event it is quite
impossible to describe the movement of humanity without the conception
of a force compelling men to direct their activity toward a certain end
and the only such conception known to historians is that of power

this conception is the one handle by means of which the material of
history as at present expounded can be dealt with and anyone who
breaks that handle off as buckle did without finding some other method
of treating historical material merely deprives himself of the one
possible way of dealing with it the necessity of the conception of
power as an explanation of historical events is best demonstrated by the
universal historians and historians of culture themselves for they
professedly reject that conception but inevitably have recourse to it at
every step

in dealing with humanitys inquiry the science of history up to now is
like money in circulationpaper money and coin the biographies and
special national histories are like paper money they can be used and
can circulate and fulfill their purpose without harm to anyone and even
advantageously as long as no one asks what is the security behind them
you need only forget to ask how the will of heroes produces events and
such histories as thiers will be interesting and instructive and may
perhaps even possess a tinge of poetry but just as doubts of the real
value of paper money arise either because being easy to make too much
of it gets made or because people try to exchange it for gold so also
doubts concerning the real value of such histories arise either because
too many of them are written or because in his simplicity of heart
someone inquires by what force did napoleon do thisthat is wants to
exchange the current paper money for the real gold of actual
comprehension

the writers of universal histories and of the history of culture are
like people who recognizing the defects of paper money decide to
substitute for it money made of metal that has not the specific gravity
of gold it may indeed make jingling coin but will do no more than
that paper money may deceive the ignorant but nobody is deceived by
tokens of base metal that have no value but merely jingle as gold is
gold only if it is serviceable not merely for exchange but also for use
so universal historians will be valuable only when they can reply to
historys essential question what is power the universal historians
give contradictory replies to that question while the historians of
culture evade it and answer something quite different and as counters
of imitation gold can be used only among a group of people who agree to
accept them as gold or among those who do not know the nature of gold
so universal historians and historians of culture not answering
humanitys essential question serve as currency for some purposes of
their own only in universities and among the mass of readers who have a
taste for what they call serious reading





chapter iv

having abandoned the conception of the ancients as to the divine
subjection of the will of a nation to some chosen man and the subjection
of that mans will to the deity history cannot without contradictions
take a single step till it has chosen one of two things either a return
to the former belief in the direct intervention of the deity in human
affairs or a definite explanation of the meaning of the force producing
historical events and termed power

a return to the first is impossible the belief has been destroyed and
so it is essential to explain what is meant by power

napoleon ordered an army to be raised and go to war we are so
accustomed to that idea and have become so used to it that the question
why did six hundred thousand men go to fight when napoleon uttered
certain words seems to us senseless he had the power and so what he
ordered was done

this reply is quite satisfactory if we believe that the power was given
him by god but as soon as we do not admit that it becomes essential to
determine what is this power of one man over others

it cannot be the direct physical power of a strong man over a weak onea
domination based on the application or threat of physical force like
the power of hercules nor can it be based on the effect of moral force
as in their simplicity some historians think who say that the leading
figures in history are heroes that is men gifted with a special
strength of soul and mind called genius this power cannot be based on
the predominance of moral strength for not to mention heroes such as
napoleon about whose moral qualities opinions differ widely history
shows us that neither a louis xi nor a metternich who ruled over
millions of people had any particular moral qualities but on the
contrary were generally morally weaker than any of the millions they
ruled over

if the source of power lies neither in the physical nor in the moral
qualities of him who possesses it it must evidently be looked for
elsewherein the relation to the people of the man who wields the power

and that is how power is understood by the science of jurisprudence
that exchange bank of history which offers to exchange historys
understanding of power for true gold

power is the collective will of the people transferred by expressed or
tacit consent to their chosen rulers

in the domain of jurisprudence which consists of discussions of how a
state and power might be arranged were it possible for all that to be
arranged it is all very clear but when applied to history that
definition of power needs explanation

the science of jurisprudence regards the state and power as the ancients
regarded firenamely as something existing absolutely but for history
the state and power are merely phenomena just as for modern physics
fire is not an element but a phenomenon

from this fundamental difference between the view held by history and
that held by jurisprudence it follows that jurisprudence can tell
minutely how in its opinion power should be constituted and what
powerexisting immutably outside timeis but to historys questions
about the meaning of the mutations of power in time it can answer
nothing

if power be the collective will of the people transferred to their
ruler was pugachev a representative of the will of the people if not
then why was napoleon i why was napoleon iii a criminal when he was
taken prisoner at boulogne and why later on were those criminals whom
he arrested

do palace revolutionsin which sometimes only two or three people take
parttransfer the will of the people to a new ruler in international
relations is the will of the people also transferred to their
conqueror was the will of the confederation of the rhine transferred to
napoleon in  was the will of the russian people transferred to
napoleon in  when our army in alliance with the french went to
fight the austrians

to these questions three answers are possible

either to assume  that the will of the people is always
unconditionally transferred to the ruler or rulers they have chosen and
that therefore every emergence of a new power every struggle against
the power once appointed should be absolutely regarded as an
infringement of the real power or  that the will of the people is
transferred to the rulers conditionally under definite and known
conditions and to show that all limitations conflicts and even
destructions of power result from a nonobservance by the rulers of the
conditions under which their power was entrusted to them or  that
the will of the people is delegated to the rulers conditionally but
that the conditions are unknown and indefinite and that the appearance
of several authorities their struggles and their falls result solely
from the greater or lesser fulfillment by the rulers of these unknown
conditions on which the will of the people is transferred from some
people to others

and these are the three ways in which the historians do explain the
relation of the people to their rulers

some historiansthose biographical and specialist historians already
referred toin their simplicity failing to understand the question of
the meaning of power seem to consider that the collective will of the
people is unconditionally transferred to historical persons and
therefore when describing some single state they assume that particular
power to be the one absolute and real power and that any other force
opposing this is not a power but a violation of powermere violence

their theory suitable for primitive and peaceful periods of history
has the inconveniencein application to complex and stormy periods in
the life of nations during which various powers arise simultaneously and
struggle with one anotherthat a legitimist historian will prove that
the national convention the directory and bonaparte were mere
infringers of the true power while a republican and a bonapartist will
prove the one that the convention and the other that the empire was the
real power and that all the others were violations of power evidently
the explanations furnished by these historians being mutually
contradictory can only satisfy young children

recognizing the falsity of this view of history another set of
historians say that power rests on a conditional delegation of the will
of the people to their rulers and that historical leaders have power
only conditionally on carrying out the program that the will of the
people has by tacit agreement prescribed to them but what this program
consists in these historians do not say or if they do they continually
contradict one another

each historian according to his view of what constitutes a nations
progress looks for these conditions in the greatness wealth freedom
or enlightenment of citizens of france or some other country but not to
mention the historians contradictions as to the nature of this
programor even admitting that some one general program of these
conditions existsthe facts of history almost always contradict that
theory if the conditions under which power is entrusted consist in the
wealth freedom and enlightenment of the people how is it that louis
xiv and ivan the terrible end their reigns tranquilly while louis xvi
and charles i are executed by their people to this question historians
reply that louis xivs activity contrary to the program reacted on
louis xvi but why did it not react on louis xiv or on louis xvwhy
should it react just on louis xvi and what is the time limit for such
reactions to these questions there are and can be no answers equally
little does this view explain why for several centuries the collective
will is not withdrawn from certain rulers and their heirs and then
suddenly during a period of fifty years is transferred to the
convention to the directory to napoleon to alexander to louis xviii
to napoleon again to charles x to louis philippe to a republican
government and to napoleon iii when explaining these rapid transfers
of the peoples will from one individual to another especially in view
of international relations conquests and alliances the historians are
obliged to admit that some of these transfers are not normal delegations
of the peoples will but are accidents dependent on cunning on
mistakes on craft or on the weakness of a diplomatist a ruler or a
party leader so that the greater part of the events of historycivil
wars revolutions and conquestsare presented by these historians not
as the results of free transferences of the peoples will but as
results of the illdirected will of one or more individuals that is
once again as usurpations of power and so these historians also see
and admit historical events which are exceptions to the theory

these historians resemble a botanist who having noticed that some
plants grow from seeds producing two cotyledons should insist that all
that grows does so by sprouting into two leaves and that the palm the
mushroom and even the oak which blossom into full growth and no longer
resemble two leaves are deviations from the theory

historians of the third class assume that the will of the people is
transferred to historic personages conditionally but that the
conditions are unknown to us they say that historical personages have
power only because they fulfill the will of the people which has been
delegated to them

but in that case if the force that moves nations lies not in the
historic leaders but in the nations themselves what significance have
those leaders

the leaders these historians tell us express the will of the people
the activity of the leaders represents the activity of the people

but in that case the question arises whether all the activity of the
leaders serves as an expression of the peoples will or only some part
of it if the whole activity of the leaders serves as the expression of
the peoples will as some historians suppose then all the details of
the court scandals contained in the biographies of a napoleon or a
catherine serve to express the life of the nation which is evident
nonsense but if it is only some particular side of the activity of an
historical leader which serves to express the peoples life as other
socalled philosophical historians believe then to determine which
side of the activity of a leader expresses the nations life we have
first of all to know in what the nations life consists

met by this difficulty historians of that class devise some most
obscure impalpable and general abstraction which can cover all
conceivable occurrences and declare this abstraction to be the aim of
humanitys movement the most usual generalizations adopted by almost
all the historians are freedom equality enlightenment progress
civilization and culture postulating some generalization as the goal
of the movement of humanity the historians study the men of whom the
greatest number of monuments have remained kings ministers generals
authors reformers popes and journalists to the extent to which in
their opinion these persons have promoted or hindered that abstraction
but as it is in no way proved that the aim of humanity does consist in
freedom equality enlightenment or civilization and as the connection
of the people with the rulers and enlighteners of humanity is only based
on the arbitrary assumption that the collective will of the people is
always transferred to the men whom we have noticed it happens that the
activity of the millions who migrate burn houses abandon agriculture
and destroy one another never is expressed in the account of the
activity of some dozen people who did not burn houses practice
agriculture or slay their fellow creatures

history proves this at every turn is the ferment of the peoples of the
west at the end of the eighteenth century and their drive eastward
explained by the activity of louis xiv xv and xvi their mistresses
and ministers and by the lives of napoleon rousseau diderot
beaumarchais and others

is the movement of the russian people eastward to kazan and siberia
expressed by details of the morbid character of ivan the terrible and by
his correspondence with kurbski

is the movement of the peoples at the time of the crusades explained by
the life and activity of the godfreys and the louises and their ladies
for us that movement of the peoples from west to east without leaders
with a crowd of vagrants and with peter the hermit remains
incomprehensible and yet more incomprehensible is the cessation of that
movement when a rational and sacred aim for the crusadethe deliverance
of jerusalemhad been clearly defined by historic leaders popes kings
and knights incited the peoples to free the holy land but the people
did not go for the unknown cause which had previously impelled them to
go no longer existed the history of the godfreys and the minnesingers
can evidently not cover the life of the peoples and the history of the
godfreys and the minnesingers has remained the history of godfreys and
minnesingers but the history of the life of the peoples and their
impulses has remained unknown

still less does the history of authors and reformers explain to us the
life of the peoples

the history of culture explains to us the impulses and conditions of
life and thought of a writer or a reformer we learn that luther had a
hot temper and said such and such things we learn that rousseau was
suspicious and wrote such and such books but we do not learn why after
the reformation the peoples massacred one another nor why during the
french revolution they guillotined one another

if we unite both these kinds of history as is done by the newest
historians we shall have the history of monarchs and writers but not
the history of the life of the peoples





chapter v

the life of the nations is not contained in the lives of a few men for
the connection between those men and the nations has not been found the
theory that this connection is based on the transference of the
collective will of a people to certain historical personages is an
hypothesis unconfirmed by the experience of history

the theory of the transference of the collective will of the people to
historic persons may perhaps explain much in the domain of jurisprudence
and be essential for its purposes but in its application to history as
soon as revolutions conquests or civil wars occurthat is as soon as
history beginsthat theory explains nothing

the theory seems irrefutable just because the act of transference of the
peoples will cannot be verified for it never occurred

whatever happens and whoever may stand at the head of affairs the
theory can always say that such and such a person took the lead because
the collective will was transferred to him

the replies this theory gives to historical questions are like the
replies of a man who watching the movements of a herd of cattle and
paying no attention to the varying quality of the pasturage in different
parts of the field or to the driving of the herdsman should attribute
the direction the herd takes to what animal happens to be at its head

the herd goes in that direction because the animal in front leads it
and the collective will of all the other animals is vested in that
leader this is what historians of the first class saythose who assume
the unconditional transference of the peoples will

if the animals leading the herd change this happens because the
collective will of all the animals is transferred from one leader to
another according to whether the animal is or is not leading them in
the direction selected by the whole herd such is the reply historians
who assume that the collective will of the people is delegated to rulers
under conditions which they regard as known with this method of
observation it often happens that the observer influenced by the
direction he himself prefers regards those as leaders who owing to the
peoples change of direction are no longer in front but on one side
or even in the rear

if the animals in front are continually changing and the direction of
the whole herd is constantly altered this is because in order to follow
a given direction the animals transfer their will to the animals that
have attracted our attention and to study the movements of the herd we
must watch the movements of all the prominent animals moving on all
sides of the herd so say the third class of historians who regard all
historical persons from monarchs to journalists as the expression of
their age

the theory of the transference of the will of the people to historic
persons is merely a paraphrasea restatement of the question in other
words

what causes historical events power what is power power is the
collective will of the people transferred to one person under what
condition is the will of the people delegated to one person on
condition that that person expresses the will of the whole people that
is power is power in other words power is a word the meaning of which
we do not understand

if the realm of human knowledge were confined to abstract reasoning
then having subjected to criticism the explanation of power that
juridical science gives us humanity would conclude that power is merely
a word and has no real existence but to understand phenomena man has
besides abstract reasoning experience by which he verifies his
reflections and experience tells us that power is not merely a word but
an actually existing phenomenon

not to speak of the fact that no description of the collective activity
of men can do without the conception of power the existence of power is
proved both by history and by observing contemporary events

whenever an event occurs a man appears or men appear by whose will the
event seems to have taken place napoleon iii issues a decree and the
french go to mexico the king of prussia and bismarck issue decrees and
an army enters bohemia napoleon i issues a decree and an army enters
russia alexander i gives a command and the french submit to the
bourbons experience shows us that whatever event occurs it is always
related to the will of one or of several men who have decreed it

the historians in accord with the old habit of acknowledging divine
intervention in human affairs want to see the cause of events in the
expression of the will of someone endowed with power but that
supposition is not confirmed either by reason or by experience

on the one side reflection shows that the expression of a mans willhis
wordsare only part of the general activity expressed in an event as
for instance in a war or a revolution and so without assuming an
incomprehensible supernatural forcea miracleone cannot admit that
words can be the immediate cause of the movements of millions of men on
the other hand even if we admitted that words could be the cause of
events history shows that the expression of the will of historical
personages does not in most cases produce any effect that is to say
their commands are often not executed and sometimes the very opposite
of what they order occurs

without admitting divine intervention in the affairs of humanity we
cannot regard power as the cause of events

power from the standpoint of experience is merely the relation that
exists between the expression of someones will and the execution of
that will by others

to explain the conditions of that relationship we must first establish a
conception of the expression of will referring it to man and not to the
deity

if the deity issues a command expresses his will as ancient history
tells us the expression of that will is independent of time and is not
caused by anything for the divinity is not controlled by an event but
speaking of commands that are the expression of the will of men acting
in time and in relation to one another to explain the connection of
commands with events we must restore  the condition of all that
takes place the continuity of movement in time both of the events and
of the person who commands and  the inevitability of the connection
between the person commanding and those who execute his command





chapter vi

only the expression of the will of the deity not dependent on time can
relate to a whole series of events occurring over a period of years or
centuries and only the deity independent of everything can by his
sole will determine the direction of humanitys movement but man acts
in time and himself takes part in what occurs

reinstating the first condition omitted that of time we see that no
command can be executed without some preceding order having been given
rendering the execution of the last command possible

no command ever appears spontaneously or itself covers a whole series
of occurrences but each command follows from another and never refers
to a whole series of events but always to one moment only of an event

when for instance we say that napoleon ordered armies to go to war we
combine in one simultaneous expression a whole series of consecutive
commands dependent one on another napoleon could not have commanded an
invasion of russia and never did so today he ordered such and such
papers to be written to vienna to berlin and to petersburg tomorrow
such and such decrees and orders to the army the fleet the
commissariat and so on and so onmillions of commands which formed a
whole series corresponding to a series of events which brought the
french armies into russia

if throughout his reign napoleon gave commands concerning an invasion of
england and expended on no other undertaking so much time and effort
and yet during his whole reign never once attempted to execute that
design but undertook an expedition into russia with which country he
considered it desirable to be in alliance a conviction he repeatedly
expressedthis came about because his commands did not correspond to
the course of events in the first case but did so correspond in the
latter

for an order to be certainly executed it is necessary that a man should
order what can be executed but to know what can and what cannot be
executed is impossible not only in the case of napoleons invasion of
russia in which millions participated but even in the simplest event
for in either case millions of obstacles may arise to prevent its
execution every order executed is always one of an immense number
unexecuted all the impossible orders inconsistent with the course of
events remain unexecuted only the possible ones get linked up with a
consecutive series of commands corresponding to a series of events and
are executed

our false conception that an event is caused by a command which precedes
it is due to the fact that when the event has taken place and out of
thousands of others those few commands which were consistent with that
event have been executed we forget about the others that were not
executed because they could not be apart from that the chief source of
our error in this matter is due to the fact that in the historical
accounts a whole series of innumerable diverse and petty events such
for instance as all those which led the french armies to russia is
generalized into one event in accord with the result produced by that
series of events and corresponding with this generalization the whole
series of commands is also generalized into a single expression of will

we say that napoleon wished to invade russia and invaded it in reality
in all napoleons activity we never find anything resembling an
expression of that wish but find a series of orders or expressions of
his will very variously and indefinitely directed amid a long series
of unexecuted orders of napoleons one series for the campaign of
was carried outnot because those orders differed in any way from the
other unexecuted orders but because they coincided with the course of
events that led the french army into russia just as in stencil work
this or that figure comes out not because the color was laid on from
this side or in that way but because it was laid on from all sides over
the figure cut in the stencil

so that examining the relation in time of the commands to the events we
find that a command can never be the cause of the event but that a
certain definite dependence exists between the two

to understand in what this dependence consists it is necessary to
reinstate another omitted condition of every command proceeding not from
the deity but from a man which is that the man who gives the command
himself takes part in the event

this relation of the commander to those he commands is just what is
called power this relation consists in the following

for common action people always unite in certain combinations in which
regardless of the difference of the aims set for the common action the
relation between those taking part in it is always the same

men uniting in these combinations always assume such relations toward
one another that the larger number take a more direct share and the
smaller number a less direct share in the collective action for which
they have combined

of all the combinations in which men unite for collective action one of
the most striking and definite examples is an army

every army is composed of lower grades of the servicethe rank and
fileof whom there are always the greatest number of the next higher
military rankcorporals and noncommissioned officers of whom there are
fewer and of stillhigher officers of whom there are still fewer and
so on to the highest military command which is concentrated in one
person

a military organization may be quite correctly compared to a cone of
which the base with the largest diameter consists of the rank and file
the next higher and smaller section of the cone consists of the next
higher grades of the army and so on to the apex the point of which
will represent the commanderinchief

the soldiers of whom there are the most form the lower section of the
cone and its base the soldier himself does the stabbing hacking
burning and pillaging and always receives orders for these actions
from men above him he himself never gives an order the noncommissioned
officers of whom there are fewer perform the action itself less
frequently than the soldiers but they already give commands an officer
still less often acts directly himself but commands still more
frequently a general does nothing but command the troops indicates the
objective and hardly ever uses a weapon himself the commanderinchief
never takes direct part in the action itself but only gives general
orders concerning the movement of the mass of the troops a similar
relation of people to one another is seen in every combination of men
for common activityin agriculture trade and every administration

and so without particularly analyzing all the contiguous sections of a
cone and of the ranks of an army or the ranks and positions in any
administrative or public business whatever from the lowest to the
highest we see a law by which men to take associated action combine
in such relations that the more directly they participate in performing
the action the less they can command and the more numerous they are
while the less their direct participation in the action itself the more
they command and the fewer of them there are rising in this way from
the lowest ranks to the man at the top who takes the least direct share
in the action and directs his activity chiefly to commanding

this relation of the men who command to those they command is what
constitutes the essence of the conception called power

having restored the condition of time under which all events occur we
find that a command is executed only when it is related to a
corresponding series of events restoring the essential condition of
relation between those who command and those who execute we find that
by the very nature of the case those who command take the smallest part
in the action itself and that their activity is exclusively directed to
commanding





chapter vii

when an event is taking place people express their opinions and wishes
about it and as the event results from the collective activity of many
people some one of the opinions or wishes expressed is sure to be
fulfilled if but approximately when one of the opinions expressed is
fulfilled that opinion gets connected with the event as a command
preceding it

men are hauling a log each of them expresses his opinion as to how and
where to haul it they haul the log away and it happens that this is
done as one of them said he ordered it there we have command and power
in their primary form the man who worked most with his hands could not
think so much about what he was doing or reflect on or command what
would result from the common activity while the man who commanded more
would evidently work less with his hands on account of his greater
verbal activity

when some larger concourse of men direct their activity to a common aim
there is a yet sharper division of those who because their activity is
given to directing and commanding take less part in the direct work

when a man works alone he always has a certain set of reflections which
as it seems to him directed his past activity justify his present
activity and guide him in planning his future actions just the same is
done by a concourse of people allowing those who do not take a direct
part in the activity to devise considerations justifications and
surmises concerning their collective activity

for reasons known or unknown to us the french began to drown and kill
one another and corresponding to the event its justification appears in
peoples belief that this was necessary for the welfare of france for
liberty and for equality people ceased to kill one another and this
event was accompanied by its justification in the necessity for a
centralization of power resistance to europe and so on men went from
the west to the east killing their fellow men and the event was
accompanied by phrases about the glory of france the baseness of
england and so on history shows us that these justifications of the
events have no common sense and are all contradictory as in the case of
killing a man as the result of recognizing his rights and the killing
of millions in russia for the humiliation of england but these
justifications have a very necessary significance in their own day

these justifications release those who produce the events from moral
responsibility these temporary aims are like the broom fixed in front
of a locomotive to clear the snow from the rails in front they clear
mens moral responsibilities from their path

without such justification there would be no reply to the simplest
question that presents itself when examining each historical event how
is it that millions of men commit collective crimesmake war commit
murder and so on

with the present complex forms of political and social life in europe
can any event that is not prescribed decreed or ordered by monarchs
ministers parliaments or newspapers be imagined is there any
collective action which cannot find its justification in political
unity in patriotism in the balance of power or in civilization so
that every event that occurs inevitably coincides with some expressed
wish and receiving a justification presents itself as the result of
the will of one man or of several men

in whatever direction a ship moves the flow of the waves it cuts will
always be noticeable ahead of it to those on board the ship the
movement of those waves will be the only perceptible motion

only by watching closely moment by moment the movement of that flow and
comparing it with the movement of the ship do we convince ourselves that
every bit of it is occasioned by the forward movement of the ship and
that we were led into error by the fact that we ourselves were
imperceptibly moving

we see the same if we watch moment by moment the movement of historical
characters that is reestablish the inevitable condition of all that
occursthe continuity of movement in time and do not lose sight of the
essential connection of historical persons with the masses

when the ship moves in one direction there is one and the same wave
ahead of it when it turns frequently the wave ahead of it also turns
frequently but wherever it may turn there always will be the wave
anticipating its movement

whatever happens it always appears that just that event was foreseen and
decreed wherever the ship may go the rush of water which neither
directs nor increases its movement foams ahead of it and at a distance
seems to us not merely to move of itself but to govern the ships
movement also

examining only those expressions of the will of historical persons
which as commands were related to events historians have assumed that
the events depended on those commands but examining the events
themselves and the connection in which the historical persons stood to
the people we have found that they and their orders were dependent on
events the incontestable proof of this deduction is that however many
commands were issued the event does not take place unless there are
other causes for it but as soon as an event occursbe it what it
maythen out of all the continually expressed wishes of different people
some will always be found which by their meaning and their time of
utterance are related as commands to the events

arriving at this conclusion we can reply directly and positively to
these two essential questions of history

 what is power

 what force produces the movement of the nations

 power is the relation of a given person to other individuals in
which the more this person expresses opinions predictions and
justifications of the collective action that is performed the less is
his participation in that action

 the movement of nations is caused not by power nor by intellectual
activity nor even by a combination of the two as historians have
supposed but by the activity of all the people who participate in the
events and who always combine in such a way that those taking the
largest direct share in the event take on themselves the least
responsibility and vice versa

morally the wielder of power appears to cause the event physically it
is those who submit to the power but as the moral activity is
inconceivable without the physical the cause of the event is neither in
the one nor in the other but in the union of the two

or in other words the conception of a cause is inapplicable to the
phenomena we are examining

in the last analysis we reach the circle of infinitythat final limit to
which in every domain of thought mans reason arrives if it is not
playing with the subject electricity produces heat heat produces
electricity atoms attract each other and atoms repel one another

speaking of the interaction of heat and electricity and of atoms we
cannot say why this occurs and we say that it is so because it is
inconceivable otherwise because it must be so and that it is a law the
same applies to historical events why war and revolution occur we do
not know we only know that to produce the one or the other action
people combine in a certain formation in which they all take part and
we say that this is so because it is unthinkable otherwise or in other
words that it is a law





chapter viii

if history dealt only with external phenomena the establishment of this
simple and obvious law would suffice and we should have finished our
argument but the law of history relates to man a particle of matter
cannot tell us that it does not feel the law of attraction or repulsion
and that that law is untrue but man who is the subject of history
says plainly i am free and am therefore not subject to the law

the presence of the problem of mans free will though unexpressed is
felt at every step of history

all seriously thinking historians have involuntarily encountered this
question all the contradictions and obscurities of history and the
false path historical science has followed are due solely to the lack of
a solution of that question

if the will of every man were free that is if each man could act as he
pleased all history would be a series of disconnected incidents

if in a thousand years even one man in a million could act freely that
is as he chose it is evident that one single free act of that mans in
violation of the laws governing human action would destroy the
possibility of the existence of any laws for the whole of humanity

if there be a single law governing the actions of men free will cannot
exist for then mans will is subject to that law

in this contradiction lies the problem of free will which from most
ancient times has occupied the best human minds and from most ancient
times has been presented in its whole tremendous significance

the problem is that regarding man as a subject of observation from
whatever point of viewtheological historical ethical or
philosophicwe find a general law of necessity to which he like all
that exists is subject but regarding him from within ourselves as what
we are conscious of we feel ourselves to be free

this consciousness is a source of selfcognition quite apart from and
independent of reason through his reason man observes himself but only
through consciousness does he know himself

apart from consciousness of self no observation or application of reason
is conceivable

to understand observe and draw conclusions man must first of all be
conscious of himself as living a man is only conscious of himself as a
living being by the fact that he wills that is is conscious of his
volition but his willwhich forms the essence of his lifeman
recognizes and can but recognize as free

if observing himself man sees that his will is always directed by one
and the same law whether he observes the necessity of taking food
using his brain or anything else he cannot recognize this never
varying direction of his will otherwise than as a limitation of it were
it not free it could not be limited a mans will seems to him to be
limited just because he is not conscious of it except as free

you say i am not free but i have lifted my hand and let it fall
everyone understands that this illogical reply is an irrefutable
demonstration of freedom

that reply is the expression of a consciousness that is not subject to
reason

if the consciousness of freedom were not a separate and independent
source of selfconsciousness it would be subject to reasoning and to
experience but in fact such subjection does not exist and is
inconceivable

a series of experiments and arguments proves to every man that he as an
object of observation is subject to certain laws and man submits to
them and never resists the laws of gravity or impermeability once he has
become acquainted with them but the same series of experiments and
arguments proves to him that the complete freedom of which he is
conscious in himself is impossible and that his every action depends on
his organization his character and the motives acting upon him yet
man never submits to the deductions of these experiments and arguments
having learned from experiment and argument that a stone falls
downwards a man indubitably believes this and always expects the law
that he has learned to be fulfilled

but learning just as certainly that his will is subject to laws he does
not and cannot believe this

however often experiment and reasoning may show a man that under the
same conditions and with the same character he will do the same thing as
before yet when under the same conditions and with the same character
he approaches for the thousandth time the action that always ends in the
same way he feels as certainly convinced as before the experiment that
he can act as he pleases every man savage or sage however
incontestably reason and experiment may prove to him that it is
impossible to imagine two different courses of action in precisely the
same conditions feels that without this irrational conception which
constitutes the essence of freedom he cannot imagine life he feels
that however impossible it may be it is so for without this conception
of freedom not only would he be unable to understand life but he would
be unable to live for a single moment

he could not live because all mans efforts all his impulses to life
are only efforts to increase freedom wealth and poverty fame and
obscurity power and subordination strength and weakness health and
disease culture and ignorance work and leisure repletion and hunger
virtue and vice are only greater or lesser degrees of freedom

a man having no freedom cannot be conceived of except as deprived of
life

if the conception of freedom appears to reason to be a senseless
contradiction like the possibility of performing two actions at one and
the same instant of time or of an effect without a cause that only
proves that consciousness is not subject to reason

this unshakable irrefutable consciousness of freedom uncontrolled by
experiment or argument recognized by all thinkers and felt by everyone
without exception this consciousness without which no conception of man
is possible constitutes the other side of the question

man is the creation of an allpowerful allgood and allseeing god
what is sin the conception of which arises from the consciousness of
mans freedom that is a question for theology

the actions of men are subject to general immutable laws expressed in
statistics what is mans responsibility to society the conception of
which results from the conception of freedom that is a question for
jurisprudence

mans actions proceed from his innate character and the motives acting
upon him what is conscience and the perception of right and wrong in
actions that follows from the consciousness of freedom that is a
question for ethics

man in connection with the general life of humanity appears subject to
laws which determine that life but the same man apart from that
connection appears to be free how should the past life of nations and
of humanity be regardedas the result of the free or as the result of
the constrained activity of man that is a question for history

only in our selfconfident day of the popularization of knowledgethanks
to that most powerful engine of ignorance the diffusion of printed
matterhas the question of the freedom of will been put on a level on
which the question itself cannot exist in our time the majority of so
called advanced peoplethat is the crowd of ignoramuseshave taken the
work of the naturalists who deal with one side of the question for a
solution of the whole problem

they say and write and print that the soul and freedom do not exist for
the life of man is expressed by muscular movements and muscular
movements are conditioned by the activity of the nerves the soul and
free will do not exist because at an unknown period of time we sprang
from the apes they say this not at all suspecting that thousands of
years ago that same law of necessity which with such ardor they are now
trying to prove by physiology and comparative zoology was not merely
acknowledged by all the religions and all the thinkers but has never
been denied they do not see that the role of the natural sciences in
this matter is merely to serve as an instrument for the illumination of
one side of it for the fact that from the point of view of
observation reason and the will are merely secretions of the brain and
that man following the general law may have developed from lower animals
at some unknown period of time only explains from a fresh side the
truth admitted thousands of years ago by all the religious and
philosophic theoriesthat from the point of view of reason man is
subject to the law of necessity but it does not advance by a hairs
breadth the solution of the question which has another opposite side
based on the consciousness of freedom

if men descended from the apes at an unknown period of time that is as
comprehensible as that they were made from a handful of earth at a
certain period of time in the first case the unknown quantity is the
time in the second case it is the origin and the question of how
mans consciousness of freedom is to be reconciled with the law of
necessity to which he is subject cannot be solved by comparative
physiology and zoology for in a frog a rabbit or an ape we can
observe only the muscular nervous activity but in man we observe
consciousness as well as the muscular and nervous activity

the naturalists and their followers thinking they can solve this
question are like plasterers set to plaster one side of the walls of a
church who availing themselves of the absence of the chief
superintendent of the work should in an access of zeal plaster over the
windows icons woodwork and still unbuttressed walls and should be
delighted that from their point of view as plasterers everything is now
so smooth and regular





chapter ix

for the solution of the question of free will or inevitability history
has this advantage over other branches of knowledge in which the
question is dealt with that for history this question does not refer to
the essence of mans free will but its manifestation in the past and
under certain conditions

in regard to this question history stands to the other sciences as
experimental science stands to abstract science

the subject for history is not mans will itself but our presentation of
it

and so for history the insoluble mystery presented by the
incompatibility of free will and inevitability does not exist as it does
for theology ethics and philosophy history surveys a presentation of
mans life in which the union of these two contradictions has already
taken place

in actual life each historic event each human action is very clearly
and definitely understood without any sense of contradiction although
each event presents itself as partly free and partly compulsory

to solve the question of how freedom and necessity are combined and what
constitutes the essence of these two conceptions the philosophy of
history can and should follow a path contrary to that taken by other
sciences instead of first defining the conceptions of freedom and
inevitability in themselves and then ranging the phenomena of life
under those definitions history should deduce a definition of the
conception of freedom and inevitability themselves from the immense
quantity of phenomena of which it is cognizant and that always appear
dependent on these two elements

whatever presentation of the activity of many men or of an individual we
may consider we always regard it as the result partly of mans free
will and partly of the law of inevitability

whether we speak of the migration of the peoples and the incursions of
the barbarians or of the decrees of napoleon iii or of someones
action an hour ago in choosing one direction out of several for his
walk we are unconscious of any contradiction the degree of freedom and
inevitability governing the actions of these people is clearly defined
for us

our conception of the degree of freedom often varies according to
differences in the point of view from which we regard the event but
every human action appears to us as a certain combination of freedom and
inevitability in every action we examine we see a certain measure of
freedom and a certain measure of inevitability and always the more
freedom we see in any action the less inevitability do we perceive and
the more inevitability the less freedom

the proportion of freedom to inevitability decreases and increases
according to the point of view from which the action is regarded but
their relation is always one of inverse proportion

a sinking man who clutches at another and drowns him or a hungry mother
exhausted by feeding her baby who steals some food or a man trained to
discipline who on duty at the word of command kills a defenseless
manseem less guilty that is less free and more subject to the law of
necessity to one who knows the circumstances in which these people were
placed and more free to one who does not know that the man was himself
drowning that the mother was hungry that the soldier was in the ranks
and so on similarly a man who committed a murder twenty years ago and
has since lived peaceably and harmlessly in society seems less guilty
and his action more due to the law of inevitability to someone who
considers his action after twenty years have elapsed than to one who
examined it the day after it was committed and in the same way every
action of an insane intoxicated or highly excited man appears less
free and more inevitable to one who knows the mental condition of him
who committed the action and seems more free and less inevitable to one
who does not know it in all these cases the conception of freedom is
increased or diminished and the conception of compulsion is
correspondingly decreased or increased according to the point of view
from which the action is regarded so that the greater the conception of
necessity the smaller the conception of freedom and vice versa

religion the common sense of mankind the science of jurisprudence and
history itself understand alike this relation between necessity and
freedom

all cases without exception in which our conception of freedom and
necessity is increased and diminished depend on three considerations

 the relation to the external world of the man who commits the deeds

 his relation to time

 his relation to the causes leading to the action

the first consideration is the clearness of our perception of the mans
relation to the external world and the greater or lesser clearness of
our understanding of the definite position occupied by the man in
relation to everything coexisting with him this is what makes it
evident that a drowning man is less free and more subject to necessity
than one standing on dry ground and that makes the actions of a man
closely connected with others in a thickly populated district or of one
bound by family official or business duties seem certainly less free
and more subject to necessity than those of a man living in solitude and
seclusion

if we consider a man alone apart from his relation to everything around
him each action of his seems to us free but if we see his relation to
anything around him if we see his connection with anything
whateverwith a man who speaks to him a book he reads the work on
which he is engaged even with the air he breathes or the light that
falls on the things about himwe see that each of these circumstances
has an influence on him and controls at least some side of his activity
and the more we perceive of these influences the more our conception of
his freedom diminishes and the more our conception of the necessity that
weighs on him increases

the second consideration is the more or less evident time relation of
the man to the world and the clearness of our perception of the place
the mans action occupies in time that is the ground which makes the
fall of the first man resulting in the production of the human race
appear evidently less free than a mans entry into marriage today it is
the reason why the life and activity of people who lived centuries ago
and are connected with me in time cannot seem to me as free as the life
of a contemporary the consequences of which are still unknown to me

the degree of our conception of freedom or inevitability depends in this
respect on the greater or lesser lapse of time between the performance
of the action and our judgment of it

if i examine an act i performed a moment ago in approximately the same
circumstances as those i am in now my action appears to me undoubtedly
free but if i examine an act performed a month ago then being in
different circumstances i cannot help recognizing that if that act had
not been committed much that resulted from itgood agreeable and even
essentialwould not have taken place if i reflect on an action still
more remote ten years ago or more then the consequences of my action
are still plainer to me and i find it hard to imagine what would have
happened had that action not been performed the farther i go back in
memory or what is the same thing the farther i go forward in my
judgment the more doubtful becomes my belief in the freedom of my
action

in history we find a very similar progress of conviction concerning the
part played by free will in the general affairs of humanity a
contemporary event seems to us to be indubitably the doing of all the
known participants but with a more remote event we already see its
inevitable results which prevent our considering anything else possible
and the farther we go back in examining events the less arbitrary do
they appear

the austroprussian war appears to us undoubtedly the result of the
crafty conduct of bismarck and so on the napoleonic wars still seem to
us though already questionably to be the outcome of their heroes
will but in the crusades we already see an event occupying its definite
place in history and without which we cannot imagine the modern history
of europe though to the chroniclers of the crusades that event appeared
as merely due to the will of certain people in regard to the migration
of the peoples it does not enter anyones head today to suppose that the
renovation of the european world depended on attilas caprice the
farther back in history the object of our observation lies the more
doubtful does the free will of those concerned in the event become and
the more manifest the law of inevitability

the third consideration is the degree to which we apprehend that endless
chain of causation inevitably demanded by reason in which each
phenomenon comprehended and therefore mans every action must have its
definite place as a result of what has gone before and as a cause of
what will follow

the better we are acquainted with the physiological psychological and
historical laws deduced by observation and by which man is controlled
and the more correctly we perceive the physiological psychological and
historical causes of the action and the simpler the action we are
observing and the less complex the character and mind of the man in
question the more subject to inevitability and the less free do our
actions and those of others appear

when we do not at all understand the cause of an action whether a
crime a good action or even one that is simply nonmoral we ascribe a
greater amount of freedom to it in the case of a crime we most urgently
demand the punishment for such an act in the case of a virtuous act we
rate its merit most highly in an indifferent case we recognize in it
more individuality originality and independence but if even one of
the innumerable causes of the act is known to us we recognize a certain
element of necessity and are less insistent on punishment for the crime
or the acknowledgment of the merit of the virtuous act or the freedom
of the apparently original action that a criminal was reared among male
factors mitigates his fault in our eyes the selfsacrifice of a father
or mother or selfsacrifice with the possibility of a reward is more
comprehensible than gratuitous selfsacrifice and therefore seems less
deserving of sympathy and less the result of free will the founder of a
sect or party or an inventor impresses us less when we know how or by
what the way was prepared for his activity if we have a large range of
examples if our observation is constantly directed to seeking the
correlation of cause and effect in peoples actions their actions
appear to us more under compulsion and less free the more correctly we
connect the effects with the causes if we examined simple actions and
had a vast number of such actions under observation our conception of
their inevitability would be still greater the dishonest conduct of the
son of a dishonest father the misconduct of a woman who had fallen into
bad company a drunkards relapse into drunkenness and so on are
actions that seem to us less free the better we understand their cause
if the man whose actions we are considering is on a very low stage of
mental development like a child a madman or a simpletonthen knowing
the causes of the act and the simplicity of the character and
intelligence in question we see so large an element of necessity and so
little free will that as soon as we know the cause prompting the action
we can foretell the result

on these three considerations alone is based the conception of
irresponsibility for crimes and the extenuating circumstances admitted
by all legislative codes the responsibility appears greater or less
according to our greater or lesser knowledge of the circumstances in
which the man was placed whose action is being judged and according to
the greater or lesser interval of time between the commission of the
action and its investigation and according to the greater or lesser
understanding of the causes that led to the action





chapter x

thus our conception of free will and inevitability gradually diminishes
or increases according to the greater or lesser connection with the
external world the greater or lesser remoteness of time and the
greater or lesser dependence on the causes in relation to which we
contemplate a mans life

so that if we examine the case of a man whose connection with the
external world is well known where the time between the action and its
examination is great and where the causes of the action are most
accessible we get the conception of a maximum of inevitability and a
minimum of free will if we examine a man little dependent on external
conditions whose action was performed very recently and the causes of
whose action are beyond our ken we get the conception of a minimum of
inevitability and a maximum of freedom

in neither casehowever we may change our point of view however plain
we may make to ourselves the connection between the man and the external
world however inaccessible it may be to us however long or short the
period of time however intelligible or incomprehensible the causes of
the action may becan we ever conceive either complete freedom or
complete necessity

 to whatever degree we may imagine a man to be exempt from the
influence of the external world we never get a conception of freedom in
space every human action is inevitably conditioned by what surrounds
him and by his own body i lift my arm and let it fall my action seems
to me free but asking myself whether i could raise my arm in every
direction i see that i raised it in the direction in which there was
least obstruction to that action either from things around me or from
the construction of my own body i chose one out of all the possible
directions because in it there were fewest obstacles for my action to
be free it was necessary that it should encounter no obstacles to
conceive of a man being free we must imagine him outside space which is
evidently impossible

 however much we approximate the time of judgment to the time of the
deed we never get a conception of freedom in time for if i examine an
action committed a second ago i must still recognize it as not being
free for it is irrevocably linked to the moment at which it was
committed can i lift my arm i lift it but ask myself could i have
abstained from lifting my arm at the moment that has already passed to
convince myself of this i do not lift it the next moment but i am not
now abstaining from doing so at the first moment when i asked the
question time has gone by which i could not detain the arm i then
lifted is no longer the same as the arm i now refrain from lifting nor
is the air in which i lifted it the same that now surrounds me the
moment in which the first movement was made is irrevocable and at that
moment i could make only one movement and whatever movement i made
would be the only one that i did not lift my arm a moment later does
not prove that i could have abstained from lifting it then and since i
could make only one movement at that single moment of time it could not
have been any other to imagine it as free it is necessary to imagine
it in the present on the boundary between the past and the futurethat
is outside time which is impossible

 however much the difficulty of understanding the causes may be
increased we never reach a conception of complete freedom that is an
absence of cause however inaccessible to us may be the cause of the
expression of will in any action our own or anothers the first demand
of reason is the assumption of and search for a cause for without a
cause no phenomenon is conceivable i raise my arm to perform an action
independently of any cause but my wish to perform an action without a
cause is the cause of my action

but even ifimagining a man quite exempt from all influences examining
only his momentary action in the present unevoked by any causewe were
to admit so infinitely small a remainder of inevitability as equaled
zero we should even then not have arrived at the conception of complete
freedom in man for a being uninfluenced by the external world standing
outside of time and independent of cause is no longer a man

in the same way we can never imagine the action of a man quite devoid of
freedom and entirely subject to the law of inevitability

 however we may increase our knowledge of the conditions of space in
which man is situated that knowledge can never be complete for the
number of those conditions is as infinite as the infinity of space and
therefore so long as not all the conditions influencing men are defined
there is no complete inevitability but a certain measure of freedom
remains

 however we may prolong the period of time between the action we are
examining and the judgment upon it that period will be finite while
time is infinite and so in this respect too there can never be absolute
inevitability

 however accessible may be the chain of causation of any action we
shall never know the whole chain since it is endless and so again we
never reach absolute inevitability

but besides this even if admitting the remaining minimum of freedom to
equal zero we assumed in some given caseas for instance in that of a
dying man an unborn babe or an idiotcomplete absence of freedom by
so doing we should destroy the very conception of man in the case we are
examining for as soon as there is no freedom there is also no man and
so the conception of the action of a man subject solely to the law of
inevitability without any element of freedom is just as impossible as
the conception of a mans completely free action

and so to imagine the action of a man entirely subject to the law of
inevitability without any freedom we must assume the knowledge of an
infinite number of space relations an infinitely long period of time
and an infinite series of causes

to imagine a man perfectly free and not subject to the law of
inevitability we must imagine him all alone beyond space beyond time
and free from dependence on cause

in the first case if inevitability were possible without freedom we
should have reached a definition of inevitability by the laws of
inevitability itself that is a mere form without content

in the second case if freedom were possible without inevitability we
should have arrived at unconditioned freedom beyond space time and
cause which by the fact of its being unconditioned and unlimited would
be nothing or mere content without form

we should in fact have reached those two fundamentals of which mans
whole outlook on the universe is constructedthe incomprehensible
essence of life and the laws defining that essence

reason says  space with all the forms of matter that give it
visibility is infinite and cannot be imagined otherwise  time is
infinite motion without a moment of rest and is unthinkable otherwise
 the connection between cause and effect has no beginning and can
have no end

consciousness says  i alone am and all that exists is but me
consequently i include space  i measure flowing time by the fixed
moment of the present in which alone i am conscious of myself as living
consequently i am outside time  i am beyond cause for i feel myself
to be the cause of every manifestation of my life

reason gives expression to the laws of inevitability consciousness
gives expression to the essence of freedom

freedom not limited by anything is the essence of life in mans
consciousness inevitability without content is mans reason in its
three forms

freedom is the thing examined inevitability is what examines freedom
is the content inevitability is the form

only by separating the two sources of cognition related to one another
as form to content do we get the mutually exclusive and separately
incomprehensible conceptions of freedom and inevitability

only by uniting them do we get a clear conception of mans life

apart from these two concepts which in their union mutually define one
another as form and content no conception of life is possible

all that we know of the life of man is merely a certain relation of free
will to inevitability that is of consciousness to the laws of reason

all that we know of the external world of nature is only a certain
relation of the forces of nature to inevitability or of the essence of
life to the laws of reason

the great natural forces lie outside us and we are not conscious of
them we call those forces gravitation inertia electricity animal
force and so on but we are conscious of the force of life in man and
we call that freedom

but just as the force of gravitation incomprehensible in itself but
felt by every man is understood by us only to the extent to which we
know the laws of inevitability to which it is subject from the first
knowledge that all bodies have weight up to newtons law so too the
force of free will incomprehensible in itself but of which everyone is
conscious is intelligible to us only in as far as we know the laws of
inevitability to which it is subject from the fact that every man dies
up to the knowledge of the most complex economic and historic laws

all knowledge is merely a bringing of this essence of life under the
laws of reason

mans free will differs from every other force in that man is directly
conscious of it but in the eyes of reason it in no way differs from any
other force the forces of gravitation electricity or chemical
affinity are only distinguished from one another in that they are
differently defined by reason just so the force of mans free will is
distinguished by reason from the other forces of nature only by the
definition reason gives it freedom apart from necessity that is
apart from the laws of reason that define it differs in no way from
gravitation or heat or the force that makes things grow for reason
it is only a momentary undefinable sensation of life

and as the undefinable essence of the force moving the heavenly bodies
the undefinable essence of the forces of heat and electricity or of
chemical affinity or of the vital force forms the content of
astronomy physics chemistry botany zoology and so on just in the
same way does the force of free will form the content of history but
just as the subject of every science is the manifestation of this
unknown essence of life while that essence itself can only be the
subject of metaphysics even the manifestation of the force of free will
in human beings in space in time and in dependence on cause forms the
subject of history while free will itself is the subject of
metaphysics

in the experimental sciences what we know we call the laws of
inevitability what is unknown to us we call vital force vital force is
only an expression for the unknown remainder over and above what we know
of the essence of life

so also in history what is known to us we call laws of inevitability
what is unknown we call free will free will is for history only an
expression for the unknown remainder of what we know about the laws of
human life





chapter xi

history examines the manifestations of mans free will in connection
with the external world in time and in dependence on cause that is it
defines this freedom by the laws of reason and so history is a science
only in so far as this free will is defined by those laws

the recognition of mans free will as something capable of influencing
historical events that is as not subject to laws is the same for
history as the recognition of a free force moving the heavenly bodies
would be for astronomy

that assumption would destroy the possibility of the existence of laws
that is of any science whatever if there is even a single body moving
freely then the laws of kepler and newton are negatived and no
conception of the movement of the heavenly bodies any longer exists if
any single action is due to free will then not a single historical law
can exist nor any conception of historical events

for history lines exist of the movement of human wills one end of
which is hidden in the unknown but at the other end of which a
consciousness of mans will in the present moves in space time and
dependence on cause

the more this field of motion spreads out before our eyes the more
evident are the laws of that movement to discover and define those laws
is the problem of history

from the standpoint from which the science of history now regards its
subject on the path it now follows seeking the causes of events in
mans freewill a scientific enunciation of those laws is impossible
for however mans free will may be restricted as soon as we recognize
it as a force not subject to law the existence of law becomes
impossible

only by reducing this element of free will to the infinitesimal that
is by regarding it as an infinitely small quantity can we convince
ourselves of the absolute inaccessibility of the causes and then
instead of seeking causes history will take the discovery of laws as
its problem

the search for these laws has long been begun and the new methods of
thought which history must adopt are being worked out simultaneously
with the selfdestruction toward whichever dissecting and dissecting
the causes of phenomenathe old method of history is moving

all human sciences have traveled along that path arriving at
infinitesimals mathematics the most exact of sciences abandons the
process of analysis and enters on the new process of the integration of
unknown infinitely small quantities abandoning the conception of
cause mathematics seeks law that is the property common to all
unknown infinitely small elements

in another form but along the same path of reflection the other sciences
have proceeded when newton enunciated the law of gravity he did not say
that the sun or the earth had a property of attraction he said that all
bodies from the largest to the smallest have the property of attracting
one another that is leaving aside the question of the cause of the
movement of the bodies he expressed the property common to all bodies
from the infinitely large to the infinitely small the same is done by
the natural sciences leaving aside the question of cause they seek for
laws history stands on the same path and if history has for its object
the study of the movement of the nations and of humanity and not the
narration of episodes in the lives of individuals it too setting aside
the conception of cause should seek the laws common to all the
inseparably interconnected infinitesimal elements of free will





chapter xii

from the time the law of copernicus was discovered and proved the mere
recognition of the fact that it was not the sun but the earth that moves
sufficed to destroy the whole cosmography of the ancients by disproving
that law it might have been possible to retain the old conception of the
movements of the bodies but without disproving it it would seem
impossible to continue studying the ptolemaic worlds but even after the
discovery of the law of copernicus the ptolemaic worlds were still
studied for a long time

from the time the first person said and proved that the number of births
or of crimes is subject to mathematical laws and that this or that mode
of government is determined by certain geographical and economic
conditions and that certain relations of population to soil produce
migrations of peoples the foundations on which history had been built
were destroyed in their essence

by refuting these new laws the former view of history might have been
retained but without refuting them it would seem impossible to continue
studying historic events as the results of mans free will for if a
certain mode of government was established or certain migrations of
peoples took place in consequence of such and such geographic
ethnographic or economic conditions then the free will of those
individuals who appear to us to have established that mode of government
or occasioned the migrations can no longer be regarded as the cause

and yet the former history continues to be studied side by side with the
laws of statistics geography political economy comparative philology
and geology which directly contradict its assumptions

the struggle between the old views and the new was long and stubbornly
fought out in physical philosophy theology stood on guard for the old
views and accused the new of violating revelation but when truth
conquered theology established itself just as firmly on the new
foundation

just as prolonged and stubborn is the struggle now proceeding between
the old and the new conception of history and theology in the same way
stands on guard for the old view and accuses the new view of subverting
revelation

in the one case as in the other on both sides the struggle provokes
passion and stifles truth on the one hand there is fear and regret for
the loss of the whole edifice constructed through the ages on the other
is the passion for destruction

to the men who fought against the rising truths of physical philosophy
it seemed that if they admitted that truth it would destroy faith in
god in the creation of the firmament and in the miracle of joshua the
son of nun to the defenders of the laws of copernicus and newton to
voltaire for example it seemed that the laws of astronomy destroyed
religion and he utilized the law of gravitation as a weapon against
religion

just so it now seems as if we have only to admit the law of
inevitability to destroy the conception of the soul of good and evil
and all the institutions of state and church that have been built up on
those conceptions

so too like voltaire in his time uninvited defenders of the law of
inevitability today use that law as a weapon against religion though
the law of inevitability in history like the law of copernicus in
astronomy far from destroying even strengthens the foundation on which
the institutions of state and church are erected

as in the question of astronomy then so in the question of history now
the whole difference of opinion is based on the recognition or
nonrecognition of something absolute serving as the measure of visible
phenomena in astronomy it was the immovability of the earth in history
it is the independence of personalityfree will

as with astronomy the difficulty of recognizing the motion of the earth
lay in abandoning the immediate sensation of the earths fixity and of
the motion of the planets so in history the difficulty of recognizing
the subjection of personality to the laws of space time and cause lies
in renouncing the direct feeling of the independence of ones own
personality but as in astronomy the new view said it is true that we
do not feel the movement of the earth but by admitting its immobility
we arrive at absurdity while by admitting its motion which we do not
feel we arrive at laws so also in history the new view says it is
true that we are not conscious of our dependence but by admitting our
free will we arrive at absurdity while by admitting our dependence on
the external world on time and on cause we arrive at laws

in the first case it was necessary to renounce the consciousness of an
unreal immobility in space and to recognize a motion we did not feel in
the present case it is similarly necessary to renounce a freedom that
does not exist and to recognize a dependence of which we are not
conscious
