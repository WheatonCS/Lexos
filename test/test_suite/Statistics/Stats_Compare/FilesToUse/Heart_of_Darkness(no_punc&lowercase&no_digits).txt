the nellie a cruising yawl swung to her anchor without a flutter of
the sails and was at rest the flood had made the wind was nearly
calm and being bound down the river the only thing for it was to come
to and wait for the turn of the tide

the seareach of the thames stretched before us like the beginning of
an interminable waterway in the offing the sea and the sky were welded
together without a joint and in the luminous space the tanned sails
of the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand still in red
clusters of canvas sharply peaked with gleams of varnished sprits a
haze rested on the low shores that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness
the air was dark above gravesend and farther back still seemed
condensed into a mournful gloom brooding motionless over the biggest
and the greatest town on earth

the director of companies was our captain and our host we four
affectionately watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to
seaward on the whole river there was nothing that looked half so
nautical he resembled a pilot which to a seaman is trustworthiness
personified it was difficult to realize his work was not out there in
the luminous estuary but behind him within the brooding gloom

between us there was as i have already said somewhere the bond of
the sea besides holding our hearts together through long periods of
separation it had the effect of making us tolerant of each others
yarnsand even convictions the lawyerthe best of old fellowshad
because of his many years and many virtues the only cushion on deck
and was lying on the only rug the accountant had brought out already a
box of dominoes and was toying architecturally with the bones marlow
sat crosslegged right aft leaning against the mizzenmast he had
sunken cheeks a yellow complexion a straight back an ascetic aspect
and with his arms dropped the palms of hands outwards resembled an
idol the director satisfied the anchor had good hold made his way
aft and sat down amongst us we exchanged a few words lazily afterwards
there was silence on board the yacht for some reason or other we did
not begin that game of dominoes we felt meditative and fit for nothing
but placid staring the day was ending in a serenity of still and
exquisite brilliance the water shone pacifically the sky without a
speck was a benign immensity of unstained light the very mist on the
essex marshes was like a gauzy and radiant fabric hung from the wooded
rises inland and draping the low shores in diaphanous folds only the
gloom to the west brooding over the upper reaches became more somber
every minute as if angered by the approach of the sun

and at last in its curved and imperceptible fall the sun sank low and
from glowing white changed to a dull red without rays and without heat
as if about to go out suddenly stricken to death by the touch of that
gloom brooding over a crowd of men

forthwith a change came over the waters and the serenity became less
brilliant but more profound the old river in its broad reach rested
unruffled at the decline of day after ages of good service done to the
race that peopled its banks spread out in the tranquil dignity of a
waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth we looked at the
venerable stream not in the vivid flush of a short day that comes and
departs for ever but in the august light of abiding memories and
indeed nothing is easier for a man who has as the phrase goes
followed the sea with reverence and affection than to evoke the
great spirit of the past upon the lower reaches of the thames the tidal
current runs to and fro in its unceasing service crowded with memories
of men and ships it had borne to the rest of home or to the battles
of the sea it had known and served all the men of whom the nation is
proud from sir francis drake to sir john franklin knights all titled
and untitledthe great knightserrant of the sea it had borne all the
ships whose names are like jewels flashing in the night of time from
the golden hind returning with her round flanks full of treasure to be
visited by the queens highness and thus pass out of the gigantic tale
to the erebus and terror bound on other conquestsand that never
returned it had known the ships and the men they had sailed from
deptford from greenwich from eriththe adventurers and the settlers
kings ships and the ships of men on change captains admirals the
dark interlopers of the eastern trade and the commissioned generals
of east india fleets hunters for gold or pursuers of fame they all
had gone out on that stream bearing the sword and often the torch
messengers of the might within the land bearers of a spark from the
sacred fire what greatness had not floated on the ebb of that river
into the mystery of an unknown earth    the dreams of men the seed
of commonwealths the germs of empires

the sun set the dusk fell on the stream and lights began to appear
along the shore the chapman lighthouse a threelegged thing erect on a
mudflat shone strongly lights of ships moved in the fairwaya great
stir of lights going up and going down and farther west on the upper
reaches the place of the monstrous town was still marked ominously on
the sky a brooding gloom in sunshine a lurid glare under the stars

and this also said marlow suddenly has been one of the dark places
of the earth

he was the only man of us who still followed the sea the worst that
could be said of him was that he did not represent his class he was a
seaman but he was a wanderer too while most seamen lead if one may
so express it a sedentary life their minds are of the stayathome
order and their home is always with themthe ship and so is their
countrythe sea one ship is very much like another and the sea is
always the same in the immutability of their surroundings the foreign
shores the foreign faces the changing immensity of life glide past
veiled not by a sense of mystery but by a slightly disdainful ignorance
for there is nothing mysterious to a seaman unless it be the sea itself
which is the mistress of his existence and as inscrutable as destiny
for the rest after his hours of work a casual stroll or a casual spree
on shore suffices to unfold for him the secret of a whole continent
and generally he finds the secret not worth knowing the yarns of seamen
have a direct simplicity the whole meaning of which lies within the
shell of a cracked nut but marlow was not typical if his propensity
to spin yarns be excepted and to him the meaning of an episode was not
inside like a kernel but outside enveloping the tale which brought it
out only as a glow brings out a haze in the likeness of one of these
misty halos that sometimes are made visible by the spectral illumination
of moonshine

his remark did not seem at all surprising it was just like marlow
it was accepted in silence no one took the trouble to grunt even and
presently he said very slow

i was thinking of very old times when the romans first came here
nineteen hundred years agothe other day    light came out of this
river sinceyou say knights yes but it is like a running blaze on
a plain like a flash of lightning in the clouds we live in the
flickermay it last as long as the old earth keeps rolling but
darkness was here yesterday imagine the feelings of a commander of
a finewhat dye call emtrireme in the mediterranean ordered
suddenly to the north run overland across the gauls in a hurry put in
charge of one of these craft the legionariesa wonderful lot of handy
men they must have been tooused to build apparently by the hundred
in a month or two if we may believe what we read imagine him herethe
very end of the world a sea the color of lead a sky the color of
smoke a kind of ship about as rigid as a concertinaand going up this
river with stores or orders or what you like sandbanks marshes
forests savagesprecious little to eat fit for a civilized man
nothing but thames water to drink no falernian wine here no going
ashore here and there a military camp lost in a wilderness like a
needle in a bundle of haycold fog tempests disease exile and
deathdeath skulking in the air in the water in the bush they must
have been dying like flies here oh yeshe did it did it very well
too no doubt and without thinking much about it either except
afterwards to brag of what he had gone through in his time perhaps
they were men enough to face the darkness and perhaps he was cheered
by keeping his eye on a chance of promotion to the fleet at ravenna
byandby if he had good friends in rome and survived the awful
climate or think of a decent young citizen in a togaperhaps too
much dice you knowcoming out here in the train of some prefect or
taxgatherer or trader even to mend his fortunes land in a swamp
march through the woods and in some inland post feel the savagery the
utter savagery had closed round himall that mysterious life of the
wilderness that stirs in the forest in the jungles in the hearts of
wild men theres no initiation either into such mysteries he has to
live in the midst of the incomprehensible which is also detestable and
it has a fascination too that goes to work upon him the fascination
of the abominationyou know imagine the growing regrets the longing
to escape the powerless disgust the surrender the hate

he paused

mind he began again lifting one arm from the elbow the palm of the
hand outwards so that with his legs folded before him he had the
pose of a buddha preaching in european clothes and without a
lotusflowermind none of us would feel exactly like this what saves
us is efficiencythe devotion to efficiency but these chaps were not
much account really they were no colonists their administration was
merely a squeeze and nothing more i suspect they were conquerors and
for that you want only brute forcenothing to boast of when you have
it since your strength is just an accident arising from the weakness of
others they grabbed what they could get for the sake of what was to
be got it was just robbery with violence aggravated murder on a great
scale and men going at it blindas is very proper for those who tackle
a darkness the conquest of the earth which mostly means the taking
it away from those who have a different complexion or slightly flatter
noses than ourselves is not a pretty thing when you look into it too
much what redeems it is the idea only an idea at the back of it not
a sentimental pretense but an idea and an unselfish belief in the
ideasomething you can set up and bow down before and offer a
sacrifice to

he broke off flames glided in the river small green flames red
flames white flames pursuing overtaking joining crossing each
otherthen separating slowly or hastily the traffic of the great city
went on in the deepening night upon the sleepless river we looked on
waiting patientlythere was nothing else to do till the end of
the flood but it was only after a long silence when he said in
a hesitating voice i suppose you fellows remember i did once turn
freshwater sailor for a bit that we knew we were fated before
the ebb began to run to hear about one of marlows inconclusive
experiences

i dont want to bother you much with what happened to me personally
he began showing in this remark the weakness of many tellers of tales
who seem so often unaware of what their audience would best like to
hear yet to understand the effect of it on me you ought to know how i
got out there what i saw how i went up that river to the place where i
first met the poor chap it was the farthest point of navigation and the
culminating point of my experience it seemed somehow to throw a kind of
light on everything about meand into my thoughts it was somber enough
tooand pitifulnot extraordinary in any waynot very clear either
no not very clear and yet it seemed to throw a kind of light

i had then as you remember just returned to london after a lot of
indian ocean pacific china seasa regular dose of the eastsix years
or so and i was loafing about hindering you fellows in your work and
invading your homes just as though i had got a heavenly mission to
civilize you it was very fine for a time but after a bit i did get
tired of resting then i began to look for a shipi should think the
hardest work on earth but the ships wouldnt even look at me and i got
tired of that game too

now when i was a little chap i had a passion for maps i would look for
hours at south america or africa or australia and lose myself in all
the glories of exploration at that time there were many blank spaces on
the earth and when i saw one that looked particularly inviting on a map
but they all look that i would put my finger on it and say when
i grow up i will go there the north pole was one of these places i
remember well i havent been there yet and shall not try now the
glamours off other places were scattered about the equator and in
every sort of latitude all over the two hemispheres i have been in some
of them and    well we wont talk about that but there was one
yetthe biggest the most blank so to speakthat i had a hankering
after

true by this time it was not a blank space any more it had got filled
since my boyhood with rivers and lakes and names it had ceased to be
a blank space of delightful mysterya white patch for a boy to dream
gloriously over it had become a place of darkness but there was in it
one river especially a mighty big river that you could see on the map
resembling an immense snake uncoiled with its head in the sea its
body at rest curving afar over a vast country and its tail lost in the
depths of the land and as i looked at the map of it in a shopwindow
it fascinated me as a snake would a birda silly little bird then i
remembered there was a big concern a company for trade on that river
dash it all i thought to myself they cant trade without using some
kind of craft on that lot of fresh watersteamboats why shouldnt i
try to get charge of one i went on along fleet street but could not
shake off the idea the snake had charmed me

you understand it was a continental concern that trading society but
i have a lot of relations living on the continent because its cheap
and not so nasty as it looks they say

i am sorry to own i began to worry them this was already a fresh
departure for me i was not used to get things that way you know i
always went my own road and on my own legs where i had a mind to go i
wouldnt have believed it of myself but thenyou seei felt somehow
i must get there by hook or by crook so i worried them the men said
my dear fellow and did nothing thenwould you believe iti tried
the women i charlie marlow set the women to workto get a job
heavens well you see the notion drove me i had an aunt a dear
enthusiastic soul she wrote it will be delightful i am ready to do
anything anything for you it is a glorious idea i know the wife of a
very high personage in the administration and also a man who has lots
of influence with c c she was determined to make no end of fuss
to get me appointed skipper of a river steamboat if such was my fancy

i got my appointmentof course and i got it very quick it appears
the company had received news that one of their captains had been killed
in a scuffle with the natives this was my chance and it made me the
more anxious to go it was only months and months afterwards when i
made the attempt to recover what was left of the body that i heard the
original quarrel arose from a misunderstanding about some hens yes
two black hens fresleventhat was the fellows name a danethought
himself wronged somehow in the bargain so he went ashore and started to
hammer the chief of the village with a stick oh it didnt surprise
me in the least to hear this and at the same time to be told that
fresleven was the gentlest quietest creature that ever walked on two
legs no doubt he was but he had been a couple of years already out
there engaged in the noble cause you know and he probably felt the
need at last of asserting his selfrespect in some way therefore he
whacked the old nigger mercilessly while a big crowd of his people
watched him thunderstruck till some mani was told the chiefs
sonin desperation at hearing the old chap yell made a tentative jab
with a spear at the white manand of course it went quite easy between
the shoulderblades then the whole population cleared into the forest
expecting all kinds of calamities to happen while on the other hand
the steamer fresleven commanded left also in a bad panic in charge of
the engineer i believe afterwards nobody seemed to trouble much
about freslevens remains till i got out and stepped into his shoes i
couldnt let it rest though but when an opportunity offered at last to
meet my predecessor the grass growing through his ribs was tall enough
to hide his bones they were all there the supernatural being had not
been touched after he fell and the village was deserted the huts gaped
black rotting all askew within the fallen enclosures a calamity
had come to it sure enough the people had vanished mad terror had
scattered them men women and children through the bush and they had
never returned what became of the hens i dont know either i should
think the cause of progress got them anyhow however through this
glorious affair i got my appointment before i had fairly begun to hope
for it

i flew around like mad to get ready and before fortyeight hours i
was crossing the channel to show myself to my employers and sign the
contract in a very few hours i arrived in a city that always makes me
think of a whited sepulcher prejudice no doubt i had no difficulty in
finding the companys offices it was the biggest thing in the town
and everybody i met was full of it they were going to run an oversea
empire and make no end of coin by trade

a narrow and deserted street in deep shadow high houses innumerable
windows with venetian blinds a dead silence grass sprouting between
the stones imposing carriage archways right and left immense double
doors standing ponderously ajar i slipped through one of these cracks
went up a swept and ungarnished staircase as arid as a desert and
opened the first door i came to two women one fat and the other slim
sat on strawbottomed chairs knitting black wool the slim one got up
and walked straight at mestill knitting with downcast eyesand only
just as i began to think of getting out of her way as you would for a
somnambulist stood still and looked up her dress was as plain as an
umbrellacover and she turned round without a word and preceded me
into a waitingroom i gave my name and looked about deal table in
the middle plain chairs all round the walls on one end a large shining
map marked with all the colors of a rainbow there was a vast amount of
redgood to see at any time because one knows that some real work
is done in there a deuce of a lot of blue a little green smears of
orange and on the east coast a purple patch to show where the jolly
pioneers of progress drink the jolly lagerbeer however i wasnt going
into any of these i was going into the yellow dead in the center and
the river was therefascinatingdeadlylike a snake ough a door
opened a whitehaired secretarial head but wearing a compassionate
expression appeared and a skinny forefinger beckoned me into the
sanctuary its light was dim and a heavy writingdesk squatted in
the middle from behind that structure came out an impression of pale
plumpness in a frockcoat the great man himself he was five feet
six i should judge and had his grip on the handleend of ever so many
millions he shook hands i fancy murmured vaguely was satisfied with
my french bon voyage

in about fortyfive seconds i found myself again in the waitingroom
with the compassionate secretary who full of desolation and sympathy
made me sign some document i believe i undertook amongst other things
not to disclose any trade secrets well i am not going to

i began to feel slightly uneasy you know i am not used to such
ceremonies and there was something ominous in the atmosphere it
was just as though i had been let into some conspiracyi dont
knowsomething not quite right and i was glad to get out in the outer
room the two women knitted black wool feverishly people were arriving
and the younger one was walking back and forth introducing them the
old one sat on her chair her flat cloth slippers were propped up on
a footwarmer and a cat reposed on her lap she wore a starched
white affair on her head had a wart on one cheek and silverrimmed
spectacles hung on the tip of her nose she glanced at me above the
glasses the swift and indifferent placidity of that look troubled me
two youths with foolish and cheery countenances were being piloted over
and she threw at them the same quick glance of unconcerned wisdom she
seemed to know all about them and about me too an eerie feeling came
over me she seemed uncanny and fateful often far away there i thought
of these two guarding the door of darkness knitting black wool as for
a warm pall one introducing introducing continuously to the unknown
the other scrutinizing the cheery and foolish faces with unconcerned old
eyes ave old knitter of black wool morituri te salutant not many of
those she looked at ever saw her againnot half by a long way

there was yet a visit to the doctor a simple formality assured me
the secretary with an air of taking an immense part in all my sorrows
accordingly a young chap wearing his hat over the left eyebrow some
clerk i supposethere must have been clerks in the business though
the house was as still as a house in a city of the deadcame from
somewhere upstairs and led me forth he was shabby and careless with
inkstains on the sleeves of his jacket and his cravat was large and
billowy under a chin shaped like the toe of an old boot it was a
little too early for the doctor so i proposed a drink and thereupon he
developed a vein of joviality as we sat over our vermouths he glorified
the companys business and byandby i expressed casually my surprise
at him not going out there he became very cool and collected all at
once i am not such a fool as i look quoth plato to his disciples
he said sententiously emptied his glass with great resolution and we
rose

the old doctor felt my pulse evidently thinking of something else
the while good good for there he mumbled and then with a certain
eagerness asked me whether i would let him measure my head rather
surprised i said yes when he produced a thing like calipers and got
the dimensions back and front and every way taking notes carefully he
was an unshaven little man in a threadbare coat like a gaberdine with
his feet in slippers and i thought him a harmless fool i always ask
leave in the interests of science to measure the crania of those going
out there he said and when they come back too i asked oh i
never see them he remarked and moreover the changes take place
inside you know he smiled as if at some quiet joke so you are
going out there famous interesting too he gave me a searching
glance and made another note ever any madness in your family he
asked in a matteroffact tone i felt very annoyed is that question
in the interests of science too it would be he said without taking
notice of my irritation interesting for science to watch the mental
changes of individuals on the spot but    are you an alienist i
interrupted every doctor should bea little answered that original
imperturbably i have a little theory which you messieurs who go out
there must help me to prove this is my share in the advantages my
country shall reap from the possession of such a magnificent dependency
the mere wealth i leave to others pardon my questions but you are
the first englishman coming under my observation    i hastened
to assure him i was not in the least typical if i were said i
i wouldnt be talking like this with you what you say is rather
profound and probably erroneous he said with a laugh avoid
irritation more than exposure to the sun adieu how do you english
say eh goodby ah goodby adieu in the tropics one must before
everything keep calm    he lifted a warning forefinger    du
calme du calme adieu

one thing more remained to dosay goodby to my excellent aunt i
found her triumphant i had a cup of teathe last decent cup of tea for
many daysand in a room that most soothingly looked just as you would
expect a ladys drawingroom to look we had a long quiet chat by the
fireside in the course of these confidences it became quite plain to me
i had been represented to the wife of the high dignitary and goodness
knows to how many more people besides as an exceptional and gifted
creaturea piece of good fortune for the companya man you dont get
hold of every day good heavens and i was going to take charge of a
twopennyhalfpenny riversteamboat with a penny whistle attached it
appeared however i was also one of the workers with a capitalyou
know something like an emissary of light something like a lower sort
of apostle there had been a lot of such rot let loose in print and talk
just about that time and the excellent woman living right in the rush
of all that humbug got carried off her feet she talked about weaning
those ignorant millions from their horrid ways till upon my word she
made me quite uncomfortable i ventured to hint that the company was run
for profit

you forget dear charlie that the laborer is worthy of his hire she
said brightly its queer how out of touch with truth women are they
live in a world of their own and there had never been anything like it
and never can be it is too beautiful altogether and if they were to
set it up it would go to pieces before the first sunset some confounded
fact we men have been living contentedly with ever since the day of
creation would start up and knock the whole thing over

after this i got embraced told to wear flannel be sure to write
often and so onand i left in the streeti dont know whya queer
feeling came to me that i was an impostor odd thing that i who used to
clear out for any part of the world at twentyfour hours notice with
less thought than most men give to the crossing of a street had a
momenti wont say of hesitation but of startled pause before this
commonplace affair the best way i can explain it to you is by saying
that for a second or two i felt as though instead of going to the
center of a continent i were about to set off for the center of the
earth

i left in a french steamer and she called in every blamed port they
have out there for as far as i could see the sole purpose of landing
soldiers and customhouse officers i watched the coast watching a
coast as it slips by the ship is like thinking about an enigma there
it is before yousmiling frowning inviting grand mean insipid or
savage and always mute with an air of whispering come and find out
this one was almost featureless as if still in the making with
an aspect of monotonous grimness the edge of a colossal jungle so
darkgreen as to be almost black fringed with white surf ran straight
like a ruled line far far away along a blue sea whose glitter was
blurred by a creeping mist the sun was fierce the land seemed to
glisten and drip with steam here and there grayishwhitish specks
showed up clustered inside the white surf with a flag flying above
them perhaps settlements some centuries old and still no bigger than
pinheads on the untouched expanse of their background we pounded
along stopped landed soldiers went on landed customhouse clerks to
levy toll in what looked like a godforsaken wilderness with a tin shed
and a flagpole lost in it landed more soldiersto take care of the
customhouse clerks presumably some i heard got drowned in the surf
but whether they did or not nobody seemed particularly to care they
were just flung out there and on we went every day the coast
looked the same as though we had not moved but we passed various
placestrading placeswith names like gran bassam little popo names
that seemed to belong to some sordid farce acted in front of a sinister
backcloth the idleness of a passenger my isolation amongst all these
men with whom i had no point of contact the oily and languid sea the
uniform somberness of the coast seemed to keep me away from the truth
of things within the toil of a mournful and senseless delusion the
voice of the surf heard now and then was a positive pleasure like the
speech of a brother it was something natural that had its reason that
had a meaning now and then a boat from the shore gave one a momentary
contact with reality it was paddled by black fellows you could see
from afar the white of their eyeballs glistening they shouted sang
their bodies streamed with perspiration they had faces like grotesque
masksthese chaps but they had bone muscle a wild vitality an
intense energy of movement that was as natural and true as the surf
along their coast they wanted no excuse for being there they were a
great comfort to look at for a time i would feel i belonged still to
a world of straightforward facts but the feeling would not last long
something would turn up to scare it away once i remember we came upon
a manofwar anchored off the coast there wasnt even a shed there and
she was shelling the bush it appears the french had one of their wars
going on thereabouts her ensign dropped limp like a rag the muzzles
of the long eightinch guns stuck out all over the low hull the greasy
slimy swell swung her up lazily and let her down swaying her thin
masts in the empty immensity of earth sky and water there she was
incomprehensible firing into a continent pop would go one of the
eightinch guns a small flame would dart and vanish a little
white smoke would disappear a tiny projectile would give a feeble
screechand nothing happened nothing could happen there was a touch
of insanity in the proceeding a sense of lugubrious drollery in the
sight and it was not dissipated by somebody on board assuring me
earnestly there was a camp of nativeshe called them enemieshidden
out of sight somewhere

we gave her her letters i heard the men in that lonely ship were dying
of fever at the rate of three a day and went on we called at some more
places with farcical names where the merry dance of death and trade
goes on in a still and earthy atmosphere as of an overheated catacomb
all along the formless coast bordered by dangerous surf as if nature
herself had tried to ward off intruders in and out of rivers streams
of death in life whose banks were rotting into mud whose waters
thickened into slime invaded the contorted mangroves that seemed to
writhe at us in the extremity of an impotent despair nowhere did we
stop long enough to get a particularized impression but the general
sense of vague and oppressive wonder grew upon me it was like a weary
pilgrimage amongst hints for nightmares

it was upward of thirty days before i saw the mouth of the big river
we anchored off the seat of the government but my work would not begin
till some two hundred miles farther on so as soon as i could i made a
start for a place thirty miles higher up

i had my passage on a little seagoing steamer her captain was a
swede and knowing me for a seaman invited me on the bridge he was a
young man lean fair and morose with lanky hair and a shuffling gait
as we left the miserable little wharf he tossed his head contemptuously
at the shore been living there he asked i said yes fine lot
these government chapsare they not he went on speaking english
with great precision and considerable bitterness it is funny what some
people will do for a few francs a month i wonder what becomes of that
kind when it goes up country i said to him i expected to see that
soon sooo he exclaimed he shuffled athwart keeping one eye ahead
vigilantly dont be too sure he continued the other day i took
up a man who hanged himself on the road he was a swede too
hanged himself why in gods name i cried he kept on looking
out watchfully who knows the sun too much for him or the country
perhaps

at last we opened a reach a rocky cliff appeared mounds of turnedup
earth by the shore houses on a hill others with iron roofs amongst a
waste of excavations or hanging to the declivity a continuous noise of
the rapids above hovered over this scene of inhabited devastation a
lot of people mostly black and naked moved about like ants a jetty
projected into the river a blinding sunlight drowned all this at times
in a sudden recrudescence of glare theres your companys station
said the swede pointing to three wooden barracklike structures on the
rocky slope i will send your things up four boxes did you say so
farewell

i came upon a boiler wallowing in the grass then found a path
leading up the hill it turned aside for the bowlders and also for an
undersized railwaytruck lying there on its back with its wheels in
the air one was off the thing looked as dead as the carcass of some
animal i came upon more pieces of decaying machinery a stack of rusty
rails to the left a clump of trees made a shady spot where dark things
seemed to stir feebly i blinked the path was steep a horn tooted to
the right and i saw the black people run a heavy and dull detonation
shook the ground a puff of smoke came out of the cliff and that was
all no change appeared on the face of the rock they were building a
railway the cliff was not in the way or anything but this objectless
blasting was all the work going on

a slight clinking behind me made me turn my head six black men
advanced in a file toiling up the path they walked erect and slow
balancing small baskets full of earth on their heads and the clink kept
time with their footsteps black rags were wound round their loins and
the short ends behind wagged to and fro like tails i could see every
rib the joints of their limbs were like knots in a rope each had an
iron collar on his neck and all were connected together with a chain
whose bights swung between them rhythmically clinking another report
from the cliff made me think suddenly of that ship of war i had seen
firing into a continent it was the same kind of ominous voice but
these men could by no stretch of imagination be called enemies they
were called criminals and the outraged law like the bursting shells
had come to them an insoluble mystery from over the sea all their
meager breasts panted together the violently dilated nostrils quivered
the eyes stared stonily uphill they passed me within six inches
without a glance with that complete deathlike indifference of unhappy
savages behind this raw matter one of the reclaimed the product of
the new forces at work strolled despondently carrying a rifle by its
middle he had a uniform jacket with one button off and seeing a white
man on the path hoisted his weapon to his shoulder with alacrity this
was simple prudence white men being so much alike at a distance that
he could not tell who i might be he was speedily reassured and with a
large white rascally grin and a glance at his charge seemed to take
me into partnership in his exalted trust after all i also was a part
of the great cause of these high and just proceedings

instead of going up i turned and descended to the left my idea was to
let that chaingang get out of sight before i climbed the hill you know
i am not particularly tender ive had to strike and to fend off
ive had to resist and to attack sometimesthats only one way of
resistingwithout counting the exact cost according to the demands
of such sort of life as i had blundered into ive seen the devil of
violence and the devil of greed and the devil of hot desire but by
all the stars these were strong lusty redeyed devils that swayed
and drove menmen i tell you but as i stood on this hillside i
foresaw that in the blinding sunshine of that land i would become
acquainted with a flabby pretending weakeyed devil of a rapacious and
pitiless folly how insidious he could be too i was only to find out
several months later and a thousand miles farther for a moment i
stood appalled as though by a warning finally i descended the hill
obliquely towards the trees i had seen

i avoided a vast artificial hole somebody had been digging on the
slope the purpose of which i found it impossible to divine it wasnt
a quarry or a sandpit anyhow it was just a hole it might have
been connected with the philanthropic desire of giving the criminals
something to do i dont know then i nearly fell into a very narrow
ravine almost no more than a scar in the hillside i discovered that
a lot of imported drainagepipes for the settlement had been tumbled in
there there wasnt one that was not broken it was a wanton smashup
at last i got under the trees my purpose was to stroll into the shade
for a moment but no sooner within than it seemed to me i had stepped
into a gloomy circle of some inferno the rapids were near and an
uninterrupted uniform headlong rushing noise filled the mournful
stillness of the grove where not a breath stirred not a leaf moved
with a mysterious soundas though the tearing pace of the launched
earth had suddenly become audible

black shapes crouched lay sat between the trees leaning against the
trunks clinging to the earth half coming out half effaced within
the dim light in all the attitudes of pain abandonment and despair
another mine on the cliff went off followed by a slight shudder of the
soil under my feet the work was going on the work and this was the
place where some of the helpers had withdrawn to die

they were dying slowlyit was very clear they were not enemies they
were not criminals they were nothing earthly nownothing but black
shadows of disease and starvation lying confusedly in the greenish
gloom brought from all the recesses of the coast in all the legality
of time contracts lost in uncongenial surroundings fed on unfamiliar
food they sickened became inefficient and were then allowed to crawl
away and rest these moribund shapes were free as airand nearly as
thin i began to distinguish the gleam of eyes under the trees then
glancing down i saw a face near my hand the black bones reclined at
full length with one shoulder against the tree and slowly the eyelids
rose and the sunken eyes looked up at me enormous and vacant a kind of
blind white flicker in the depths of the orbs which died out slowly
the man seemed youngalmost a boybut you know with them its hard to
tell i found nothing else to do but to offer him one of my good swedes
ships biscuits i had in my pocket the fingers closed slowly on it and
heldthere was no other movement and no other glance he had tied a
bit of white worsted round his neckwhy where did he get it was it a
badgean ornamenta charma propitiatory act was there any idea at
all connected with it it looked startling round his black neck this
bit of white thread from beyond the seas

near the same tree two more bundles of acute angles sat with their legs
drawn up one with his chin propped on his knees stared at nothing
in an intolerable and appalling manner his brother phantom rested its
forehead as if overcome with a great weariness and all about others
were scattered in every pose of contorted collapse as in some picture
of a massacre or a pestilence while i stood horrorstruck one of these
creatures rose to his hands and knees and went off on allfours towards
the river to drink he lapped out of his hand then sat up in the
sunlight crossing his shins in front of him and after a time let his
woolly head fall on his breastbone

i didnt want any more loitering in the shade and i made haste towards
the station when near the buildings i met a white man in such an
unexpected elegance of getup that in the first moment i took him for
a sort of vision i saw a high starched collar white cuffs a light
alpaca jacket snowy trousers a clear necktie and varnished boots no
hat hair parted brushed oiled under a greenlined parasol held in a
big white hand he was amazing and had a penholder behind his ear

i shook hands with this miracle and i learned he was the companys
chief accountant and that all the bookkeeping was done at this station
he had come out for a moment he said to get a breath of fresh air
the expression sounded wonderfully odd with its suggestion of sedentary
desklife i wouldnt have mentioned the fellow to you at all only
it was from his lips that i first heard the name of the man who is
so indissolubly connected with the memories of that time moreover i
respected the fellow yes i respected his collars his vast cuffs
his brushed hair his appearance was certainly that of a hairdressers
dummy but in the great demoralization of the land he kept up
his appearance thats backbone his starched collars and gotup
shirtfronts were achievements of character he had been out nearly
three years and later on i could not help asking him how he managed
to sport such linen he had just the faintest blush and said modestly
ive been teaching one of the native women about the station it
was difficult she had a distaste for the work this man had verily
accomplished something and he was devoted to his books which were in
applepie order

everything else in the station was in a muddleheads things
buildings strings of dusty niggers with splay feet arrived and
departed a stream of manufactured goods rubbishy cottons beads
and brasswire sent into the depths of darkness and in return came a
precious trickle of ivory

i had to wait in the station for ten daysan eternity i lived in a
hut in the yard but to be out of the chaos i would sometimes get into
the accountants office it was built of horizontal planks and so badly
put together that as he bent over his high desk he was barred from
neck to heels with narrow strips of sunlight there was no need to
open the big shutter to see it was hot there too big flies buzzed
fiendishly and did not sting but stabbed i sat generally on the
floor while of faultless appearance and even slightly scented
perching on a high stool he wrote he wrote sometimes he stood up for
exercise when a trucklebed with a sick man some invalided agent from
upcountry was put in there he exhibited a gentle annoyance the
groans of this sick person he said distract my attention and without
that it is extremely difficult to guard against clerical errors in this
climate

one day he remarked without lifting his head in the interior you
will no doubt meet mr kurtz on my asking who mr kurtz was he
said he was a firstclass agent and seeing my disappointment at
this information he added slowly laying down his pen he is a very
remarkable person further questions elicited from him that mr kurtz
was at present in charge of a trading post a very important one in the
true ivorycountry at the very bottom of there sends in as much ivory
as all the others put together    he began to write again the sick
man was too ill to groan the flies buzzed in a great peace

suddenly there was a growing murmur of voices and a great tramping of
feet a caravan had come in a violent babble of uncouth sounds burst
out on the other side of the planks all the carriers were speaking
together and in the midst of the uproar the lamentable voice of the
chief agent was heard giving it up tearfully for the twentieth time
that day    he rose slowly what a frightful row he said he
crossed the room gently to look at the sick man and returning said to
me he does not hear what dead i asked startled no not yet
he answered with great composure then alluding with a toss of the
head to the tumult in the stationyard when one has got to make
correct entries one comes to hate those savageshate them to the
death he remained thoughtful for a moment when you see mr kurtz
he went on tell him from me that everything herehe glanced at the
deskis very satisfactory i dont like to write to himwith those
messengers of ours you never know who may get hold of your letterat
that central station he stared at me for a moment with his mild
bulging eyes oh he will go far very far he began again he
will be a somebody in the administration before long they abovethe
council in europe you knowmean him to be

he turned to his work the noise outside had ceased and presently
in going out i stopped at the door in the steady buzz of flies the
homewardbound agent was lying flushed and insensible the other
bent over his books was making correct entries of perfectly correct
transactions and fifty feet below the doorstep i could see the still
treetops of the grove of death

next day i left that station at last with a caravan of sixty men for
a twohundredmile tramp

no use telling you much about that paths paths everywhere a
stampedin network of paths spreading over the empty land through
long grass through burnt grass through thickets down and up chilly
ravines up and down stony hills ablaze with heat and a solitude a
solitude nobody not a hut the population had cleared out a long
time ago well if a lot of mysterious niggers armed with all kinds of
fearful weapons suddenly took to traveling on the road between deal and
gravesend catching the yokels right and left to carry heavy loads for
them i fancy every farm and cottage thereabouts would get empty very
soon only here the dwellings were gone too still i passed through
several abandoned villages theres something pathetically childish in
the ruins of grass walls day after day with the stamp and shuffle of
sixty pair of bare feet behind me each pair under a lb load camp
cook sleep strike camp march now and then a carrier dead in harness
at rest in the long grass near the path with an empty watergourd and
his long staff lying by his side a great silence around and above
perhaps on some quiet night the tremor of faroff drums sinking
swelling a tremor vast faint a sound weird appealing suggestive
and wildand perhaps with as profound a meaning as the sound of bells
in a christian country once a white man in an unbuttoned uniform
camping on the path with an armed escort of lank zanzibaris very
hospitable and festivenot to say drunk was looking after the upkeep
of the road he declared cant say i saw any road or any upkeep unless
the body of a middleaged negro with a bullethole in the forehead
upon which i absolutely stumbled three miles farther on may be
considered as a permanent improvement i had a white companion too not
a bad chap but rather too fleshy and with the exasperating habit of
fainting on the hot hillsides miles away from the least bit of shade
and water annoying you know to hold your own coat like a parasol over
a mans head while he is comingto i couldnt help asking him once what
he meant by coming there at all to make money of course what do you
think he said scornfully then he got fever and had to be carried in
a hammock slung under a pole as he weighed sixteen stone i had no end
of rows with the carriers they jibbed ran away sneaked off with their
loads in the nightquite a mutiny so one evening i made a speech in
english with gestures not one of which was lost to the sixty pairs of
eyes before me and the next morning i started the hammock off in front
all right an hour afterwards i came upon the whole concern wrecked in
a bushman hammock groans blankets horrors the heavy pole had
skinned his poor nose he was very anxious for me to kill somebody
but there wasnt the shadow of a carrier near i remembered the old
doctorit would be interesting for science to watch the mental
changes of individuals on the spot i felt i was becoming
scientifically interesting however all that is to no purpose on the
fifteenth day i came in sight of the big river again and hobbled into
the central station it was on a back water surrounded by scrub and
forest with a pretty border of smelly mud on one side and on the three
others inclosed by a crazy fence of rushes a neglected gap was all the
gate it had and the first glance at the place was enough to let you see
the flabby devil was running that show white men with long staves in
their hands appeared languidly from amongst the buildings strolling up
to take a look at me and then retired out of sight somewhere one of
them a stout excitable chap with black mustaches informed me with
great volubility and many digressions as soon as i told him who i was
that my steamer was at the bottom of the river i was thunderstruck
what how why oh it was all right the manager himself was there
all quite correct everybody had behaved splendidly splendidlyyou
must he said in agitation go and see the general manager at once he
is waiting

i did not see the real significance of that wreck at once i fancy i
see it now but i am not surenot at all certainly the affair was too
stupidwhen i think of itto be altogether natural still    but
at the moment it presented itself simply as a confounded nuisance the
steamer was sunk they had started two days before in a sudden hurry
up the river with the manager on board in charge of some volunteer
skipper and before they had been out three hours they tore the bottom
out of her on stones and she sank near the south bank i asked myself
what i was to do there now my boat was lost as a matter of fact i had
plenty to do in fishing my command out of the river i had to set about
it the very next day that and the repairs when i brought the pieces to
the station took some months

my first interview with the manager was curious he did not ask me to
sit down after my twentymile walk that morning he was commonplace in
complexion in features in manners and in voice he was of middle
size and of ordinary build his eyes of the usual blue were perhaps
remarkably cold and he certainly could make his glance fall on one as
trenchant and heavy as an ax but even at these times the rest of his
person seemed to disclaim the intention otherwise there was only
an indefinable faint expression of his lips something stealthya
smilenot a smilei remember it but i cant explain it was
unconscious this smile was though just after he had said something it
got intensified for an instant it came at the end of his speeches like
a seal applied on the words to make the meaning of the commonest phrase
appear absolutely inscrutable he was a common trader from his youth
up employed in these partsnothing more he was obeyed yet he inspired
neither love nor fear nor even respect he inspired uneasiness that
was it uneasiness not a definite mistrustjust uneasinessnothing
more you have no idea how effective such a    a    faculty can
be he had no genius for organizing for initiative or for order even
that was evident in such things as the deplorable state of the station
he had no learning and no intelligence his position had come to
himwhy perhaps because he was never ill    he had served three
terms of three years out there    because triumphant health in the
general rout of constitutions is a kind of power in itself when he went
home on leave he rioted on a large scalepompously jack ashorewith
a differencein externals only this one could gather from his casual
talk he originated nothing he could keep the routine goingthats
all but he was great he was great by this little thing that it was
impossible to tell what could control such a man he never gave that
secret away perhaps there was nothing within him such a suspicion
made one pausefor out there there were no external checks once when
various tropical diseases had laid low almost every agent in the
station he was heard to say men who come out here should have no
entrails he sealed the utterance with that smile of his as though
it had been a door opening into a darkness he had in his keeping
you fancied you had seen thingsbut the seal was on when annoyed at
mealtimes by the constant quarrels of the white men about precedence
he ordered an immense round table to be made for which a special house
had to be built this was the stations messroom where he sat was the
first placethe rest were nowhere one felt this to be his unalterable
conviction he was neither civil nor uncivil he was quiet he allowed
his boyan overfed young negro from the coastto treat the white
men under his very eyes with provoking insolence

he began to speak as soon as he saw me i had been very long on the
road he could not wait had to start without me the upriver stations
had to be relieved there had been so many delays already that he did
not know who was dead and who was alive and how they got onand so on
and so on he paid no attention to my explanations and playing with
a stick of sealingwax repeated several times that the situation
was very grave very grave there were rumors that a very important
station was in jeopardy and its chief mr kurtz was ill hoped it was
not true mr kurtz was    i felt weary and irritable hang kurtz
i thought i interrupted him by saying i had heard of mr kurtz on the
coast ah so they talk of him down there he murmured to himself
then he began again assuring me mr kurtz was the best agent he had an
exceptional man of the greatest importance to the company therefore
i could understand his anxiety he was he said very very uneasy
certainly he fidgeted on his chair a good deal exclaimed ah mr
kurtz broke the stick of sealingwax and seemed dumbfounded by the
accident next thing he wanted to know how long it would take to
i interrupted him again being hungry you know and kept on my feet
too i was getting savage how could i tell i said i hadnt even
seen the wreck yetsome months no doubt all this talk seemed to me
so futile some months he said well let us say three months before
we can make a start yes that ought to do the affair i flung out
of his hut he lived all alone in a clay hut with a sort of veranda
muttering to myself my opinion of him he was a chattering idiot
afterwards i took it back when it was borne in upon me startlingly
with what extreme nicety he had estimated the time requisite for the
affair

i went to work the next day turning so to speak my back on that
station in that way only it seemed to me i could keep my hold on the
redeeming facts of life still one must look about sometimes and then
i saw this station these men strolling aimlessly about in the sunshine
of the yard i asked myself sometimes what it all meant they wandered
here and there with their absurd long staves in their hands like a lot
of faithless pilgrims bewitched inside a rotten fence the word ivory
rang in the air was whispered was sighed you would think they were
praying to it a taint of imbecile rapacity blew through it all like a
whiff from some corpse by jove ive never seen anything so unreal in
my life and outside the silent wilderness surrounding this cleared
speck on the earth struck me as something great and invincible like
evil or truth waiting patiently for the passing away of this fantastic
invasion

oh these months well never mind various things happened one
evening a grass shed full of calico cotton prints beads and i dont
know what else burst into a blaze so suddenly that you would have
thought the earth had opened to let an avenging fire consume all that
trash i was smoking my pipe quietly by my dismantled steamer and saw
them all cutting capers in the light with their arms lifted high when
the stout man with mustaches came tearing down to the river a tin
pail in his hand assured me that everybody was behaving splendidly
splendidly dipped about a quart of water and tore back again i
noticed there was a hole in the bottom of his pail

i strolled up there was no hurry you see the thing had gone off like
a box of matches it had been hopeless from the very first the flame
had leaped high driven everybody back lighted up everythingand
collapsed the shed was already a heap of embers glowing fiercely a
nigger was being beaten near by they said he had caused the fire in
some way be that as it may he was screeching most horribly i saw him
later on for several days sitting in a bit of shade looking very sick
and trying to recover himself afterwards he arose and went outand
the wilderness without a sound took him into its bosom again as i
approached the glow from the dark i found myself at the back of two men
talking i heard the name of kurtz pronounced then the words take
advantage of this unfortunate accident one of the men was the manager
i wished him a good evening did you ever see anything like iteh it
is incredible he said and walked off the other man remained he was
a firstclass agent young gentlemanly a bit reserved with a forked
little beard and a hooked nose he was standoffish with the other
agents and they on their side said he was the managers spy upon them
as to me i had hardly ever spoken to him before we got into talk and
byandby we strolled away from the hissing ruins then he asked me to
his room which was in the main building of the station he struck
a match and i perceived that this young aristocrat had not only a
silvermounted dressingcase but also a whole candle all to himself
just at that time the manager was the only man supposed to have any
right to candles native mats covered the clay walls a collection of
spears assegais shields knives was hung up in trophies the business
intrusted to this fellow was the making of bricksso i had been
informed but there wasnt a fragment of a brick anywhere in the
station and he had been there more than a yearwaiting it seems he
could not make bricks without something i dont know whatstraw maybe
anyways it could not be found there and as it was not likely to be
sent from europe it did not appear clear to me what he was waiting for
an act of special creation perhaps however they were all waitingall
the sixteen or twenty pilgrims of themfor something and upon my word
it did not seem an uncongenial occupation from the way they took it
though the only thing that ever came to them was diseaseas far as i
could see they beguiled the time by backbiting and intriguing against
each other in a foolish kind of way there was an air of plotting about
that station but nothing came of it of course it was as unreal as
everything elseas the philanthropic pretense of the whole concern as
their talk as their government as their show of work the only real
feeling was a desire to get appointed to a tradingpost where ivory
was to be had so that they could earn percentages they intrigued
and slandered and hated each other only on that accountbut as to
effectually lifting a little fingeroh no by heavens there is
something after all in the world allowing one man to steal a horse while
another must not look at a halter steal a horse straight out very
well he has done it perhaps he can ride but there is a way of looking
at a halter that would provoke the most charitable of saints into a
kick

i had no idea why he wanted to be sociable but as we chatted in there
it suddenly occurred to me the fellow was trying to get at somethingin
fact pumping me he alluded constantly to europe to the people i was
supposed to know thereputting leading questions as to my acquaintances
in the sepulchral city and so on his little eyes glittered like
mica discswith curiositythough he tried to keep up a bit of
superciliousness at first i was astonished but very soon i became
awfully curious to see what he would find out from me i couldnt
possibly imagine what i had in me to make it worth his while it was
very pretty to see how he baffled himself for in truth my body was full
of chills and my head had nothing in it but that wretched steamboat
business it was evident he took me for a perfectly shameless
prevaricator at last he got angry and to conceal a movement of furious
annoyance he yawned i rose then i noticed a small sketch in oils
on a panel representing a woman draped and blindfolded carrying a
lighted torch the background was somberalmost black the movement of
the woman was stately and the effect of the torchlight on the face was
sinister

it arrested me and he stood by civilly holding a halfpint champagne
bottle medical comforts with the candle stuck in it to my question he
said mr kurtz had painted thisin this very station more than a year
agowhile waiting for means to go to his tradingpost tell me pray
said i who is this mr kurtz

the chief of the inner station he answered in a short tone looking
away much obliged i said laughing and you are the brickmaker of
the central station everyone knows that he was silent for a while
he is a prodigy he said at last he is an emissary of pity and
science and progress and devil knows what else we want he began
to declaim suddenly for the guidance of the cause intrusted to us by
europe so to speak higher intelligence wide sympathies a singleness
of purpose who says that i asked lots of them he replied some
even write that and so he comes here a special being as you ought
to know why ought i to know i interrupted really surprised he
paid no attention yes today he is chief of the best station next
year he will be assistantmanager two years more and    but i dare
say you know what he will be in two years time you are of the new
gangthe gang of virtue the same people who sent him specially also
recommended you oh dont say no ive my own eyes to trust light
dawned upon me my dear aunts influential acquaintances were producing
an unexpected effect upon that young man i nearly burst into a laugh
do you read the companys confidential correspondence i asked he
hadnt a word to say it was great fun when mr kurtz i continued
severely is general manager you wont have the opportunity

he blew the candle out suddenly and we went outside the moon had
risen black figures strolled about listlessly pouring water on
the glow whence proceeded a sound of hissing steam ascended in the
moonlight the beaten nigger groaned somewhere what a row the brute
makes said the indefatigable man with the mustaches appearing
near us serve him right transgressionpunishmentbang pitiless
pitiless thats the only way this will prevent all conflagrations
for the future i was just telling the manager    he noticed my
companion and became crestfallen all at once not in bed yet
he said with a kind of servile heartiness its so natural ha
dangeragitation he vanished i went on to the riverside and
the other followed me i heard a scathing murmur at my ear heap
of muffsgo to the pilgrims could be seen in knots gesticulating
discussing several had still their staves in their hands i verily
believe they took these sticks to bed with them beyond the fence the
forest stood up spectrally in the moonlight and through the dim stir
through the faint sounds of that lamentable courtyard the silence of
the land went home to ones very heartits mystery its greatness
the amazing reality of its concealed life the hurt nigger moaned feebly
somewhere near by and then fetched a deep sigh that made me mend my
pace away from there i felt a hand introducing itself under my arm
my dear sir said the fellow i dont want to be misunderstood and
especially by you who will see mr kurtz long before i can have that
pleasure i wouldnt like him to get a false idea of my
disposition


i let him run on this papiermache mephistopheles and it seemed to
me that if i tried i could poke my forefinger through him and would find
nothing inside but a little loose dirt maybe he dont you see had
been planning to be assistantmanager byandby under the present man
and i could see that the coming of that kurtz had upset them both not a
little he talked precipitately and i did not try to stop him i had my
shoulders against the wreck of my steamer hauled up on the slope like a
carcass of some big river animal the smell of mud of primeval mud
by jove was in my nostrils the high stillness of primeval forest was
before my eyes there were shiny patches on the black creek the moon
had spread over everything a thin layer of silverover the rank grass
over the mud upon the wall of matted vegetation standing higher than
the wall of a temple over the great river i could see through a somber
gap glittering glittering as it flowed broadly by without a murmur
all this was great expectant mute while the man jabbered about
himself i wondered whether the stillness on the face of the immensity
looking at us two were meant as an appeal or as a menace what were we
who had strayed in here could we handle that dumb thing or would it
handle us i felt how big how confoundedly big was that thing that
couldnt talk and perhaps was deaf as well what was in there i could
see a little ivory coming out from there and i had heard mr kurtz was
in there i had heard enough about it toogod knows yet somehow it
didnt bring any image with itno more than if i had been told an angel
or a fiend was in there i believed it in the same way one of you might
believe there are inhabitants in the planet mars i knew once a scotch
sailmaker who was certain dead sure there were people in mars if you
asked him for some idea how they looked and behaved he would get shy
and mutter something about walking on allfours if you as much as
smiled he wouldthough a man of sixtyoffer to fight you i would not
have gone so far as to fight for kurtz but i went for him near enough
to a lie you know i hate detest and cant bear a lie not because
i am straighter than the rest of us but simply because it appalls me
there is a taint of death a flavor of mortality in lieswhich is
exactly what i hate and detest in the worldwhat i want to forget
it makes me miserable and sick like biting something rotten would do
temperament i suppose well i went near enough to it by letting the
young fool there believe anything he liked to imagine as to my influence
in europe i became in an instant as much of a pretense as the rest of
the bewitched pilgrims this simply because i had a notion it somehow
would be of help to that kurtz whom at the time i did not seeyou
understand he was just a word for me i did not see the man in the name
any more than you do do you see him do you see the story do you see
anything it seems to me i am trying to tell you a dreammaking a vain
attempt because no relation of a dream can convey the dreamsensation
that commingling of absurdity surprise and bewilderment in a tremor of
struggling revolt that notion of being captured by the incredible which
is of the very essence of dreams

he was silent for a while

   no it is impossible it is impossible to convey the
lifesensation of any given epoch of ones existencethat which
makes its truth its meaningits subtle and penetrating essence it is
impossible we live as we dreamalone

he paused again as if reflecting then addedof course in this you
fellows see more than i could then you see me whom you know

it had become so pitch dark that we listeners could hardly see one
another for a long time already he sitting apart had been no more
to us than a voice there was not a word from anybody the others might
have been asleep but i was awake i listened i listened on the watch
for the sentence for the word that would give me the clew to the
faint uneasiness inspired by this narrative that seemed to shape itself
without human lips in the heavy nightair of the river

   yesi let him run on marlow began again and think what
he pleased about the powers that were behind me i did and there was
nothing behind me there was nothing but that wretched old mangled
steamboat i was leaning against while he talked fluently about the
necessity for every man to get on and when one comes out here you
conceive it is not to gaze at the moon mr kurtz was a universal
genius but even a genius would find it easier to work with adequate
toolsintelligent men he did not make brickswhy there was a
physical impossibility in the wayas i was well aware and if he
did secretarial work for the manager it was because no sensible man
rejects wantonly the confidence of his superiors did i see it i saw
it what more did i want what i really wanted was rivets by heaven
rivets to get on with the workto stop the hole rivets i
wanted there were cases of them down at the coastcasespiled
upburstsplit you kicked a loose rivet at every second step in that
station yard on the hillside rivets had rolled into the grove of death
you could fill your pockets with rivets for the trouble of stooping
downand there wasnt one rivet to be found where it was wanted we had
plates that would do but nothing to fasten them with and every week
the messenger a lone negro letterbag on shoulder and staff in hand
left our station for the coast and several times a week a coast caravan
came in with trade goodsghastly glazed calico that made you shudder
only to look at it glass beads value about a penny a quart confounded
spotted cotton handkerchiefs and no rivets three carriers could have
brought all that was wanted to set that steamboat afloat

he was becoming confidential now but i fancy my unresponsive attitude
must have exasperated him at last for he judged it necessary to inform
me he feared neither god nor devil let alone any mere man i said i
could see that very well but what i wanted was a certain quantity of
rivetsand rivets were what really mr kurtz wanted if he had only
known it now letters went to the coast every week    my dear
sir he cried i write from dictation i demanded rivets there was
a wayfor an intelligent man he changed his manner became very
cold and suddenly began to talk about a hippopotamus wondered whether
sleeping on board the steamer i stuck to my salvage night and day
i wasnt disturbed there was an old hippo that had the bad habit of
getting out on the bank and roaming at night over the station grounds
the pilgrims used to turn out in a body and empty every rifle they could
lay hands on at him some even had sat up o nights for him all this
energy was wasted though that animal has a charmed life he said
but you can say this only of brutes in this country no manyou
apprehend meno man here bears a charmed life he stood there for
a moment in the moonlight with his delicate hooked nose set a little
askew and his mica eyes glittering without a wink then with a curt
good night he strode off i could see he was disturbed and considerably
puzzled which made me feel more hopeful than i had been for days it
was a great comfort to turn from that chap to my influential friend the
battered twisted ruined tinpot steamboat i clambered on board she
rang under my feet like an empty huntley  palmer biscuittin kicked
along a gutter she was nothing so solid in make and rather less pretty
in shape but i had expended enough hard work on her to make me love
her no influential friend would have served me better she had given
me a chance to come out a bitto find out what i could do no i dont
like work i had rather laze about and think of all the fine things that
can be done i dont like workno man doesbut i like what is in the
workthe chance to find yourself your own realityfor yourself not
for otherswhat no other man can ever know they can only see the mere
show and never can tell what it really means

i was not surprised to see somebody sitting aft on the deck with
his legs dangling over the mud you see i rather chummed with the few
mechanics there were in that station whom the other pilgrims naturally
despisedon account of their imperfect manners i suppose this was the
foremana boilermaker by tradea good worker he was a lank bony
yellowfaced man with big intense eyes his aspect was worried and his
head was as bald as the palm of my hand but his hair in falling seemed
to have stuck to his chin and had prospered in the new locality
for his beard hung down to his waist he was a widower with six young
children he had left them in charge of a sister of his to come out
there and the passion of his life was pigeonflying he was an
enthusiast and a connoisseur he would rave about pigeons after work
hours he used sometimes to come over from his hut for a talk about his
children and his pigeons at work when he had to crawl in the mud under
the bottom of the steamboat he would tie up that beard of his in a kind
of white serviette he brought for the purpose it had loops to go over
his ears in the evening he could be seen squatted on the bank rinsing
that wrapper in the creek with great care then spreading it solemnly on
a bush to dry

i slapped him on the back and shouted we shall have rivets he
scrambled to his feet exclaiming no rivets as though he couldnt
believe his ears then in a low voice you    eh i dont know why
we behaved like lunatics i put my finger to the side of my nose and
nodded mysteriously good for you he cried snapped his fingers above
his head lifting one foot i tried a jig we capered on the iron deck
a frightful clatter came out of that hulk and the virgin forest on
the other bank of the creek sent it back in a thundering roll upon the
sleeping station it must have made some of the pilgrims sit up in their
hovels a dark figure obscured the lighted doorway of the managers hut
vanished then a second or so after the doorway itself vanished too
we stopped and the silence driven away by the stamping of our feet
flowed back again from the recesses of the land the great wall of
vegetation an exuberant and entangled mass of trunks branches leaves
boughs festoons motionless in the moonlight was like a rioting
invasion of soundless life a rolling wave of plants piled up crested
ready to topple over the creek to sweep every little man of us out
of his little existence and it moved not a deadened burst of mighty
splashes and snorts reached us from afar as though an ichthyosaurus had
been taking a bath of glitter in the great river after all said the
boilermaker in a reasonable tone why shouldnt we get the rivets
why not indeed i did not know of any reason why we shouldnt theyll
come in three weeks i said confidently

but they didnt instead of rivets there came an invasion an
infliction a visitation it came in sections during the next three
weeks each section headed by a donkey carrying a white man in new
clothes and tan shoes bowing from that elevation right and left to the
impressed pilgrims a quarrelsome band of footsore sulky niggers trod on
the heels of the donkeys a lot of tents campstools tin boxes white
cases brown bales would be shot down in the courtyard and the air of
mystery would deepen a little over the muddle of the station five such
installments came with their absurd air of disorderly flight with the
loot of innumerable outfit shops and provision stores that one
would think they were lugging after a raid into the wilderness for
equitable division it was an inextricable mess of things decent in
themselves but that human folly made look like the spoils of thieving

this devoted band called itself the eldorado exploring expedition and
i believe they were sworn to secrecy their talk however was the talk
of sordid buccaneers it was reckless without hardihood greedy without
audacity and cruel without courage there was not an atom of foresight
or of serious intention in the whole batch of them and they did not
seem aware these things are wanted for the work of the world to tear
treasure out of the bowels of the land was their desire with no more
moral purpose at the back of it than there is in burglars breaking into
a safe who paid the expenses of the noble enterprise i dont know but
the uncle of our manager was leader of that lot

in exterior he resembled a butcher in a poor neighborhood and his eyes
had a look of sleepy cunning he carried his fat paunch with ostentation
on his short legs and during the time his gang infested the station
spoke to no one but his nephew you could see these two roaming about
all day long with their heads close together in an everlasting confab

i had given up worrying myself about the rivets ones capacity for
that kind of folly is more limited than you would suppose i said
hangand let things slide i had plenty of time for meditation
and now and then i would give some thought to kurtz i wasnt very
interested in him no still i was curious to see whether this man who
had come out equipped with moral ideas of some sort would climb to the
top after all and how he would set about his work when there


ii


one evening as i was lying flat on the deck of my steamboat i heard
voices approachingand there were the nephew and the uncle strolling
along the bank i laid my head on my arm again and had nearly lost
myself in a doze when somebody said in my ear as it were i am as
harmless as a little child but i dont like to be dictated to am i the
manageror am i not i was ordered to send him there its incredible
   i became aware that the two were standing on the shore alongside
the forepart of the steamboat just below my head i did not move it
did not occur to me to move i was sleepy it is unpleasant grunted
the uncle he has asked the administration to be sent there said the
other with the idea of showing what he could do and i was instructed
accordingly look at the influence that man must have is it not
frightful they both agreed it was frightful then made several bizarre
remarks make rain and fine weatherone manthe councilby the
nosebits of absurd sentences that got the better of my drowsiness
so that i had pretty near the whole of my wits about me when the uncle
said the climate may do away with this difficulty for you is he alone
there yes answered the manager he sent his assistant down the
river with a note to me in these terms clear this poor devil out of
the country and dont bother sending more of that sort i had rather be
alone than have the kind of men you can dispose of with me it was more
than a year ago can you imagine such impudence anything since
then asked the other hoarsely ivory jerked the nephew lots
of itprime sortlotsmost annoying from him and with that
questioned the heavy rumble invoice was the reply fired out so to
speak then silence they had been talking about kurtz

i was broad awake by this time but lying perfectly at ease remained
still having no inducement to change my position how did that ivory
come all this way growled the elder man who seemed very vexed the
other explained that it had come with a fleet of canoes in charge of an
english halfcaste clerk kurtz had with him that kurtz had apparently
intended to return himself the station being by that time bare of goods
and stores but after coming three hundred miles had suddenly decided
to go back which he started to do alone in a small dugout with four
paddlers leaving the halfcaste to continue down the river with the
ivory the two fellows there seemed astounded at anybody attempting such
a thing they were at a loss for an adequate motive as to me i seemed
to see kurtz for the first time it was a distinct glimpse the dugout
four paddling savages and the lone white man turning his back suddenly
on the headquarters on relief on thoughts of homeperhaps setting
his face towards the depths of the wilderness towards his empty and
desolate station i did not know the motive perhaps he was just simply
a fine fellow who stuck to his work for its own sake his name you
understand had not been pronounced once he was that man the
halfcaste who as far as i could see had conducted a difficult
trip with great prudence and pluck was invariably alluded to as that
scoundrel the scoundrel had reported that the man had been very
illhad recovered imperfectly    the two below me moved away then a
few paces and strolled back and forth at some little distance i heard
military postdoctortwo hundred milesquite alone nowunavoidable
delaysnine monthsno newsstrange rumors they approached again
just as the manager was saying no one as far as i know unless a
species of wandering tradera pestilential fellow snapping ivory from
the natives who was it they were talking about now i gathered in
snatches that this was some man supposed to be in kurtzs district and
of whom the manager did not approve we will not be free from unfair
competition till one of these fellows is hanged for an example
he said certainly grunted the other get him hanged why not
anythinganything can be done in this country thats what i say
nobody here you understand here can endanger your position and
why you stand the climateyou outlast them all the danger is in
europe but there before i left i took care to they moved off and
whispered then their voices rose again the extraordinary series of
delays is not my fault i did my possible the fat man sighed very
sad and the pestiferous absurdity of his talk continued the other
he bothered me enough when he was here each station should be like a
beacon on the road towards better things a center for trade of course
but also for humanizing improving instructing conceive youthat
ass and he wants to be manager no its here he got choked by
excessive indignation and i lifted my head the least bit i was
surprised to see how near they wereright under me i could have spat
upon their hats they were looking on the ground absorbed in thought
the manager was switching his leg with a slender twig his sagacious
relative lifted his head you have been well since you came out this
time he asked the other gave a start who i oh like a charmlike
a charm but the restoh my goodness all sick they die so quick
too that i havent the time to send them out of the countryits
incredible hm just so grunted the uncle ah my boy trust to
thisi say trust to this i saw him extend his short flipper of
an arm for a gesture that took in the forest the creek the mud the
riverseemed to beckon with a dishonoring flourish before the sunlit
face of the land a treacherous appeal to the lurking death to the
hidden evil to the profound darkness of its heart it was so startling
that i leaped to my feet and looked back at the edge of the forest as
though i had expected an answer of some sort to that black display of
confidence you know the foolish notions that come to one sometimes the
high stillness confronted these two figures with its ominous patience
waiting for the passing away of a fantastic invasion

they swore aloud togetherout of sheer fright i believethen
pretending not to know anything of my existence turned back to the
station the sun was low and leaning forward side by side they seemed
to be tugging painfully uphill their two ridiculous shadows of unequal
length that trailed behind them slowly over the tall grass without
bending a single blade

in a few days the eldorado expedition went into the patient wilderness
that closed upon it as the sea closes over a diver long afterwards the
news came that all the donkeys were dead i know nothing as to the fate
of the less valuable animals they no doubt like the rest of us found
what they deserved i did not inquire i was then rather excited at
the prospect of meeting kurtz very soon when i say very soon i mean
it comparatively it was just two months from the day we left the creek
when we came to the bank below kurtzs station

going up that river was like traveling back to the earliest beginnings
of the world when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were
kings an empty stream a great silence an impenetrable forest the air
was warm thick heavy sluggish there was no joy in the brilliance of
sunshine the long stretches of the waterway ran on deserted into
the gloom of overshadowed distances on silvery sandbanks hippos and
alligators sunned themselves side by side the broadening waters flowed
through a mob of wooded islands you lost your way on that river as you
would in a desert and butted all day long against shoals trying to
find the channel till you thought yourself bewitched and cut off for
ever from everything you had known oncesomewherefar awayin another
existence perhaps there were moments when ones past came back to one
as it will sometimes when you have not a moment to spare to yourself
but it came in the shape of an unrestful and noisy dream remembered
with wonder amongst the overwhelming realities of this strange world of
plants and water and silence and this stillness of life did not in
the least resemble a peace it was the stillness of an implacable force
brooding over an inscrutable intention it looked at you with a vengeful
aspect i got used to it afterwards i did not see it any more i had no
time i had to keep guessing at the channel i had to discern mostly by
inspiration the signs of hidden banks i watched for sunken stones i
was learning to clap my teeth smartly before my heart flew out when i
shaved by a fluke some infernal sly old snag that would have ripped the
life out of the tinpot steamboat and drowned all the pilgrims i had to
keep a lookout for the signs of dead wood we could cut up in the night
for next days steaming when you have to attend to things of that sort
to the mere incidents of the surface the realitythe reality i tell
youfades the inner truth is hiddenluckily luckily but i felt it
all the same i felt often its mysterious stillness watching me at
my monkey tricks just as it watches you fellows performing on your
respective tightropes forwhat is it halfacrown a tumble

try to be civil marlow growled a voice and i knew there was at
least one listener awake besides myself

i beg your pardon i forgot the heartache which makes up the rest of
the price and indeed what does the price matter if the trick be well
done you do your tricks very well and i didnt do badly either since
i managed not to sink that steamboat on my first trip its a wonder to
me yet imagine a blindfolded man set to drive a van over a bad road
i sweated and shivered over that business considerably i can tell
you after all for a seaman to scrape the bottom of the thing thats
supposed to float all the time under his care is the unpardonable sin
no one may know of it but you never forget the thumpeh a blow on the
very heart you remember it you dream of it you wake up at night and
think of ityears afterand go hot and cold all over i dont pretend
to say that steamboat floated all the time more than once she had to
wade for a bit with twenty cannibals splashing around and pushing
we had enlisted some of these chaps on the way for a crew fine
fellowscannibalsin their place they were men one could work with
and i am grateful to them and after all they did not eat each other
before my face they had brought along a provision of hippomeat
which went rotten and made the mystery of the wilderness stink in my
nostrils phoo i can sniff it now i had the manager on board and three
or four pilgrims with their stavesall complete sometimes we came upon
a station close by the bank clinging to the skirts of the unknown and
the white men rushing out of a tumbledown hovel with great gestures of
joy and surprise and welcome seemed very strangehad the appearance
of being held there captive by a spell the word ivory would ring in
the air for a whileand on we went again into the silence along empty
reaches round the still bends between the high walls of our
winding way reverberating in hollow claps the ponderous beat of the
sternwheel trees trees millions of trees massive immense running
up high and at their foot hugging the bank against the stream crept
the little begrimed steamboat like a sluggish beetle crawling on the
floor of a lofty portico it made you feel very small very lost and
yet it was not altogether depressing that feeling after all if you
were small the grimy beetle crawled onwhich was just what you wanted
it to do where the pilgrims imagined it crawled to i dont know
to some place where they expected to get something i bet for me it
crawled toward kurtzexclusively but when the steampipes started
leaking we crawled very slow the reaches opened before us and closed
behind as if the forest had stepped leisurely across the water to bar
the way for our return we penetrated deeper and deeper into the heart
of darkness it was very quiet there at night sometimes the roll of
drums behind the curtain of trees would run up the river and remain
sustained faintly as if hovering in the air high over our heads till
the first break of day whether it meant war peace or prayer we could
not tell the dawns were heralded by the descent of a chill stillness
the woodcutters slept their fires burned low the snapping of a twig
would make you start we were wanderers on a prehistoric earth on an
earth that wore the aspect of an unknown planet we could have fancied
ourselves the first of men taking possession of an accursed inheritance
to be subdued at the cost of profound anguish and of excessive toil but
suddenly as we struggled round a bend there would be a glimpse of rush
walls of peaked grassroofs a burst of yells a whirl of black limbs
a mass of hands clapping of feet stamping of bodies swaying of eyes
rolling under the droop of heavy and motionless foliage the steamer
toiled along slowly on the edge of a black and incomprehensible frenzy
the prehistoric man was cursing us praying to us welcoming uswho
could tell we were cut off from the comprehension of our surroundings
we glided past like phantoms wondering and secretly appalled as sane
men would be before an enthusiastic outbreak in a madhouse we could not
understand because we were too far and could not remember because we
were traveling in the night of first ages of those ages that are gone
leaving hardly a signand no memories

the earth seemed unearthly we are accustomed to look upon the shackled
form of a conquered monster but therethere you could look at a thing
monstrous and free it was unearthly and the men wereno they were
not inhuman well you know that was the worst of itthis suspicion of
their not being inhuman it would come slowly to one they howled and
leaped and spun and made horrid faces but what thrilled you was just
the thought of their humanitylike yoursthe thought of your remote
kinship with this wild and passionate uproar ugly yes it was ugly
enough but if you were man enough you would admit to yourself that
there was in you just the faintest trace of a response to the terrible
frankness of that noise a dim suspicion of there being a meaning in it
which youyou so remote from the night of first agescould comprehend
and why not the mind of man is capable of anythingbecause everything
is in it all the past as well as all the future what was there after
all joy fear sorrow devotion valor ragewho can tellbut
truthtruth stripped of its cloak of time let the fool gape and
shudderthe man knows and can look on without a wink but he must at
least be as much of a man as these on the shore he must meet that
truth with his own true stuffwith his own inborn strength principles
principles wont do acquisitions clothes pretty ragsrags that would
fly off at the first good shake no you want a deliberate belief an
appeal to me in this fiendish rowis there very well i hear i admit
but i have a voice too and for good or evil mine is the speech that
cannot be silenced of course a fool what with sheer fright and fine
sentiments is always safe whos that grunting you wonder i didnt go
ashore for a howl and a dance well noi didnt fine sentiments you
say fine sentiments be hanged i had no time i had to mess about with
whitelead and strips of woolen blanket helping to put bandages on
those leaky steampipesi tell you i had to watch the steering and
circumvent those snags and get the tinpot along by hook or by crook
there was surfacetruth enough in these things to save a wiser man and
between whiles i had to look after the savage who was fireman he was
an improved specimen he could fire up a vertical boiler he was there
below me and upon my word to look at him was as edifying as seeing a
dog in a parody of breeches and a feather hat walking on his hindlegs
a few months of training had done for that really fine chap he squinted
at the steamgauge and at the watergauge with an evident effort of
intrepidityand he had filed teeth too the poor devil and the wool of
his pate shaved into queer patterns and three ornamental scars on each
of his cheeks he ought to have been clapping his hands and stamping
his feet on the bank instead of which he was hard at work a thrall to
strange witchcraft full of improving knowledge he was useful because
he had been instructed and what he knew was thisthat should the water
in that transparent thing disappear the evil spirit inside the boiler
would get angry through the greatness of his thirst and take a terrible
vengeance so he sweated and fired up and watched the glass fearfully
with an impromptu charm made of rags tied to his arm and a piece of
polished bone as big as a watch stuck flatways through his lower lip
while the wooded banks slipped past us slowly the short noise was left
behind the interminable miles of silenceand we crept on towards
kurtz but the snags were thick the water was treacherous and shallow
the boiler seemed indeed to have a sulky devil in it and thus neither
that fireman nor i had any time to peer into our creepy thoughts

some fifty miles below the inner station we came upon a hut of reeds
an inclined and melancholy pole with the unrecognizable tatters of
what had been a flag of some sort flying from it and a neatly stacked
woodpile this was unexpected we came to the bank and on the stack of
firewood found a flat piece of board with some faded pencilwriting
on it when deciphered it said wood for you hurry up approach
cautiously there was a signature but it was illegiblenot
kurtza much longer word hurry up where up the river approach
cautiously we had not done so but the warning could not have been
meant for the place where it could be only found after approach
something was wrong above but whatand how much that was the
question we commented adversely upon the imbecility of that telegraphic
style the bush around said nothing and would not let us look very far
either a torn curtain of red twill hung in the doorway of the hut and
flapped sadly in our faces the dwelling was dismantled but we could
see a white man had lived there not very long ago there remained a rude
tablea plank on two posts a heap of rubbish reposed in a dark corner
and by the door i picked up a book it had lost its covers and the
pages had been thumbed into a state of extremely dirty softness but the
back had been lovingly stitched afresh with white cotton thread which
looked clean yet it was an extraordinary find its title was an
inquiry into some points of seamanship by a man tower towsonsome
such namemaster in his majestys navy the matter looked dreary
reading enough with illustrative diagrams and repulsive tables of
figures and the copy was sixty years old i handled this amazing
antiquity with the greatest possible tenderness lest it should dissolve
in my hands within towson or towser was inquiring earnestly into the
breaking strain of ships chains and tackle and other such matters not
a very enthralling book but at the first glance you could see there a
singleness of intention an honest concern for the right way of going
to work which made these humble pages thought out so many years ago
luminous with another than a professional light the simple old sailor
with his talk of chains and purchases made me forget the jungle and
the pilgrims in a delicious sensation of having come upon something
unmistakably real such a book being there was wonderful enough but
still more astounding were the notes penciled in the margin and plainly
referring to the text i couldnt believe my eyes they were in cipher
yes it looked like cipher fancy a man lugging with him a book of that
description into this nowhere and studying itand making notesin
cipher at that it was an extravagant mystery

i had been dimly aware for some time of a worrying noise and when i
lifted my eyes i saw the woodpile was gone and the manager aided by
all the pilgrims was shouting at me from the riverside i slipped the
book into my pocket i assure you to leave off reading was like tearing
myself away from the shelter of an old and solid friendship

i started the lame engine ahead it must be this miserable
traderthis intruder exclaimed the manager looking back malevolently
at the place we had left he must be english i said it will not
save him from getting into trouble if he is not careful muttered the
manager darkly i observed with assumed innocence that no man was safe
from trouble in this world

the current was more rapid now the steamer seemed at her last gasp
the sternwheel flopped languidly and i caught myself listening on
tiptoe for the next beat of the boat for in sober truth i expected the
wretched thing to give up every moment it was like watching the last
flickers of a life but still we crawled sometimes i would pick out a
tree a little way ahead to measure our progress towards kurtz by but
i lost it invariably before we got abreast to keep the eyes so long
on one thing was too much for human patience the manager displayed
a beautiful resignation i fretted and fumed and took to arguing with
myself whether or no i would talk openly with kurtz but before i could
come to any conclusion it occurred to me that my speech or my silence
indeed any action of mine would be a mere futility what did it matter
what anyone knew or ignored what did it matter who was manager one
gets sometimes such a flash of insight the essentials of this affair
lay deep under the surface beyond my reach and beyond my power of
meddling

towards the evening of the second day we judged ourselves about eight
miles from kurtzs station i wanted to push on but the manager looked
grave and told me the navigation up there was so dangerous that it
would be advisable the sun being very low already to wait where we
were till next morning moreover he pointed out that if the warning
to approach cautiously were to be followed we must approach in
daylightnot at dusk or in the dark this was sensible enough eight
miles meant nearly three hours steaming for us and i could also see
suspicious ripples at the upper end of the reach nevertheless i was
annoyed beyond expression at the delay and most unreasonably too since
one night more could not matter much after so many months as we had
plenty of wood and caution was the word i brought up in the middle
of the stream the reach was narrow straight with high sides like a
railway cutting the dusk came gliding into it long before the sun had
set the current ran smooth and swift but a dumb immobility sat on
the banks the living trees lashed together by the creepers and every
living bush of the undergrowth might have been changed into stone
even to the slenderest twig to the lightest leaf it was not sleepit
seemed unnatural like a state of trance not the faintest sound of any
kind could be heard you looked on amazed and began to suspect yourself
of being deafthen the night came suddenly and struck you blind as
well about three in the morning some large fish leaped and the loud
splash made me jump as though a gun had been fired when the sun rose
there was a white fog very warm and clammy and more blinding than the
night it did not shift or drive it was just there standing all round
you like something solid at eight or nine perhaps it lifted as a
shutter lifts we had a glimpse of the towering multitude of trees
of the immense matted jungle with the blazing little ball of the sun
hanging over itall perfectly stilland then the white shutter came
down again smoothly as if sliding in greased grooves i ordered the
chain which we had begun to heave in to be paid out again before it
stopped running with a muffled rattle a cry a very loud cry as of
infinite desolation soared slowly in the opaque air it ceased a
complaining clamor modulated in savage discords filled our ears the
sheer unexpectedness of it made my hair stir under my cap i dont know
how it struck the others to me it seemed as though the mist itself had
screamed so suddenly and apparently from all sides at once did
this tumultuous and mournful uproar arise it culminated in a hurried
outbreak of almost intolerably excessive shrieking which stopped short
leaving us stiffened in a variety of silly attitudes and obstinately
listening to the nearly as appalling and excessive silence good god
what is the meaning stammered at my elbow one of the pilgrimsa
little fat man with sandy hair and red whiskers who wore sidespring
boots and pink pyjamas tucked into his socks two others remained
openmouthed a whole minute then dashed into the little cabin to rush
out incontinently and stand darting scared glances with winchesters at
ready in their hands what we could see was just the steamer we
were on her outlines blurred as though she had been on the point of
dissolving and a misty strip of water perhaps two feet broad around
herand that was all the rest of the world was nowhere as far as our
eyes and ears were concerned just nowhere gone disappeared swept off
without leaving a whisper or a shadow behind

i went forward and ordered the chain to be hauled in short so as to
be ready to trip the anchor and move the steamboat at once if necessary
will they attack whispered an awed voice we will all be butchered
in this fog murmured another the faces twitched with the strain the
hands trembled slightly the eyes forgot to wink it was very curious
to see the contrast of expressions of the white men and of the black
fellows of our crew who were as much strangers to that part of the
river as we though their homes were only eight hundred miles away the
whites of course greatly discomposed had besides a curious look of
being painfully shocked by such an outrageous row the others had an
alert naturally interested expression but their faces were essentially
quiet even those of the one or two who grinned as they hauled at the
chain several exchanged short grunting phrases which seemed to settle
the matter to their satisfaction their headman a young broadchested
black severely draped in darkblue fringed cloths with fierce nostrils
and his hair all done up artfully in oily ringlets stood near me
aha i said just for good fellowships sake catch im he snapped
with a bloodshot widening of his eyes and a flash of sharp teethcatch
im give im to us to you eh i asked what would you do with
them eat im he said curtly and leaning his elbow on the rail
looked out into the fog in a dignified and profoundly pensive attitude
i would no doubt have been properly horrified had it not occurred to
me that he and his chaps must be very hungry that they must have been
growing increasingly hungry for at least this month past they had been
engaged for six months i dont think a single one of them had any
clear idea of time as we at the end of countless ages have they still
belonged to the beginnings of timehad no inherited experience to teach
them as it were and of course as long as there was a piece of paper
written over in accordance with some farcical law or other made down the
river it didnt enter anybodys head to trouble how they would live
certainly they had brought with them some rotten hippomeat which
couldnt have lasted very long anyway even if the pilgrims hadnt in
the midst of a shocking hullabaloo thrown a considerable quantity of it
overboard it looked like a highhanded proceeding but it was really
a case of legitimate selfdefense you cant breathe dead hippo waking
sleeping and eating and at the same time keep your precarious grip on
existence besides that they had given them every week three pieces of
brass wire each about nine inches long and the theory was they were to
buy their provisions with that currency in riverside villages you can
see how that worked there were either no villages or the people were
hostile or the director who like the rest of us fed out of tins with
an occasional old hegoat thrown in didnt want to stop the steamer for
some more or less recondite reason so unless they swallowed the wire
itself or made loops of it to snare the fishes with i dont see what
good their extravagant salary could be to them i must say it was paid
with a regularity worthy of a large and honorable trading company for
the rest the only thing to eatthough it didnt look eatable in the
leasti saw in their possession was a few lumps of some stuff like
halfcooked dough of a dirty lavender color they kept wrapped in
leaves and now and then swallowed a piece of but so small that it
seemed done more for the looks of the thing than for any serious purpose
of sustenance why in the name of all the gnawing devils of hunger they
didnt go for usthey were thirty to fiveand have a good tuck in for
once amazes me now when i think of it they were big powerful men
with not much capacity to weigh the consequences with courage with
strength even yet though their skins were no longer glossy and their
muscles no longer hard and i saw that something restraining one of
those human secrets that baffle probability had come into play there
i looked at them with a swift quickening of interestnot because it
occurred to me i might be eaten by them before very long though i
own to you that just then i perceivedin a new light as it werehow
unwholesome the pilgrims looked and i hoped yes i positively hoped
that my aspect was not sowhat shall i saysounappetizing a touch
of fantastic vanity which fitted well with the dreamsensation that
pervaded all my days at that time perhaps i had a little fever too one
cant live with ones finger everlastingly on ones pulse i had
often a little fever or a little touch of other thingsthe playful
pawstrokes of the wilderness the preliminary trifling before the more
serious onslaught which came in due course yes i looked at them as you
would on any human being with a curiosity of their impulses motives
capacities weaknesses when brought to the test of an inexorable
physical necessity restraint what possible restraint was it
superstition disgust patience fearor some kind of primitive honor
no fear can stand up to hunger no patience can wear it out disgust
simply does not exist where hunger is and as to superstition beliefs
and what you may call principles they are less than chaff in a breeze
dont you know the devilry of lingering starvation its exasperating
torment its black thoughts its somber and brooding ferocity well
i do it takes a man all his inborn strength to fight hunger properly
its really easier to face bereavement dishonor and the perdition of
ones soulthan this kind of prolonged hunger sad but true and these
chaps too had no earthly reason for any kind of scruple restraint i
would just as soon have expected restraint from a hyena prowling amongst
the corpses of a battlefield but there was the fact facing methe fact
dazzling to be seen like the foam on the depths of the sea like a
ripple on an unfathomable enigma a mystery greaterwhen i thought
of itthan the curious inexplicable note of desperate grief in this
savage clamor that had swept by us on the riverbank behind the blind
whiteness of the fog

two pilgrims were quarreling in hurried whispers as to which bank
left no no how can you right right of course it is very
serious said the managers voice behind me i would be desolated if
anything should happen to mr kurtz before we came up i looked at him
and had not the slightest doubt he was sincere he was just the kind of
man who would wish to preserve appearances that was his restraint but
when he muttered something about going on at once i did not even take
the trouble to answer him i knew and he knew that it was impossible
were we to let go our hold of the bottom we would be absolutely in
the airin space we wouldnt be able to tell where we were going
towhether up or down stream or acrosstill we fetched against one
bank or the otherand then we wouldnt know at first which it was
of course i made no move i had no mind for a smashup you couldnt
imagine a more deadly place for a shipwreck whether drowned at once or
not we were sure to perish speedily in one way or another i authorize
you to take all the risks he said after a short silence i refuse to
take any i said shortly which was just the answer he expected though
its tone might have surprised him well i must defer to your judgment
you are captain he said with marked civility i turned my shoulder to
him in sign of my appreciation and looked into the fog how long would
it last it was the most hopeless lookout the approach to this kurtz
grubbing for ivory in the wretched bush was beset by as many dangers as
though he had been an enchanted princess sleeping in a fabulous castle
will they attack do you think asked the manager in a confidential
tone

i did not think they would attack for several obvious reasons the
thick fog was one if they left the bank in their canoes they would get
lost in it as we would be if we attempted to move still i had also
judged the jungle of both banks quite impenetrableand yet eyes were
in it eyes that had seen us the riverside bushes were certainly very
thick but the undergrowth behind was evidently penetrable
however during the short lift i had seen no canoes anywhere in the
reachcertainly not abreast of the steamer but what made the idea of
attack inconceivable to me was the nature of the noiseof the cries we
had heard they had not the fierce character boding of immediate hostile
intention unexpected wild and violent as they had been they had
given me an irresistible impression of sorrow the glimpse of the
steamboat had for some reason filled those savages with unrestrained
grief the danger if any i expounded was from our proximity to a
great human passion let loose even extreme grief may ultimately vent
itself in violencebut more generally takes the form of apathy

you should have seen the pilgrims stare they had no heart to grin or
even to revile me but i believe they thought me gone madwith fright
maybe i delivered a regular lecture my dear boys it was no good
bothering keep a lookout well you may guess i watched the fog for
the signs of lifting as a cat watches a mouse but for anything else our
eyes were of no more use to us than if we had been buried miles deep
in a heap of cottonwool it felt like it toochoking warm stifling
besides all i said though it sounded extravagant was absolutely
true to fact what we afterwards alluded to as an attack was really an
attempt at repulse the action was very far from being aggressiveit
was not even defensive in the usual sense it was undertaken under the
stress of desperation and in its essence was purely protective

it developed itself i should say two hours after the fog lifted and
its commencement was at a spot roughly speaking about a mile and a
half below kurtzs station we had just floundered and flopped round a
bend when i saw an islet a mere grassy hummock of bright green in
the middle of the stream it was the only thing of the kind but as we
opened the reach more i perceived it was the head of a long sandbank
or rather of a chain of shallow patches stretching down the middle of
the river they were discolored just awash and the whole lot was seen
just under the water exactly as a mans backbone is seen running down
the middle of his back under the skin now as far as i did see i could
go to the right or to the left of this i didnt know either channel of
course the banks looked pretty well alike the depth appeared the same
but as i had been informed the station was on the west side i naturally
headed for the western passage

no sooner had we fairly entered it than i became aware it was much
narrower than i had supposed to the left of us there was the long
uninterrupted shoal and to the right a high steep bank heavily
overgrown with bushes above the bush the trees stood in serried ranks
the twigs overhung the current thickly and from distance to distance a
large limb of some tree projected rigidly over the stream it was then
well on in the afternoon the face of the forest was gloomy and a
broad strip of shadow had already fallen on the water in this shadow
we steamed upvery slowly as you may imagine i sheered her well
inshorethe water being deepest near the bank as the soundingpole
informed me

one of my hungry and forbearing friends was sounding in the bows just
below me this steamboat was exactly like a decked scow on the deck
there were two little teakwood houses with doors and windows the
boiler was in the foreend and the machinery right astern over the
whole there was a light roof supported on stanchions the funnel
projected through that roof and in front of the funnel a small cabin
built of light planks served for a pilothouse it contained a couch
two campstools a loaded martinihenry leaning in one corner a tiny
table and the steeringwheel it had a wide door in front and a broad
shutter at each side all these were always thrown open of course i
spent my days perched up there on the extreme foreend of that roof
before the door at night i slept or tried to on the couch an
athletic black belonging to some coast tribe and educated by my poor
predecessor was the helmsman he sported a pair of brass earrings wore
a blue cloth wrapper from the waist to the ankles and thought all the
world of himself he was the most unstable kind of fool i had ever seen
he steered with no end of a swagger while you were by but if he lost
sight of you he became instantly the prey of an abject funk and would
let that cripple of a steamboat get the upper hand of him in a minute

i was looking down at the soundingpole and feeling much annoyed to
see at each try a little more of it stick out of that river when i saw
my poleman give up the business suddenly and stretch himself flat on
the deck without even taking the trouble to haul his pole in he kept
hold on it though and it trailed in the water at the same time the
fireman whom i could also see below me sat down abruptly before his
furnace and ducked his head i was amazed then i had to look at the
river mighty quick because there was a snag in the fairway sticks
little sticks were flying aboutthick they were whizzing before my
nose dropping below me striking behind me against my pilothouse all
this time the river the shore the woods were very quietperfectly
quiet i could only hear the heavy splashing thump of the sternwheel
and the patter of these things we cleared the snag clumsily arrows by
jove we were being shot at i stepped in quickly to close the shutter
on the land side that foolhelmsman his hands on the spokes was
lifting his knees high stamping his feet champing his mouth like a
reinedin horse confound him and we were staggering within ten feet of
the bank i had to lean right out to swing the heavy shutter and i saw
a face amongst the leaves on the level with my own looking at me very
fierce and steady and then suddenly as though a veil had been removed
from my eyes i made out deep in the tangled gloom naked breasts
arms legs glaring eyesthe bush was swarming with human limbs in
movement glistening of bronze color the twigs shook swayed and
rustled the arrows flew out of them and then the shutter came to
steer her straight i said to the helmsman he held his head rigid
face forward but his eyes rolled he kept on lifting and setting down
his feet gently his mouth foamed a little keep quiet i said in a
fury i might just as well have ordered a tree not to sway in the wind
i darted out below me there was a great scuffle of feet on the iron
deck confused exclamations a voice screamed can you turn back
i caught shape of a vshaped ripple on the water ahead what another
snag a fusillade burst out under my feet the pilgrims had opened with
their winchesters and were simply squirting lead into that bush a
deuce of a lot of smoke came up and drove slowly forward i swore at
it now i couldnt see the ripple or the snag either i stood in the
doorway peering and the arrows came in swarms they might have been
poisoned but they looked as though they wouldnt kill a cat the bush
began to howl our woodcutters raised a warlike whoop the report of a
rifle just at my back deafened me i glanced over my shoulder and the
pilothouse was yet full of noise and smoke when i made a dash at the
wheel the foolnigger had dropped everything to throw the shutter
open and let off that martinihenry he stood before the wide opening
glaring and i yelled at him to come back while i straightened the
sudden twist out of that steamboat there was no room to turn even if i
had wanted to the snag was somewhere very near ahead in that confounded
smoke there was no time to lose so i just crowded her into the
bankright into the bank where i knew the water was deep

we tore slowly along the overhanging bushes in a whirl of broken twigs
and flying leaves the fusillade below stopped short as i had foreseen
it would when the squirts got empty i threw my head back to a glinting
whizz that traversed the pilothouse in at one shutterhole and out
at the other looking past that mad helmsman who was shaking the empty
rifle and yelling at the shore i saw vague forms of men running bent
double leaping gliding distinct incomplete evanescent something
big appeared in the air before the shutter the rifle went overboard
and the man stepped back swiftly looked at me over his shoulder in an
extraordinary profound familiar manner and fell upon my feet the
side of his head hit the wheel twice and the end of what appeared
a long cane clattered round and knocked over a little campstool it
looked as though after wrenching that thing from somebody ashore he had
lost his balance in the effort the thin smoke had blown away we were
clear of the snag and looking ahead i could see that in another hundred
yards or so i would be free to sheer off away from the bank but my
feet felt so very warm and wet that i had to look down the man had
rolled on his back and stared straight up at me both his hands clutched
that cane it was the shaft of a spear that either thrown or lunged
through the opening had caught him in the side just below the ribs the
blade had gone in out of sight after making a frightful gash my shoes
were full a pool of blood lay very still gleaming darkred under the
wheel his eyes shone with an amazing luster the fusillade burst out
again he looked at me anxiously gripping the spear like something
precious with an air of being afraid i would try to take it away from
him i had to make an effort to free my eyes from his gaze and attend
to the steering with one hand i felt above my head for the line of
the steamwhistle and jerked out screech after screech hurriedly the
tumult of angry and warlike yells was checked instantly and then from
the depths of the woods went out such a tremulous and prolonged wail of
mournful fear and utter despair as may be imagined to follow the flight
of the last hope from the earth there was a great commotion in the
bush the shower of arrows stopped a few dropping shots rang out
sharplythen silence in which the languid beat of the sternwheel came
plainly to my ears i put the helm hard astarboard at the moment when
the pilgrim in pink pyjamas very hot and agitated appeared in the
doorway the manager sends me he began in an official tone and
stopped short good god he said glaring at the wounded man

we two whites stood over him and his lustrous and inquiring glance
enveloped us both i declare it looked as though he would presently put
to us some question in an understandable language but he died without
uttering a sound without moving a limb without twitching a muscle
only in the very last moment as though in response to some sign we
could not see to some whisper we could not hear he frowned heavily
and that frown gave to his black deathmask an inconceivably somber
brooding and menacing expression the luster of inquiring glance faded
swiftly into vacant glassiness can you steer i asked the agent
eagerly he looked very dubious but i made a grab at his arm and he
understood at once i meant him to steer whether or no to tell you
the truth i was morbidly anxious to change my shoes and socks he is
dead murmured the fellow immensely impressed no doubt about it
said i tugging like mad at the shoelaces and by the way i suppose
mr kurtz is dead as well by this time

for the moment that was the dominant thought there was a sense of
extreme disappointment as though i had found out i had been striving
after something altogether without a substance i couldnt have been
more disgusted if i had traveled all this way for the sole purpose of
talking with mr kurtz talking with    i flung one shoe overboard
and became aware that that was exactly what i had been looking forward
toa talk with kurtz i made the strange discovery that i had never
imagined him as doing you know but as discoursing i didnt say to
myself now i will never see him or now i will never shake him by
the hand but now i will never hear him the man presented himself
as a voice not of course that i did not connect him with some sort of
action hadnt i been told in all the tones of jealousy and admiration
that he had collected bartered swindled or stolen more ivory than all
the other agents together that was not the point the point was in his
being a gifted creature and that of all his gifts the one that stood
out preeminently that carried with it a sense of real presence was
his ability to talk his wordsthe gift of expression the bewildering
the illuminating the most exalted and the most contemptible the
pulsating stream of light or the deceitful flow from the heart of an
impenetrable darkness

the other shoe went flying unto the devilgod of that river i thought
by jove its all over we are too late he has vanishedthe gift has
vanished by means of some spear arrow or club i will never hear that
chap speak after alland my sorrow had a startling extravagance
of emotion even such as i had noticed in the howling sorrow of these
savages in the bush i couldnt have felt more of lonely desolation
somehow had i been robbed of a belief or had missed my destiny in
life    why do you sigh in this beastly way somebody absurd well
absurd good lord mustnt a man everhere give me some tobacco

there was a pause of profound stillness then a match flared and
marlows lean face appeared worn hollow with downward folds and
dropped eyelids with an aspect of concentrated attention and as he
took vigorous draws at his pipe it seemed to retreat and advance out of
the night in the regular flicker of the tiny flame the match went out

absurd he cried this is the worst of trying to tell    here
you all are each moored with two good addresses like a hulk with
two anchors a butcher round one corner a policeman round another
excellent appetites and temperature normalyou hearnormal from
years end to years end and you say absurd absurd beexploded
absurd my dear boys what can you expect from a man who out of sheer
nervousness had just flung overboard a pair of new shoes now i think of
it it is amazing i did not shed tears i am upon the whole proud
of my fortitude i was cut to the quick at the idea of having lost the
inestimable privilege of listening to the gifted kurtz of course i
was wrong the privilege was waiting for me oh yes i heard more than
enough and i was right too a voice he was very little more than a
voice and i heardhimitthis voiceother voicesall of them were
so little more than voicesand the memory of that time itself lingers
around me impalpable like a dying vibration of one immense jabber
silly atrocious sordid savage or simply mean without any kind of
sense voices voiceseven the girl herselfnow

he was silent for a long time

i laid the ghost of his gifts at last with a lie he began suddenly
girl what did i mention a girl oh she is out of itcompletely
theythe women i meanare out of itshould be out of it we must
help them to stay in that beautiful world of their own lest ours
gets worse oh she had to be out of it you should have heard the
disinterred body of mr kurtz saying my intended you would have
perceived directly then how completely she was out of it and the lofty
frontal bone of mr kurtz they say the hair goes on growing sometimes
but thisah specimen was impressively bald the wilderness had patted
him on the head and behold it was like a ballan ivory ball it had
caressed him andlohe had withered it had taken him loved him
embraced him got into his veins consumed his flesh and sealed
his soul to its own by the inconceivable ceremonies of some devilish
initiation he was its spoiled and pampered favorite ivory i should
think so heaps of it stacks of it the old mud shanty was bursting
with it you would think there was not a single tusk left either above
or below the ground in the whole country mostly fossil the manager
had remarked disparagingly it was no more fossil than i am but they
call it fossil when it is dug up it appears these niggers do bury
the tusks sometimesbut evidently they couldnt bury this parcel
deep enough to save the gifted mr kurtz from his fate we filled the
steamboat with it and had to pile a lot on the deck thus he could
see and enjoy as long as he could see because the appreciation of this
favor had remained with him to the last you should have heard him say
my ivory oh yes i heard him my intended my ivory my station my
river my everything belonged to him it made me hold my breath in
expectation of hearing the wilderness burst into a prodigious peal of
laughter that would shake the fixed stars in their places everything
belonged to himbut that was a trifle the thing was to know what he
belonged to how many powers of darkness claimed him for their own that
was the reflection that made you creepy all over it was impossibleit
was not good for one eithertrying to imagine he had taken a high seat
amongst the devils of the landi mean literally you cant understand
how could youwith solid pavement under your feet surrounded by kind
neighbors ready to cheer you or to fall on you stepping delicately
between the butcher and the policeman in the holy terror of scandal and
gallows and lunatic asylumshow can you imagine what particular region
of the first ages a mans untrammeled feet may take him into by the way
of solitudeutter solitude without a policemanby the way of silence
utter silence where no warning voice of a kind neighbor can be heard
whispering of public opinion these little things make all the great
difference when they are gone you must fall back upon your own innate
strength upon your own capacity for faithfulness of course you may
be too much of a fool to go wrongtoo dull even to know you are being
assaulted by the powers of darkness i take it no fool ever made a
bargain for his soul with the devil the fool is too much of a fool or
the devil too much of a devili dont know which or you may be such
a thunderingly exalted creature as to be altogether deaf and blind to
anything but heavenly sights and sounds then the earth for you is only
a standing placeand whether to be like this is your loss or your gain
i wont pretend to say but most of us are neither one nor the other
the earth for us is a place to live in where we must put up with
sights with sounds with smells too by jovebreathe dead hippo
so to speak and not be contaminated and there dont you see
your strength comes in the faith in your ability for the digging of
unostentatious holes to bury the stuff inyour power of devotion
not to yourself but to an obscure backbreaking business and thats
difficult enough mind i am not trying to excuse or even explaini am
trying to account to myself forformr kurtzfor the shade of mr
kurtz this initiated wraith from the back of nowhere honored me with
its amazing confidence before it vanished altogether this was because
it could speak english to me the original kurtz had been educated
partly in england andas he was good enough to say himselfhis
sympathies were in the right place his mother was halfenglish his
father was halffrench all europe contributed to the making of kurtz
and byandby i learned that most appropriately the international
society for the suppression of savage customs had intrusted him with the
making of a report for its future guidance and he had written it too
ive seen it ive read it it was eloquent vibrating with eloquence
but too highstrung i think seventeen pages of close writing he had
found time for but this must have been before hislet us saynerves
went wrong and caused him to preside at certain midnight dances ending
with unspeakable rites whichas far as i reluctantly gathered
from what i heard at various timeswere offered up to himdo you
understandto mr kurtz himself but it was a beautiful piece
of writing the opening paragraph however in the light of later
information strikes me now as ominous he began with the argument
that we whites from the point of development we had arrived at must
necessarily appear to them savages in the nature of supernatural
beingswe approach them with the might as of a deity and so on and
so on by the simple exercise of our will we can exert a power for good
practically unbounded c c from that point he soared and took me
with him the peroration was magnificent though difficult to remember
you know it gave me the notion of an exotic immensity ruled by an
august benevolence it made me tingle with enthusiasm this was the
unbounded power of eloquenceof wordsof burning noble words there
were no practical hints to interrupt the magic current of phrases
unless a kind of note at the foot of the last page scrawled evidently
much later in an unsteady hand may be regarded as the exposition of
a method it was very simple and at the end of that moving appeal to
every altruistic sentiment it blazed at you luminous and terrifying
like a flash of lightning in a serene sky exterminate all the brutes
the curious part was that he had apparently forgotten all about that
valuable postscriptum because later on when he in a sense came to
himself he repeatedly entreated me to take good care of my pamphlet
he called it as it was sure to have in the future a good influence
upon his career i had full information about all these things and
besides as it turned out i was to have the care of his memory ive
done enough for it to give me the indisputable right to lay it if i
choose for an everlasting rest in the dustbin of progress amongst
all the sweepings and figuratively speaking all the dead cats of
civilization but then you see i cant choose he wont be forgotten
whatever he was he was not common he had the power to charm or
frighten rudimentary souls into an aggravated witchdance in his
honor he could also fill the small souls of the pilgrims with bitter
misgivings he had one devoted friend at least and he had conquered
one soul in the world that was neither rudimentary nor tainted with
selfseeking no i cant forget him though i am not prepared to affirm
the fellow was exactly worth the life we lost in getting to him i
missed my late helmsman awfullyi missed him even while his body
was still lying in the pilothouse perhaps you will think it passing
strange this regret for a savage who was no more account than a grain of
sand in a black sahara well dont you see he had done something he
had steered for months i had him at my backa helpan instrument it
was a kind of partnership he steered for mei had to look after him i
worried about his deficiencies and thus a subtle bond had been created
of which i only became aware when it was suddenly broken and the
intimate profundity of that look he gave me when he received his hurt
remains to this day in my memorylike a claim of distant kinship
affirmed in a supreme moment

poor fool if he had only left that shutter alone he had no restraint
no restraintjust like kurtza tree swayed by the wind as soon as
i had put on a dry pair of slippers i dragged him out after first
jerking the spear out of his side which operation i confess i performed
with my eyes shut tight his heels leaped together over the little
doorstep his shoulders were pressed to my breast i hugged him from
behind desperately oh he was heavy heavy heavier than any man on
earth i should imagine then without more ado i tipped him overboard
the current snatched him as though he had been a wisp of grass and i
saw the body roll over twice before i lost sight of it for ever all the
pilgrims and the manager were then congregated on the awningdeck
about the pilothouse chattering at each other like a flock of excited
magpies and there was a scandalized murmur at my heartless promptitude
what they wanted to keep that body hanging about for i cant guess
embalm it maybe but i had also heard another and a very ominous
murmur on the deck below my friends the woodcutters were likewise
scandalized and with a better show of reasonthough i admit that the
reason itself was quite inadmissible oh quite i had made up my mind
that if my late helmsman was to be eaten the fishes alone should have
him he had been a very secondrate helmsman while alive but now he was
dead he might have become a firstclass temptation and possibly cause
some startling trouble besides i was anxious to take the wheel the
man in pink pyjamas showing himself a hopeless duffer at the business

this i did directly the simple funeral was over we were going
halfspeed keeping right in the middle of the stream and i listened
to the talk about me they had given up kurtz they had given up the
station kurtz was dead and the station had been burntand so onand
so on the redhaired pilgrim was beside himself with the thought that
at least this poor kurtz had been properly revenged say we must have
made a glorious slaughter of them in the bush eh what do you think
say he positively danced the bloodthirsty little gingery beggar
and he had nearly fainted when he saw the wounded man i could not help
saying you made a glorious lot of smoke anyhow i had seen from the
way the tops of the bushes rustled and flew that almost all the shots
had gone too high you cant hit anything unless you take aim and fire
from the shoulder but these chaps fired from the hip with their eyes
shut the retreat i maintainedand i was rightwas caused by the
screeching of the steamwhistle upon this they forgot kurtz and began
to howl at me with indignant protests

the manager stood by the wheel murmuring confidentially about the
necessity of getting well away down the river before dark at all events
when i saw in the distance a clearing on the riverside and the outlines
of some sort of building whats this i asked he clapped his hands
in wonder the station he cried i edged in at once still going
halfspeed

through my glasses i saw the slope of a hill interspersed with rare
trees and perfectly free from undergrowth a long decaying building on
the summit was half buried in the high grass the large holes in the
peaked roof gaped black from afar the jungle and the woods made a
background there was no inclosure or fence of any kind but there had
been one apparently for near the house halfadozen slim posts remained
in a row roughly trimmed and with their upper ends ornamented with
round carved balls the rails or whatever there had been between had
disappeared of course the forest surrounded all that the riverbank
was clear and on the waterside i saw a white man under a hat like a
cartwheel beckoning persistently with his whole arm examining the
edge of the forest above and below i was almost certain i could see
movementshuman forms gliding here and there i steamed past prudently
then stopped the engines and let her drift down the man on the shore
began to shout urging us to land we have been attacked screamed
the manager i knowi know its all right yelled back the other as
cheerful as you please come along its all right i am glad

his aspect reminded me of something i had seensomething funny i had
seen somewhere as i maneuvered to get alongside i was asking myself
what does this fellow look like suddenly i got it he looked like
a harlequin his clothes had been made of some stuff that was brown
holland probably but it was covered with patches all over with bright
patches blue red and yellowpatches on the back patches on front
patches on elbows on knees colored binding round his jacket scarlet
edging at the bottom of his trousers and the sunshine made him look
extremely gay and wonderfully neat withal because you could see how
beautifully all this patching had been done a beardless boyish face
very fair no features to speak of nose peeling little blue eyes
smiles and frowns chasing each other over that open countenance like
sunshine and shadow on a windswept plain look out captain he
cried theres a snag lodged in here last night what another snag i
confess i swore shamefully i had nearly holed my cripple to finish off
that charming trip the harlequin on the bank turned his little pug nose
up to me you english he asked all smiles are you i shouted from
the wheel the smiles vanished and he shook his head as if sorry for
my disappointment then he brightened up never mind he cried
encouragingly are we in time i asked he is up there he replied
with a toss of the head up the hill and becoming gloomy all of a
sudden his face was like the autumn sky overcast one moment and bright
the next

when the manager escorted by the pilgrims all of them armed to the
teeth had gone to the house this chap came on board i say i
dont like this these natives are in the bush i said he assured me
earnestly it was all right they are simple people he added well
i am glad you came it took me all my time to keep them off but you
said it was all right i cried oh they meant no harm he said and
as i stared he corrected himself not exactly then vivaciously my
faith your pilothouse wants a clean up in the next breath he advised
me to keep enough steam on the boiler to blow the whistle in case of any
trouble one good screech will do more for you than all your rifles
they are simple people he repeated he rattled away at such a rate
he quite overwhelmed me he seemed to be trying to make up for lots of
silence and actually hinted laughing that such was the case dont
you talk with mr kurtz i said you dont talk with that manyou
listen to him he exclaimed with severe exaltation but now he
waved his arm and in the twinkling of an eye was in the uttermost
depths of despondency in a moment he came up again with a jump
possessed himself of both my hands shook them continuously while he
gabbled brother sailor    honor    pleasure    delight
introduce myself    russian    son of an archpriest
government of tambov    what tobacco english tobacco the excellent
english tobacco now thats brotherly smoke wheres a sailor that
does not smoke

the pipe soothed him and gradually i made out he had run away from
school had gone to sea in a russian ship ran away again served some
time in english ships was now reconciled with the archpriest he made
a point of that but when one is young one must see things gather
experience ideas enlarge the mind here i interrupted you can
never tell here i have met mr kurtz he said youthfully solemn and
reproachful i held my tongue after that it appears he had persuaded a
dutch tradinghouse on the coast to fit him out with stores and goods
and had started for the interior with a light heart and no more idea of
what would happen to him than a baby he had been wandering about that
river for nearly two years alone cut off from everybody and everything
i am not so young as i look i am twentyfive he said at first old
van shuyten would tell me to go to the devil he narrated with keen
enjoyment but i stuck to him and talked and talked till at last he
got afraid i would talk the hindleg off his favorite dog so he gave
me some cheap things and a few guns and told me he hoped he would never
see my face again good old dutchman van shuyten ive sent him one
small lot of ivory a year ago so that he cant call me a little thief
when i get back i hope he got it and for the rest i dont care i had
some wood stacked for you that was my old house did you see

i gave him towsons book he made as though he would kiss me but
restrained himself the only book i had left and i thought i had lost
it he said looking at it ecstatically so many accidents happen to
a man going about alone you know canoes get upset sometimesand
sometimes youve got to clear out so quick when the people get angry
he thumbed the pages you made notes in russian i asked he nodded
i thought they were written in cipher i said he laughed then became
serious i had lots of trouble to keep these people off he said did
they want to kill you i asked oh no he cried and checked
himself why did they attack us i pursued he hesitated then
said shamefacedly they dont want him to go dont they i said
curiously he nodded a nod full of mystery and wisdom i tell you he
cried this man has enlarged my mind he opened his arms wide staring
at me with his little blue eyes that were perfectly round




iii


i looked at him lost in astonishment there he was before me in
motley as though he had absconded from a troupe of mimes enthusiastic
fabulous his very existence was improbable inexplicable and
altogether bewildering he was an insoluble problem it was
inconceivable how he had existed how he had succeeded in getting so
far how he had managed to remainwhy he did not instantly disappear
i went a little farther he said then still a little farthertill
i had gone so far that i dont know how ill ever get back never mind
plenty time i can manage you take kurtz away quickquicki tell
you the glamour of youth enveloped his particolored rags his
destitution his loneliness the essential desolation of his futile
wanderings for monthsfor yearshis life hadnt been worth a days
purchase and there he was gallantly thoughtlessly alive to all
appearance indestructible solely by the virtue of his few years and
of his unreflecting audacity i was seduced into something like
admirationlike envy glamour urged him on glamour kept him unscathed
he surely wanted nothing from the wilderness but space to breathe in and
to push on through his need was to exist and to move onwards at
the greatest possible risk and with a maximum of privation if the
absolutely pure uncalculating unpractical spirit of adventure had ever
ruled a human being it ruled this bepatched youth i almost envied
him the possession of this modest and clear flame it seemed to have
consumed all thought of self so completely that even while he was
talking to you you forgot that it was hethe man before your eyeswho
had gone through these things i did not envy him his devotion to kurtz
though he had not meditated over it it came to him and he accepted it
with a sort of eager fatalism i must say that to me it appeared about
the most dangerous thing in every way he had come upon so far

they had come together unavoidably like two ships becalmed near
each other and lay rubbing sides at last i suppose kurtz wanted an
audience because on a certain occasion when encamped in the forest
they had talked all night or more probably kurtz had talked we talked
of everything he said quite transported at the recollection i
forgot there was such a thing as sleep the night did not seem to last
an hour everything everything    of love too ah he talked to
you of love i said much amused it isnt what you think he cried
almost passionately it was in general he made me see thingsthings

he threw his arms up we were on deck at the time and the headman
of my woodcutters lounging near by turned upon him his heavy and
glittering eyes i looked around and i dont know why but i assure you
that never never before did this land this river this jungle the
very arch of this blazing sky appear to me so hopeless and so dark so
impenetrable to human thought so pitiless to human weakness and ever
since you have been with him of course i said

on the contrary it appears their intercourse had been very much broken
by various causes he had as he informed me proudly managed to nurse
kurtz through two illnesses he alluded to it as you would to some risky
feat but as a rule kurtz wandered alone far in the depths of the
forest very often coming to this station i had to wait days and
days before he would turn up he said ah it was worth waiting
forsometimes what was he doing exploring or what i asked oh
yes of course he had discovered lots of villages a lake toohe
did not know exactly in what direction it was dangerous to inquire
too muchbut mostly his expeditions had been for ivory but he had no
goods to trade with by that time i objected theres a good lot of
cartridges left even yet he answered looking away to speak plainly
he raided the country i said he nodded not alone surely he
muttered something about the villages round that lake kurtz got the
tribe to follow him did he i suggested he fidgeted a little they
adored him he said the tone of these words was so extraordinary that
i looked at him searchingly it was curious to see his mingled eagerness
and reluctance to speak of kurtz the man filled his life occupied his
thoughts swayed his emotions what can you expect he burst out he
came to them with thunder and lightning you knowand they had never
seen anything like itand very terrible he could be very terrible
you cant judge mr kurtz as you would an ordinary man no no no
nowjust to give you an ideai dont mind telling you he wanted to
shoot me too one daybut i dont judge him shoot you i cried
what for well i had a small lot of ivory the chief of that village
near my house gave me you see i used to shoot game for them well
he wanted it and wouldnt hear reason he declared he would shoot me
unless i gave him the ivory and then cleared out of the country because
he could do so and had a fancy for it and there was nothing on earth
to prevent him killing whom he jolly well pleased and it was true too
i gave him the ivory what did i care but i didnt clear out no no i
couldnt leave him i had to be careful of course till we got friendly
again for a time he had his second illness then afterwards i had to
keep out of the way but i didnt mind he was living for the most part
in those villages on the lake when he came down to the river sometimes
he would take to me and sometimes it was better for me to be careful
this man suffered too much he hated all this and somehow he couldnt
get away when i had a chance i begged him to try and leave while there
was time i offered to go back with him and he would say yes and then
he would remain go off on another ivory hunt disappear for weeks
forget himself amongst these peopleforget himselfyou know why
hes mad i said he protested indignantly mr kurtz couldnt be mad
if i had heard him talk only two days ago i wouldnt dare hint at
such a thing    i had taken up my binoculars while we talked and was
looking at the shore sweeping the limit of the forest at each side and
at the back of the house the consciousness of there being people in
that bush so silent so quietas silent and quiet as the ruined house
on the hillmade me uneasy there was no sign on the face of nature
of this amazing tale that was not so much told as suggested to me in
desolate exclamations completed by shrugs in interrupted phrases in
hints ending in deep sighs the woods were unmoved like a maskheavy
like the closed door of a prisonthey looked with their air of hidden
knowledge of patient expectation of unapproachable silence the
russian was explaining to me that it was only lately that mr kurtz had
come down to the river bringing along with him all the fighting men of
that lake tribe he had been absent for several monthsgetting himself
adored i supposeand had come down unexpectedly with the intention to
all appearance of making a raid either across the river or down stream
evidently the appetite for more ivory had got the better of thewhat
shall i sayless material aspirations however he had got much worse
suddenly i heard he was lying helpless and so i came uptook my
chance said the russian oh he is bad very bad i directed my
glass to the house there were no signs of life but there was the
ruined roof the long mud wall peeping above the grass with three
little square windowholes no two of the same size all this brought
within reach of my hand as it were and then i made a brusque movement
and one of the remaining posts of that vanished fence leaped up in the
field of my glass you remember i told you i had been struck at the
distance by certain attempts at ornamentation rather remarkable in the
ruinous aspect of the place now i had suddenly a nearer view and its
first result was to make me throw my head back as if before a blow then
i went carefully from post to post with my glass and i saw my mistake
these round knobs were not ornamental but symbolic they were expressive
and puzzling striking and disturbingfood for thought and also for
the vultures if there had been any looking down from the sky but at all
events for such ants as were industrious enough to ascend the pole
they would have been even more impressive those heads on the stakes if
their faces had not been turned to the house only one the first i had
made out was facing my way i was not so shocked as you may think the
start back i had given was really nothing but a movement of surprise
i had expected to see a knob of wood there you know i returned
deliberately to the first i had seenand there it was black dried
sunken with closed eyelidsa head that seemed to sleep at the top of
that pole and with the shrunken dry lips showing a narrow white line
of the teeth was smiling too smiling continuously at some endless and
jocose dream of that eternal slumber

i am not disclosing any trade secrets in fact the manager said
afterwards that mr kurtzs methods had ruined the district i have no
opinion on that point but i want you clearly to understand that there
was nothing exactly profitable in these heads being there they only
showed that mr kurtz lacked restraint in the gratification of his
various lusts that there was something wanting in himsome small
matter which when the pressing need arose could not be found under
his magnificent eloquence whether he knew of this deficiency himself i
cant say i think the knowledge came to him at lastonly at the very
last but the wilderness had found him out early and had taken on him a
terrible vengeance for the fantastic invasion i think it had whispered
to him things about himself which he did not know things of which he
had no conception till he took counsel with this great solitudeand the
whisper had proved irresistibly fascinating it echoed loudly within him
because he was hollow at the core    i put down the glass and the
head that had appeared near enough to be spoken to seemed at once to
have leaped away from me into inaccessible distance

the admirer of mr kurtz was a bit crestfallen in a hurried
indistinct voice he began to assure me he had not dared to take
thesesay symbolsdown he was not afraid of the natives they would
not stir till mr kurtz gave the word his ascendency was extraordinary
the camps of these people surrounded the place and the chiefs came
every day to see him they would crawl    i dont want to know
anything of the ceremonies used when approaching mr kurtz i shouted
curious this feeling that came over me that such details would be more
intolerable than those heads drying on the stakes under mr kurtzs
windows after all that was only a savage sight while i seemed at
one bound to have been transported into some lightless region of subtle
horrors where pure uncomplicated savagery was a positive relief being
something that had a right to existobviouslyin the sunshine the
young man looked at me with surprise i suppose it did not occur to him
mr kurtz was no idol of mine he forgot i hadnt heard any of these
splendid monologues on what was it on love justice conduct of
lifeor what not if it had come to crawling before mr kurtz he
crawled as much as the veriest savage of them all i had no idea of the
conditions he said these heads were the heads of rebels i shocked him
excessively by laughing rebels what would be the next definition i
was to hear there had been enemies criminals workersand these
were rebels those rebellious heads looked very subdued to me on their
sticks you dont know how such a life tries a man like kurtz cried
kurtzs last disciple well and you i said i i i am a simple
man i have no great thoughts i want nothing from anybody how can
you compare me to    his feelings were too much for speech and
suddenly he broke down i dont understand he groaned ive been
doing my best to keep him alive and thats enough i had no hand in
all this i have no abilities there hasnt been a drop of medicine or a
mouthful of invalid food for months here he was shamefully abandoned
a man like this with such ideas shamefully shamefully iihavent
slept for the last ten nights

his voice lost itself in the calm of the evening the long shadows of
the forest had slipped down hill while we talked had gone far beyond
the ruined hovel beyond the symbolic row of stakes all this was in the
gloom while we down there were yet in the sunshine and the stretch
of the river abreast of the clearing glittered in a still and dazzling
splendor with a murky and overshadowed bend above and below not a
living soul was seen on the shore the bushes did not rustle

suddenly round the corner of the house a group of men appeared as
though they had come up from the ground they waded waistdeep in the
grass in a compact body bearing an improvised stretcher in their
midst instantly in the emptiness of the landscape a cry arose whose
shrillness pierced the still air like a sharp arrow flying straight to
the very heart of the land and as if by enchantment streams of human
beingsof naked human beingswith spears in their hands with bows
with shields with wild glances and savage movements were poured into
the clearing by the darkfaced and pensive forest the bushes shook the
grass swayed for a time and then everything stood still in attentive
immobility

now if he does not say the right thing to them we are all done for
said the russian at my elbow the knot of men with the stretcher had
stopped too halfway to the steamer as if petrified i saw the man on
the stretcher sit up lank and with an uplifted arm above the shoulders
of the bearers let us hope that the man who can talk so well of love
in general will find some particular reason to spare us this time i
said i resented bitterly the absurd danger of our situation as if
to be at the mercy of that atrocious phantom had been a dishonoring
necessity i could not hear a sound but through my glasses i saw the
thin arm extended commandingly the lower jaw moving the eyes of
that apparition shining darkly far in its bony head that nodded with
grotesque jerks kurtzkurtzthat means short in germandont it
well the name was as true as everything else in his lifeand death
he looked at least seven feet long his covering had fallen off and his
body emerged from it pitiful and appalling as from a windingsheet i
could see the cage of his ribs all astir the bones of his arm waving
it was as though an animated image of death carved out of old ivory had
been shaking its hand with menaces at a motionless crowd of men made of
dark and glittering bronze i saw him open his mouth wideit gave him
a weirdly voracious aspect as though he had wanted to swallow all the
air all the earth all the men before him a deep voice reached
me faintly he must have been shouting he fell back suddenly the
stretcher shook as the bearers staggered forward again and almost at
the same time i noticed that the crowd of savages was vanishing without
any perceptible movement of retreat as if the forest that had ejected
these beings so suddenly had drawn them in again as the breath is drawn
in a long aspiration

some of the pilgrims behind the stretcher carried his armstwo
shotguns a heavy rifle and a light revolvercarbinethe thunderbolts
of that pitiful jupiter the manager bent over him murmuring as
he walked beside his head they laid him down in one of the little
cabinsjust a room for a bedplace and a campstool or two you know
we had brought his belated correspondence and a lot of torn envelopes
and open letters littered his bed his hand roamed feebly amongst these
papers i was struck by the fire of his eyes and the composed languor of
his expression it was not so much the exhaustion of disease he did not
seem in pain this shadow looked satiated and calm as though for the
moment it had had its fill of all the emotions

he rustled one of the letters and looking straight in my face said
i am glad somebody had been writing to him about me these special
recommendations were turning up again the volume of tone he emitted
without effort almost without the trouble of moving his lips amazed
me a voice a voice it was grave profound vibrating while the man
did not seem capable of a whisper however he had enough strength in
himfactitious no doubtto very nearly make an end of us as you shall
hear directly

the manager appeared silently in the doorway i stepped out at once
and he drew the curtain after me the russian eyed curiously by the
pilgrims was staring at the shore i followed the direction of his
glance

dark human shapes could be made out in the distance flitting
indistinctly against the gloomy border of the forest and near the river
two bronze figures leaning on tall spears stood in the sunlight under
fantastic headdresses of spotted skins warlike and still in statuesque
repose and from right to left along the lighted shore moved a wild and
gorgeous apparition of a woman

she walked with measured steps draped in striped and fringed cloths
treading the earth proudly with a slight jingle and flash of barbarous
ornaments she carried her head high her hair was done in the shape of
a helmet she had brass leggings to the knee brass wire gauntlets to
the elbow a crimson spot on her tawny cheek innumerable necklaces of
glass beads on her neck bizarre things charms gifts of witchmen
that hung about her glittered and trembled at every step she must have
had the value of several elephant tusks upon her she was savage and
superb wildeyed and magnificent there was something ominous and
stately in her deliberate progress and in the hush that had fallen
suddenly upon the whole sorrowful land the immense wilderness the
colossal body of the fecund and mysterious life seemed to look at her
pensive as though it had been looking at the image of its own tenebrous
and passionate soul

she came abreast of the steamer stood still and faced us her long
shadow fell to the waters edge her face had a tragic and fierce
aspect of wild sorrow and of dumb pain mingled with the fear of some
struggling halfshaped resolve she stood looking at us without a
stir and like the wilderness itself with an air of brooding over an
inscrutable purpose a whole minute passed and then she made a step
forward there was a low jingle a glint of yellow metal a sway of
fringed draperies and she stopped as if her heart had failed her the
young fellow by my side growled the pilgrims murmured at my back
she looked at us all as if her life had depended upon the unswerving
steadiness of her glance suddenly she opened her bared arms and threw
them up rigid above her head as though in an uncontrollable desire to
touch the sky and at the same time the swift shadows darted out on the
earth swept around on the river gathering the steamer into a shadowy
embrace a formidable silence hung over the scene

she turned away slowly walked on following the bank and passed into
the bushes to the left once only her eyes gleamed back at us in the
dusk of the thickets before she disappeared

if she had offered to come aboard i really think i would have tried to
shoot her said the man of patches nervously i had been risking my
life every day for the last fortnight to keep her out of the house she
got in one day and kicked up a row about those miserable rags i picked
up in the storeroom to mend my clothes with i wasnt decent at least
it must have been that for she talked like a fury to kurtz for an hour
pointing at me now and then i dont understand the dialect of this
tribe luckily for me i fancy kurtz felt too ill that day to care or
there would have been mischief i dont understand    noits too
much for me ah well its all over now

at this moment i heard kurtzs deep voice behind the curtain save
mesave the ivory you mean dont tell me save me why ive had
to save you you are interrupting my plans now sick sick not so sick
as you would like to believe never mind ill carry my ideas out
yeti will return ill show you what can be done you with your little
peddling notionsyou are interfering with me i will return i

the manager came out he did me the honor to take me under the arm and
lead me aside he is very low very low he said he considered it
necessary to sigh but neglected to be consistently sorrowful we have
done all we could for himhavent we but there is no disguising the
fact mr kurtz has done more harm than good to the company he did
not see the time was not ripe for vigorous action cautiously
cautiouslythats my principle we must be cautious yet the district
is closed to us for a time deplorable upon the whole the trade will
suffer i dont deny there is a remarkable quantity of ivorymostly
fossil we must save it at all eventsbut look how precarious the
position isand why because the method is unsound do you said i
looking at the shore call it unsound method without doubt he
exclaimed hotly dont you    no method at all i murmured
after a while exactly he exulted i anticipated this shows a
complete want of judgment it is my duty to point it out in the proper
quarter oh said i that fellowwhats his namethe brickmaker
will make a readable report for you he appeared confounded for a
moment it seemed to me i had never breathed an atmosphere so vile
and i turned mentally to kurtz for reliefpositively for relief
nevertheless i think mr kurtz is a remarkable man i said with
emphasis he started dropped on me a cold heavy glance said very
quietly he was and turned his back on me my hour of favor was
over i found myself lumped along with kurtz as a partisan of methods
for which the time was not ripe i was unsound ah but it was something
to have at least a choice of nightmares

i had turned to the wilderness really not to mr kurtz who i was
ready to admit was as good as buried and for a moment it seemed to me
as if i also were buried in a vast grave full of unspeakable secrets i
felt an intolerable weight oppressing my breast the smell of the damp
earth the unseen presence of victorious corruption the darkness of an
impenetrable night    the russian tapped me on the shoulder i heard
him mumbling and stammering something about brother seamancouldnt
concealknowledge of matters that would affect mr kurtzs reputation
i waited for him evidently mr kurtz was not in his grave i suspect
that for him mr kurtz was one of the immortals well said i at last
speak out as it happens i am mr kurtzs friendin a way

he stated with a good deal of formality that had we not been of the
same profession he would have kept the matter to himself without
regard to consequences he suspected there was an active illwill
towards him on the part of these white men that you are right i
said remembering a certain conversation i had overheard the manager
thinks you ought to be hanged he showed a concern at this intelligence
which amused me at first i had better get out of the way quietly he
said earnestly i can do no more for kurtz now and they would soon
find some excuse whats to stop them theres a military post three
hundred miles from here well upon my word said i perhaps you
had better go if you have any friends amongst the savages near by
plenty he said they are simple peopleand i want nothing you
know he stood biting his lips then i dont want any harm to happen
to these whites here but of course i was thinking of mr kurtzs
reputationbut you are a brother seaman and all right said i
after a time mr kurtzs reputation is safe with me i did not know
how truly i spoke

he informed me lowering his voice that it was kurtz who had ordered
the attack to be made on the steamer he hated sometimes the idea of
being taken awayand then again    but i dont understand these
matters i am a simple man he thought it would scare you awaythat you
would give it up thinking him dead i could not stop him oh i had an
awful time of it this last month very well i said he is all right
now yeees he muttered not very convinced apparently thanks
said i i shall keep my eyes open but quieteh he urged
anxiously it would be awful for his reputation if anybody here i
promised a complete discretion with great gravity i have a canoe and
three black fellows waiting not very far i am off could you give me a
few martinihenry cartridges i could and did with proper secrecy he
helped himself with a wink at me to a handful of my tobacco between
sailorsyou knowgood english tobacco at the door of the pilothouse
he turned round i say havent you a pair of shoes you could spare
he raised one leg look the soles were tied with knotted strings
sandalwise under his bare feet i rooted out an old pair at which he
looked with admiration before tucking it under his left arm one of his
pockets bright red was bulging with cartridges from the other dark
blue peeped towsons inquiry c c he seemed to think himself
excellently well equipped for a renewed encounter with the wilderness
ah ill never never meet such a man again you ought to have heard
him recite poetryhis own too it was he told me poetry he rolled
his eyes at the recollection of these delights oh he enlarged my
mind goodby said i he shook hands and vanished in the night
sometimes i ask myself whether i had ever really seen himwhether it
was possible to meet such a phenomenon

when i woke up shortly after midnight his warning came to my mind with
its hint of danger that seemed in the starred darkness real enough to
make me get up for the purpose of having a look round on the hill a
big fire burned illuminating fitfully a crooked corner of the
stationhouse one of the agents with a picket of a few of our blacks
armed for the purpose was keeping guard over the ivory but deep within
the forest red gleams that wavered that seemed to sink and rise from
the ground amongst confused columnar shapes of intense blackness showed
the exact position of the camp where mr kurtzs adorers were keeping
their uneasy vigil the monotonous beating of a big drum filled the air
with muffled shocks and a lingering vibration a steady droning sound of
many men chanting each to himself some weird incantation came out from
the black flat wall of the woods as the humming of bees comes out of
a hive and had a strange narcotic effect upon my halfawake senses
i believe i dozed off leaning over the rail till an abrupt burst of
yells an overwhelming outbreak of a pentup and mysterious frenzy woke
me up in a bewildered wonder it was cut short all at once and the
low droning went on with an effect of audible and soothing silence i
glanced casually into the little cabin a light was burning within but
mr kurtz was not there

i think i would have raised an outcry if i had believed my eyes but i
didnt believe them at firstthe thing seemed so impossible the fact
is i was completely unnerved by a sheer blank fright pure abstract
terror unconnected with any distinct shape of physical danger what
made this emotion so overpowering washow shall i define itthe moral
shock i received as if something altogether monstrous intolerable to
thought and odious to the soul had been thrust upon me unexpectedly
this lasted of course the merest fraction of a second and then the
usual sense of commonplace deadly danger the possibility of a sudden
onslaught and massacre or something of the kind which i saw impending
was positively welcome and composing it pacified me in fact so much
that i did not raise an alarm

there was an agent buttoned up inside an ulster and sleeping on a chair
on deck within three feet of me the yells had not awakened him he
snored very slightly i left him to his slumbers and leaped ashore i
did not betray mr kurtzit was ordered i should never betray himit
was written i should be loyal to the nightmare of my choice i was
anxious to deal with this shadow by myself aloneand to this day i
dont know why i was so jealous of sharing with anyone the peculiar
blackness of that experience

as soon as i got on the bank i saw a traila broad trail through the
grass i remember the exultation with which i said to myself he cant
walkhe is crawling on allfoursive got him the grass was wet
with dew i strode rapidly with clenched fists i fancy i had some vague
notion of falling upon him and giving him a drubbing i dont know i
had some imbecile thoughts the knitting old woman with the cat obtruded
herself upon my memory as a most improper person to be sitting at the
other end of such an affair i saw a row of pilgrims squirting lead in
the air out of winchesters held to the hip i thought i would never get
back to the steamer and imagined myself living alone and unarmed in the
woods to an advanced age such silly thingsyou know and i remember
i confounded the beat of the drum with the beating of my heart and was
pleased at its calm regularity

i kept to the track thoughthen stopped to listen the night was very
clear a dark blue space sparkling with dew and starlight in which
black things stood very still i thought i could see a kind of motion
ahead of me i was strangely cocksure of everything that night i
actually left the track and ran in a wide semicircle i verily believe
chuckling to myself so as to get in front of that stir of that motion
i had seenif indeed i had seen anything i was circumventing kurtz as
though it had been a boyish game

i came upon him and if he had not heard me coming i would have
fallen over him too but he got up in time he rose unsteady long
pale indistinct like a vapor exhaled by the earth and swayed
slightly misty and silent before me while at my back the fires loomed
between the trees and the murmur of many voices issued from the forest
i had cut him off cleverly but when actually confronting him i seemed
to come to my senses i saw the danger in its right proportion it was
by no means over yet suppose he began to shout though he could hardly
stand there was still plenty of vigor in his voice go awayhide
yourself he said in that profound tone it was very awful i glanced
back we were within thirty yards from the nearest fire a black figure
stood up strode on long black legs waving long black arms across the
glow it had hornsantelope horns i thinkon its head some sorcerer
some witchman no doubt it looked fiendlike enough do you know what
you are doing i whispered perfectly he answered raising his voice
for that single word it sounded to me far off and yet loud like a hail
through a speakingtrumpet if he makes a row we are lost i thought
to myself this clearly was not a case for fisticuffs even apart from
the very natural aversion i had to beat that shadowthis wandering and
tormented thing you will be lost i saidutterly lost one gets
sometimes such a flash of inspiration you know i did say the right
thing though indeed he could not have been more irretrievably lost than
he was at this very moment when the foundations of our intimacy were
being laidto endureto endureeven to the endeven beyond

i had immense plans he muttered irresolutely yes said i but if
you try to shout ill smash your head with there was not a stick or
a stone near i will throttle you for good i corrected myself i was
on the threshold of great things he pleaded in a voice of longing
with a wistfulness of tone that made my blood run cold and now for
this stupid scoundrel your success in europe is assured in any
case i affirmed steadily i did not want to have the throttling of
him you understandand indeed it would have been very little use for
any practical purpose i tried to break the spellthe heavy mute spell
of the wildernessthat seemed to draw him to its pitiless breast by the
awakening of forgotten and brutal instincts by the memory of gratified
and monstrous passions this alone i was convinced had driven him out
to the edge of the forest to the bush towards the gleam of fires the
throb of drums the drone of weird incantations this alone had beguiled
his unlawful soul beyond the bounds of permitted aspirations and dont
you see the terror of the position was not in being knocked on the
headthough i had a very lively sense of that danger toobut in this
that i had to deal with a being to whom i could not appeal in the
name of anything high or low i had even like the niggers to invoke
himhimself his own exalted and incredible degradation there was
nothing either above or below him and i knew it he had kicked himself
loose of the earth confound the man he had kicked the very earth to
pieces he was alone and i before him did not know whether i stood
on the ground or floated in the air ive been telling you what we
saidrepeating the phrases we pronouncedbut whats the good they
were common everyday wordsthe familiar vague sounds exchanged on
every waking day of life but what of that they had behind them to my
mind the terrific suggestiveness of words heard in dreams of phrases
spoken in nightmares soul if anybody had ever struggled with a soul
i am the man and i wasnt arguing with a lunatic either believe me
or not his intelligence was perfectly clearconcentrated it is true
upon himself with horrible intensity yet clear and therein was my only
chancebarring of course the killing him there and then which wasnt
so good on account of unavoidable noise but his soul was mad being
alone in the wilderness it had looked within itself and by heavens i
tell you it had gone mad i hadfor my sins i supposeto go through
the ordeal of looking into it myself no eloquence could have been so
withering to ones belief in mankind as his final burst of sincerity
he struggled with himself too i saw iti heard it i saw the
inconceivable mystery of a soul that knew no restraint no faith and
no fear yet struggling blindly with itself i kept my head pretty well
but when i had him at last stretched on the couch i wiped my forehead
while my legs shook under me as though i had carried half a ton on my
back down that hill and yet i had only supported him his bony arm
clasped round my neckand he was not much heavier than a child

when next day we left at noon the crowd of whose presence behind the
curtain of trees i had been acutely conscious all the time flowed out
of the woods again filled the clearing covered the slope with a mass
of naked breathing quivering bronze bodies i steamed up a bit then
swung downstream and two thousand eyes followed the evolutions of
the splashing thumping fierce riverdemon beating the water with its
terrible tail and breathing black smoke into the air in front of the
first rank along the river three men plastered with bright red earth
from head to foot strutted to and fro restlessly when we came abreast
again they faced the river stamped their feet nodded their horned
heads swayed their scarlet bodies they shook towards the fierce
riverdemon a bunch of black feathers a mangy skin with a pendent
tailsomething that looked like a dried gourd they shouted
periodically together strings of amazing words that resembled no sounds
of human language and the deep murmurs of the crowd interrupted
suddenly were like the response of some satanic litany

we had carried kurtz into the pilothouse there was more air there
lying on the couch he stared through the open shutter there was an
eddy in the mass of human bodies and the woman with helmeted head and
tawny cheeks rushed out to the very brink of the stream she put out her
hands shouted something and all that wild mob took up the shout in a
roaring chorus of articulated rapid breathless utterance

do you understand this i asked

he kept on looking out past me with fiery longing eyes with a mingled
expression of wistfulness and hate he made no answer but i saw a
smile a smile of indefinable meaning appear on his colorless lips
that a moment after twitched convulsively do i not he said slowly
gasping as if the words had been torn out of him by a supernatural
power

i pulled the string of the whistle and i did this because i saw the
pilgrims on deck getting out their rifles with an air of anticipating a
jolly lark at the sudden screech there was a movement of abject terror
through that wedged mass of bodies dont dont you frighten them
away cried someone on deck disconsolately i pulled the string
time after time they broke and ran they leaped they crouched they
swerved they dodged the flying terror of the sound the three red chaps
had fallen flat face down on the shore as though they had been shot
dead only the barbarous and superb woman did not so much as flinch
and stretched tragically her bare arms after us over the somber and
glittering river

and then that imbecile crowd down on the deck started their little fun
and i could see nothing more for smoke

the brown current ran swiftly out of the heart of darkness bearing us
down towards the sea with twice the speed of our upward progress and
kurtzs life was running swiftly too ebbing ebbing out of his heart
into the sea of inexorable time the manager was very placid he had
no vital anxieties now he took us both in with a comprehensive and
satisfied glance the affair had come off as well as could be wished
i saw the time approaching when i would be left alone of the party of
unsound method the pilgrims looked upon me with disfavor i was
so to speak numbered with the dead it is strange how i accepted this
unforeseen partnership this choice of nightmares forced upon me in the
tenebrous land invaded by these mean and greedy phantoms

kurtz discoursed a voice a voice it rang deep to the very last it
survived his strength to hide in the magnificent folds of eloquence the
barren darkness of his heart oh he struggled he struggled the wastes
of his weary brain were haunted by shadowy images nowimages of wealth
and fame revolving obsequiously round his unextinguishable gift of
noble and lofty expression my intended my station my career my
ideasthese were the subjects for the occasional utterances of elevated
sentiments the shade of the original kurtz frequented the bedside of
the hollow sham whose fate it was to be buried presently in the mold of
primeval earth but both the diabolic love and the unearthly hate of
the mysteries it had penetrated fought for the possession of that
soul satiated with primitive emotions avid of lying fame of sham
distinction of all the appearances of success and power

sometimes he was contemptibly childish he desired to have kings meet
him at railwaystations on his return from some ghastly nowhere where
he intended to accomplish great things you show them you have in you
something that is really profitable and then there will be no limits to
the recognition of your ability he would say of course you must take
care of the motivesright motivesalways the long reaches that were
like one and the same reach monotonous bends that were exactly alike
slipped past the steamer with their multitude of secular trees looking
patiently after this grimy fragment of another world the forerunner
of change of conquest of trade of massacres of blessings i looked
aheadpiloting close the shutter said kurtz suddenly one day i
cant bear to look at this i did so there was a silence oh but i
will wring your heart yet he cried at the invisible wilderness

we broke downas i had expectedand had to lie up for repairs at the
head of an island this delay was the first thing that shook
kurtzs confidence one morning he gave me a packet of papers and a
photographthe lot tied together with a shoestring keep this for
me he said this noxious fool meaning the manager is capable of
prying into my boxes when i am not looking in the afternoon i saw him
he was lying on his back with closed eyes and i withdrew quietly but
i heard him mutter live rightly die die    i listened there was
nothing more was he rehearsing some speech in his sleep or was it a
fragment of a phrase from some newspaper article he had been writing
for the papers and meant to do so again for the furthering of my
ideas its a duty

his was an impenetrable darkness i looked at him as you peer down at
a man who is lying at the bottom of a precipice where the sun never
shines but i had not much time to give him because i was helping the
enginedriver to take to pieces the leaky cylinders to straighten a
bent connectingrod and in other such matters i lived in an
infernal mess of rust filings nuts bolts spanners hammers
ratchetdrillsthings i abominate because i dont get on with them i
tended the little forge we fortunately had aboard i toiled wearily in a
wretched scrapheapunless i had the shakes too bad to stand

one evening coming in with a candle i was startled to hear him say a
little tremulously i am lying here in the dark waiting for death
the light was within a foot of his eyes i forced myself to murmur oh
nonsense and stood over him as if transfixed

anything approaching the change that came over his features i have
never seen before and hope never to see again oh i wasnt touched
i was fascinated it was as though a veil had been rent i saw on that
ivory face the expression of somber pride of ruthless power of craven
terrorof an intense and hopeless despair did he live his life again
in every detail of desire temptation and surrender during that supreme
moment of complete knowledge he cried in a whisper at some image at
some visionhe cried out twice a cry that was no more than a breath

the horror the horror

i blew the candle out and left the cabin the pilgrims were dining in
the messroom and i took my place opposite the manager who lifted his
eyes to give me a questioning glance which i successfully ignored
he leaned back serene with that peculiar smile of his sealing the
unexpressed depths of his meanness a continuous shower of small flies
streamed upon the lamp upon the cloth upon our hands and faces
suddenly the managers boy put his insolent black head in the doorway
and said in a tone of scathing contempt

mistah kurtzhe dead

all the pilgrims rushed out to see i remained and went on with my
dinner i believe i was considered brutally callous however i did not
eat much there was a lamp in therelight dont you knowand outside
it was so beastly beastly dark i went no more near the remarkable man
who had pronounced a judgment upon the adventures of his soul on this
earth the voice was gone what else had been there but i am of course
aware that next day the pilgrims buried something in a muddy hole

and then they very nearly buried me

however as you see i did not go to join kurtz there and then i did
not i remained to dream the nightmare out to the end and to show
my loyalty to kurtz once more destiny my destiny droll thing life
isthat mysterious arrangement of merciless logic for a futile purpose
the most you can hope from it is some knowledge of yourselfthat comes
too latea crop of unextinguishable regrets i have wrestled with
death it is the most unexciting contest you can imagine it takes place
in an impalpable grayness with nothing underfoot with nothing around
without spectators without clamor without glory without the great
desire of victory without the great fear of defeat in a sickly
atmosphere of tepid skepticism without much belief in your own right
and still less in that of your adversary if such is the form of
ultimate wisdom then life is a greater riddle than some of us think
it to be i was within a hairsbreadth of the last opportunity for
pronouncement and i found with humiliation that probably i would
have nothing to say this is the reason why i affirm that kurtz was a
remarkable man he had something to say he said it since i had peeped
over the edge myself i understand better the meaning of his stare that
could not see the flame of the candle but was wide enough to embrace
the whole universe piercing enough to penetrate all the hearts that
beat in the darkness he had summed uphe had judged the horror he
was a remarkable man after all this was the expression of some sort
of belief it had candor it had conviction it had a vibrating note
of revolt in its whisper it had the appalling face of a glimpsed
truththe strange commingling of desire and hate and it is not my own
extremity i remember besta vision of grayness without form filled
with physical pain and a careless contempt for the evanescence of all
thingseven of this pain itself no it is his extremity that i seem to
have lived through true he had made that last stride he had stepped
over the edge while i had been permitted to draw back my hesitating
foot and perhaps in this is the whole difference perhaps all the
wisdom and all truth and all sincerity are just compressed into that
inappreciable moment of time in which we step over the threshold of the
invisible perhaps i like to think my summingup would not have been
a word of careless contempt better his crymuch better it was
an affirmation a moral victory paid for by innumerable defeats by
abominable terrors by abominable satisfactions but it was a victory
that is why i have remained loyal to kurtz to the last and even beyond
when a long time after i heard once more not his own voice but
the echo of his magnificent eloquence thrown to me from a soul as
translucently pure as a cliff of crystal

no they did not bury me though there is a period of time which i
remember mistily with a shuddering wonder like a passage through some
inconceivable world that had no hope in it and no desire i found myself
back in the sepulchral city resenting the sight of people hurrying
through the streets to filch a little money from each other to devour
their infamous cookery to gulp their unwholesome beer to dream their
insignificant and silly dreams they trespassed upon my thoughts they
were intruders whose knowledge of life was to me an irritating pretense
because i felt so sure they could not possibly know the things i knew
their bearing which was simply the bearing of commonplace individuals
going about their business in the assurance of perfect safety was
offensive to me like the outrageous flauntings of folly in the face of
a danger it is unable to comprehend i had no particular desire to
enlighten them but i had some difficulty in restraining myself from
laughing in their faces so full of stupid importance i dare say i was
not very well at that time i tottered about the streetsthere were
various affairs to settlegrinning bitterly at perfectly respectable
persons i admit my behavior was inexcusable but then my temperature
was seldom normal in these days my dear aunts endeavors to nurse up
my strength seemed altogether beside the mark it was not my strength
that wanted nursing it was my imagination that wanted soothing i kept
the bundle of papers given me by kurtz not knowing exactly what to do
with it his mother had died lately watched over as i was told by
his intended a cleanshaved man with an official manner and wearing
goldrimmed spectacles called on me one day and made inquiries at
first circuitous afterwards suavely pressing about what he was pleased
to denominate certain documents i was not surprised because i had
had two rows with the manager on the subject out there i had refused
to give up the smallest scrap out of that package and i took the same
attitude with the spectacled man he became darkly menacing at last
and with much heat argued that the company had the right to every bit
of information about its territories and said he mr kurtzs
knowledge of unexplored regions must have been necessarily extensive
and peculiarowing to his great abilities and to the deplorable
circumstances in which he had been placed thereforei assured him mr
kurtzs knowledge however extensive did not bear upon the problems
of commerce or administration he invoked then the name of science it
would be an incalculable loss if c c i offered him the report on
the suppression of savage customs with the postscriptum torn off he
took it up eagerly but ended by sniffing at it with an air of contempt
this is not what we had a right to expect he remarked expect
nothing else i said there are only private letters he withdrew
upon some threat of legal proceedings and i saw him no more but
another fellow calling himself kurtzs cousin appeared two days later
and was anxious to hear all the details about his dear relatives last
moments incidentally he gave me to understand that kurtz had been
essentially a great musician there was the making of an immense
success said the man who was an organist i believe with lank gray
hair flowing over a greasy coatcollar i had no reason to doubt
his statement and to this day i am unable to say what was kurtzs
profession whether he ever had anywhich was the greatest of his
talents i had taken him for a painter who wrote for the papers or else
for a journalist who could paintbut even the cousin who took snuff
during the interview could not tell me what he had beenexactly he
was a universal geniuson that point i agreed with the old chap who
thereupon blew his nose noisily into a large cotton handkerchief and
withdrew in senile agitation bearing off some family letters and
memoranda without importance ultimately a journalist anxious to know
something of the fate of his dear colleague turned up this visitor
informed me kurtzs proper sphere ought to have been politics on the
popular side he had furry straight eyebrows bristly hair cropped
short an eyeglass on a broad ribbon and becoming expansive
confessed his opinion that kurtz really couldnt write a bitbut
heavens how that man could talk he electrified large meetings he had
faithdont you seehe had the faith he could get himself to believe
anythinganything he would have been a splendid leader of an extreme
party what party i asked any party answered the other he
was ananextremist did i not think so i assented did i know he
asked with a sudden flash of curiosity what it was that had induced
him to go out there yes said i and forthwith handed him the
famous report for publication if he thought fit he glanced through it
hurriedly mumbling all the time judged it would do and took himself
off with this plunder

thus i was left at last with a slim packet of letters and the girls
portrait she struck me as beautifuli mean she had a beautiful
expression i know that the sunlight can be made to lie too yet one
felt that no manipulation of light and pose could have conveyed the
delicate shade of truthfulness upon those features she seemed ready to
listen without mental reservation without suspicion without a thought
for herself i concluded i would go and give her back her portrait
and those letters myself curiosity yes and also some other feeling
perhaps all that had been kurtzs had passed out of my hands his soul
his body his station his plans his ivory his career there remained
only his memory and his intendedand i wanted to give that up too to
the past in a wayto surrender personally all that remained of him
with me to that oblivion which is the last word of our common fate i
dont defend myself i had no clear perception of what it was i really
wanted perhaps it was an impulse of unconscious loyalty or the
fulfillment of one of these ironic necessities that lurk in the facts of
human existence i dont know i cant tell but i went

i thought his memory was like the other memories of the dead that
accumulate in every mans lifea vague impress on the brain of shadows
that had fallen on it in their swift and final passage but before the
high and ponderous door between the tall houses of a street as still
and decorous as a wellkept alley in a cemetery i had a vision of him
on the stretcher opening his mouth voraciously as if to devour all the
earth with all its mankind he lived then before me he lived as much
as he had ever liveda shadow insatiable of splendid appearances of
frightful realities a shadow darker than the shadow of the night and
draped nobly in the folds of a gorgeous eloquence the vision seemed to
enter the house with methe stretcher the phantombearers the wild
crowd of obedient worshipers the gloom of the forests the glitter of
the reach between the murky bends the beat of the drum regular and
muffled like the beating of a heartthe heart of a conquering darkness
it was a moment of triumph for the wilderness an invading and vengeful
rush which it seemed to me i would have to keep back alone for the
salvation of another soul and the memory of what i had heard him say
afar there with the horned shapes stirring at my back in the glow of
fires within the patient woods those broken phrases came back to
me were heard again in their ominous and terrifying simplicity i
remembered his abject pleading his abject threats the colossal scale
of his vile desires the meanness the torment the tempestuous anguish
of his soul and later on i seemed to see his collected languid manner
when he said one day this lot of ivory now is really mine the company
did not pay for it i collected it myself at a very great personal risk
i am afraid they will try to claim it as theirs though hm it is a
difficult case what do you think i ought to doresist eh i want no
more than justice    he wanted no more than justiceno more than
justice i rang the bell before a mahogany door on the first floor and
while i waited he seemed to stare at me out of the glassy panelstare
with that wide and immense stare embracing condemning loathing all the
universe i seemed to hear the whispered cry the horror the horror

the dusk was falling i had to wait in a lofty drawingroom with three
long windows from floor to ceiling that were like three luminous and
bedraped columns the bent gilt legs and backs of the furniture shone in
indistinct curves the tall marble fireplace had a cold and monumental
whiteness a grand piano stood massively in a corner with dark gleams
on the flat surfaces like a somber and polished sarcophagus a high door
openedclosed i rose

she came forward all in black with a pale head floating towards
me in the dusk she was in mourning it was more than a year since his
death more than a year since the news came she seemed as though she
would remember and mourn for ever she took both my hands in hers and
murmured i had heard you were coming i noticed she was not very
youngi mean not girlish she had a mature capacity for fidelity for
belief for suffering the room seemed to have grown darker as if all
the sad light of the cloudy evening had taken refuge on her forehead
this fair hair this pale visage this pure brow seemed surrounded by
an ashy halo from which the dark eyes looked out at me their glance was
guileless profound confident and trustful she carried her sorrowful
head as though she were proud of that sorrow as though she would say
ii alone know how to mourn for him as he deserves but while we were
still shaking hands such a look of awful desolation came upon her
face that i perceived she was one of those creatures that are not the
playthings of time for her he had died only yesterday and by jove
the impression was so powerful that for me too he seemed to have died
only yesterdaynay this very minute i saw her and him in the same
instant of timehis death and her sorrowi saw her sorrow in the very
moment of his death do you understand i saw them togetheri heard
them together she had said with a deep catch of the breath i have
survived while my strained ears seemed to hear distinctly mingled
with her tone of despairing regret the summingup whisper of his
eternal condemnation i asked myself what i was doing there with a
sensation of panic in my heart as though i had blundered into a place
of cruel and absurd mysteries not fit for a human being to behold she
motioned me to a chair we sat down i laid the packet gently on the
little table and she put her hand over it    you knew him well
she murmured after a moment of mourning silence

intimacy grows quick out there i said i knew him as well as it is
possible for one man to know another

and you admired him she said it was impossible to know him and not
to admire him was it

he was a remarkable man i said unsteadily then before the
appealing fixity of her gaze that seemed to watch for more words on my
lips i went on it was impossible not to

love him she finished eagerly silencing me into an appalled
dumbness how true how true but when you think that no one knew him
so well as i i had all his noble confidence i knew him best

you knew him best i repeated and perhaps she did but with every
word spoken the room was growing darker and only her forehead smooth
and white remained illumined by the unextinguishable light of belief
and love

you were his friend she went on his friend she repeated a
little louder you must have been if he had given you this and sent
you to me i feel i can speak to youand oh i must speak i want
youyou who have heard his last wordsto know i have been worthy of
him    it is not pride    yes i am proud to know i understood
him better than anyone on earthhe told me so himself and since his
mother died i have had no oneno onetoto

i listened the darkness deepened i was not even sure whether he had
given me the right bundle i rather suspect he wanted me to take care
of another batch of his papers which after his death i saw the manager
examining under the lamp and the girl talked easing her pain in the
certitude of my sympathy she talked as thirsty men drink i had heard
that her engagement with kurtz had been disapproved by her people he
wasnt rich enough or something and indeed i dont know whether he had
not been a pauper all his life he had given me some reason to infer
that it was his impatience of comparative poverty that drove him out
there

   who was not his friend who had heard him speak once she was
saying he drew men towards him by what was best in them she looked
at me with intensity it is the gift of the great she went on and
the sound of her low voice seemed to have the accompaniment of all
the other sounds full of mystery desolation and sorrow i had ever
heardthe ripple of the river the soughing of the trees swayed by the
wind the murmurs of wild crowds the faint ring of incomprehensible
words cried from afar the whisper of a voice speaking from beyond the
threshold of an eternal darkness but you have heard him you know
she cried

yes i know i said with something like despair in my heart but
bowing my head before the faith that was in her before that great and
saving illusion that shone with an unearthly glow in the darkness in
the triumphant darkness from which i could not have defended herfrom
which i could not even defend myself

what a loss to meto usshe corrected herself with beautiful
generosity then added in a murmur to the world by the last gleams
of twilight i could see the glitter of her eyes full of tearsof tears
that would not fall

i have been very happyvery fortunatevery proud she went on too
fortunate too happy for a little while and now i am unhappy forfor
life

she stood up her fair hair seemed to catch all the remaining light in
a glimmer of gold i rose too

and of all this she went on mournfully of all his promise and
of all his greatness of his generous mind of his noble heart nothing
remainsnothing but a memory you and i

we shall always remember him i said hastily

no she cried it is impossible that all this should be lostthat
such a life should be sacrificed to leave nothingbut sorrow you
know what vast plans he had i knew of them tooi could not perhaps
understandbut others knew of them something must remain his words
at least have not died

his words will remain i said

and his example she whispered to herself men looked up to
himhis goodness shone in every act his example

true i said his example too yes his example i forgot that

but i do not i cannoti cannot believenot yet i cannot believe
that i shall never see him again that nobody will see him again never
never never

she put out her arms as if after a retreating figure stretching them
black and with clasped pale hands across the fading and narrow sheen of
the window never see him i saw him clearly enough then i shall see
this eloquent phantom as long as i live and i shall see her too a
tragic and familiar shade resembling in this gesture another one
tragic also and bedecked with powerless charms stretching bare brown
arms over the glitter of the infernal stream the stream of darkness
she said suddenly very low he died as he lived

his end said i with dull anger stirring in me was in every way
worthy of his life

and i was not with him she murmured my anger subsided before a
feeling of infinite pity

everything that could be done i mumbled

ah but i believed in him more than anyone on earthmore than his
own mother more thanhimself he needed me me i would have treasured
every sigh every word every sign every glance

i felt like a chill grip on my chest dont i said in a muffled
voice

forgive me iihave mourned so long in silencein silence
you were with himto the last i think of his loneliness nobody near
to understand him as i would have understood perhaps no one to
hear

to the very end i said shakily i heard his very last words
i stopped in a fright

repeat them she said in a heartbroken tone i wanti
wantsomethingsomethingtoto live with

i was on the point of crying at her dont you hear them the dusk
was repeating them in a persistent whisper all around us in a whisper
that seemed to swell menacingly like the first whisper of a rising wind
the horror the horror

his last wordto live with she murmured dont you understand i
loved himi loved himi loved him

i pulled myself together and spoke slowly

the last word he pronounced wasyour name

i heard a light sigh and then my heart stood still stopped dead short
by an exulting and terrible cry by the cry of inconceivable triumph and
of unspeakable pain i knew iti was sure    she knew she was
sure i heard her weeping she had hidden her face in her hands it
seemed to me that the house would collapse before i could escape that
the heavens would fall upon my head but nothing happened the heavens
do not fall for such a trifle would they have fallen i wonder if i
had rendered kurtz that justice which was his due hadnt he said he
wanted only justice but i couldnt i could not tell her it would have
been too darktoo dark altogether

marlow ceased and sat apart indistinct and silent in the pose of a
meditating buddha nobody moved for a time we have lost the first of
the ebb said the director suddenly i raised my head the offing was
barred by a black bank of clouds and the tranquil waterway leading
to the uttermost ends of the earth flowed somber under an overcast
skyseemed to lead into the heart of an immense darkness
