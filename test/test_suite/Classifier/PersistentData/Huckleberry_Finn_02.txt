look so wild in theeyes pretty soon he was all fagged out and fell down panting then herolled over and over wonderful fast kicking things every which wayand striking and grabbing at the air with his hands and screaming andsaying there was devils ahold of him  he wore out by and by and laidstill a while moaning  then he laid stiller and didnt make a sound i could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods and itseemed terrible still  he was laying over by the corner by and by heraised up part way and listened with his head to one side  he saysvery lowtramptramptramp thats the dead tramptramptramp theyre comingafter me but i wont go  oh theyre here dont touch medont handsofftheyre cold let go  oh let a poor devil alonethen he went down on all fours and crawled off begging them to let himalone and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under theold pine table still abegging and then he went to crying  i couldhear him through the blanketby and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild and hesee me and went for me  he chased me round and round the place with aclaspknife calling me the angel of death and saying he would kill meand then i couldnt come for him no more  i begged and told him iwas only huck but he laughed such a screechy laugh and roared andcussed and kept on chasing me up  once when i turned short anddodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between myshoulders and i thought i was gone but i slid out of the jacket quickas lightning and saved myself pretty soon he was all tired out anddropped down with his back against the door and said he would rest aminute and then kill me he put his knife under him and said he wouldsleep and get strong and then he would see who was whoso he dozed off pretty soon  by and by i got the old splitbottom chairand clumb up as easy as i could not to make any noise and got down thegun  i slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded then ilaid it across the turnip barrel pointing towards pap and set downbehind it to wait for him to stir  and how slow and still the time diddrag alonggit up  what you bouti opened my eyes and looked around trying to make out where i was  itwas after sunup and i had been sound asleep  pap was standing over melooking sour and sick too  he sayswhat you doin with this guni judged he didnt know nothing about what he had been doing so i sayssomebody tried to get in so i was laying for himwhy didnt you roust me outwell i tried to but i couldnt i couldnt budge youwell all right  dont stand there palavering all day but out withyou and see if theres a fish on the lines for breakfast  ill be alongin a minutehe unlocked the door and i cleared out up the riverbank  i noticedsome pieces of limbs and such things floating down and a sprinkling ofbark so i knowed the river had begun to rise  i reckoned i would havegreat times now if i was over at the town  the june rise used to bealways luck for me because as soon as that rise begins here comescordwood floating down and pieces of log raftssometimes a dozen logstogether so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to thewoodyards and the sawmilli went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and tother one outfor what the rise might fetch along  well all at once here comes acanoe just a beauty too about thirteen or fourteen foot long ridinghigh like a duck  i shot headfirst off of the bank like a frogclothes and all on and struck out for the canoe  i just expectedthered be somebody laying down in it because people often done thatto fool folks and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it theydraise up and laugh at him  but it warnt so this time  it was adriftcanoe sure enough and i clumb in and paddled her ashore  thinksi the old man will be glad when he sees thisshes worth ten dollars but when i got to shore pap wasnt in sight yet and as i was runningher into a little creek like a gully all hung over with vines andwillows i struck another idea  i judged id hide her good and thenstead of taking to the woods when i run off id go down the riverabout fifty mile and camp in one place for good and not have such arough time tramping on footit was pretty close to the shanty and i thought i heard the old mancoming all the time but i got her hid and then i out and looked arounda bunch of willows and there was the old man down the path a piece justdrawing a bead on a bird with his gun  so he hadnt seen anythingwhen he got along i was hard at it taking up a trot line  he abusedme a little for being so slow but i told him i fell in the river andthat was what made me so long  i knowed he would see i was wet andthen he would be asking questions  we got five catfish off the linesand went homewhile we laid off after breakfast to sleep up both of us being aboutwore out i got to thinking that if i could fix up some way to keep papand the widow from trying to follow me it would be a certainer thingthan trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me yousee all kinds of things might happen  well i didnt see no way for awhile but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel ofwater and he saysanother time a man comes aprowling round here you roust me out youhear that man warnt here for no good  id a shot him  next time youroust me out you hearthen he dropped down and went to sleep again but what he had beensaying give me the very idea i wanted  i says to myself i can fix itnow so nobody wont think of following meabout twelve oclock we turned out and went along up the bank  theriver was coming up pretty fast and lots of driftwood going by on therise by and by along comes part of a log raftnine logs fast together we went out with the skiff and towed it ashore  then we had dinneranybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through so as to catchmore stuff but that warnt paps style  nine logs was enough for onetime he must shove right over to town and sell  so he locked me in andtook the skiff and started off towing the raft about halfpast three i judged he wouldnt come back that night  i waited till i reckoned hehad got a good start then i out with my saw and went to work on thatlog again  before he was tother side of the river i was out of thehole him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonderi took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid andshoved the vines and branches apart and put it in then i done the samewith the side of bacon then the whiskyjug  i took all the coffee andsugar there was and all the ammunition i took the wadding i took thebucket and gourd i took a dipper and a tin cup and my old saw and twoblankets and the skillet and the coffeepot  i took fishlines andmatches and other thingseverything that was worth a cent  i cleanedout the place  i wanted an axe but there wasnt any only the one outat the woodpile and i knowed why i was going to leave that  i fetchedout the gun and now i was donei had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and draggingout so many things  so i fixed that as good as i could from the outsideby scattering dust on the place which covered up the smoothness and thesawdust  then i fixed the piece of log back into its place and put tworocks under it and one against it to hold it there for it was bent upat that place and didnt quite touch ground  if you stood four or fivefoot away and didnt know it was sawed you wouldnt never noticeit and besides this was the back of the cabin and it warnt likelyanybody would go fooling around thereit was all grass clear to the canoe so i hadnt left a track  ifollowed around to see  i stood on the bank and looked out over theriver  all safe  so i took the gun and went up a piece into the woodsand was hunting around for some birds when i see a wild pig hogs soonwent wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairiefarms i shot this fellow and took him into campi took the axe and smashed in the door  i beat it and hacked itconsiderable adoing it  i fetched the pig in and took him back nearlyto the table and hacked into his throat with the axe and laid him downon the ground to bleed i say ground because it was groundhard packedand no boards  well next i took an old sack and put a lot of big rocksin itall i could dragand i started it from the pig and dragged it tothe door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in anddown it sunk out of sight  you could easy see that something had beendragged over the ground  i did wish tom sawyer was there i knowed hewould take an interest in this kind of business and throw in the fancytouches  nobody could spread himself like tom sawyer in such a thing asthatwell last i pulled out some of my hair and blooded the axe good andstuck it on the back side and slung the axe in the corner  then itook up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket so he couldntdrip till i got a good piece below the house and then dumped him intothe river  now i thought of something else  so i went and got the bagof meal and my old saw out of the canoe and fetched them to the house i took the bag to where it used to stand and ripped a hole in thebottom of it with the saw for there warnt no knives and forks on theplacepap done everything with his claspknife about the cooking  theni carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and throughthe willows east of the house to a shallow lake that was five mile wideand full of rushesand ducks too you might say in the season  therewas a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that wentmiles away i dont know where but it didnt go to the river  the mealsifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake  i droppedpaps whetstone there too so as to look like it had been done byaccident then i tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string so itwouldnt leak no more and took it and my saw to the canoe againit was about dark now so i dropped the canoe down the river under somewillows that hung over the bank and waited for the moon to rise  imade fast to a willow then i took a bite to eat and by and by laiddown in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan  i says to myselftheyll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and thendrag the river for me  and theyll follow that meal track to the lakeand go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbersthat killed me and took the things  they wont ever hunt the river foranything but my dead carcass theyll soon get tired of that and wontbother no more about me  all right i can stop anywhere i want tojacksons island is good enough for me i know that island pretty welland nobody ever comes there  and then i can paddle over to town nightsand slink around and pick up things i want jacksons islands theplacei was pretty tired and the first thing i knowed i was asleep  wheni woke up i didnt know where i was for a minute  i set up and lookedaround a little scared  then i remembered  the river looked miles andmiles across  the moon was so bright i could a counted the drift logsthat went aslipping along black and still hundreds of yards out fromshore everything was dead quiet and it looked late and smelt lateyou know what i meani dont know the words to put it ini took a good gap and a stretch and was just going to unhitch and startwhen i heard a sound away over the water  i listened  pretty soon imade it out  it was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes fromoars working in rowlocks when its a still night  i peeped out throughthe willow branches and there it wasa skiff away across the water i couldnt tell how many was in it  it kept acoming and when it wasabreast of me i see there warnt but one man in it  thinks i maybeits pap though i warnt expecting him  he dropped below me with thecurrent and by and by he came aswinging up shore in the easy waterand he went by so close i could a reached out the gun and touched him well it was pap sure enoughand sober too by the way he laid hisoarsi didnt lose no time  the next minute i was aspinning down streamsoft but quick in the shade of the bank  i made two mile and a halfand then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle ofthe river because pretty soon i would be passing the ferry landing andpeople might see me and hail me  i got out amongst the driftwood andthen laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float i laid there and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe lookingaway into the sky not a cloud in it  the sky looks ever so deep whenyou lay down on your back in the moonshine i never knowed it before and how far a body can hear on the water such nights  i heard peopletalking at the ferry landing i heard what they said tooevery wordof it  one man said it was getting towards the long days and the shortnights now  tother one said this warnt one of the short ones hereckonedand then they laughed and he said it over again and theylaughed again then they waked up another fellow and told him andlaughed but he didnt laugh he ripped out something brisk and saidlet him alone  the first fellow said he lowed to tell it to hisold womanshe would think it was pretty good but he said that warntnothing to some things he had said in his time i heard one man say itwas nearly three oclock and he hoped daylight wouldnt wait more thanabout a week longer  after that the talk got further and further awayand i couldnt make out the words any more but i could hear the mumbleand now and then a laugh too but it seemed a long ways offi was away below the ferry now  i rose up and there was jacksonsisland about two mile and a half down stream heavy timbered andstanding up out of the middle of the river big and dark and solid likea steamboat without any lights  there warnt any signs of the bar atthe headit was all under water nowit didnt take me long to get there  i shot past the head at a rippingrate the current was so swift and then i got into the dead water andlanded on the side towards the illinois shore  i run the canoe intoa deep dent in the bank that i knowed about i had to part the willowbranches to get in and when i made fast nobody could a seen the canoefrom the outsidei went up and set down on a log at the head of the island and lookedout on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the townthree mile away where there was three or four lights twinkling  amonstrous big lumberraft was about a mile up stream coming along downwith a lantern in the middle of it  i watched it come creeping downand when it was most abreast of where i stood i heard a man say sternoars there heave her head to stabboard  i heard that just as plainas if the man was by my sidethere was a little gray in the sky now so i stepped into the woods andlaid down for a nap before breakfastthe sun was up so high when i waked that i judged it was after eightoclock  i laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking aboutthings and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied  icould see the sun out at one or two holes but mostly it was big treesall about and gloomy in there amongst them  there was freckled placeson the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves and thefreckled places swapped about a little showing there was a littlebreeze up there  a couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at mevery friendlyi was powerful lazy and comfortabledidnt want to get up and cookbreakfast  well i was dozing off again when i thinks i hears a deepsound of boom away up the river  i rouses up and rests on my elbowand listens pretty soon i hears it again  i hopped up and went andlooked out at a hole in the leaves and i see a bunch of smoke layingon the water a long ways upabout abreast the ferry  and there was theferryboat full of people floating along down  i knowed what was thematter now  boom i see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboatsside  you see they was firing cannon over the water trying to make mycarcass come to the topi was pretty hungry but it warnt going to do for me to start a firebecause they might see the smoke  so i set there and watched thecannonsmoke and listened to the boom  the river was a mile wide thereand it always looks pretty on a summer morningso i was having a goodenough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if i only had a bite toeat well then i happened to think how they always put quicksilver inloaves of bread and float them off because they always go right to thedrownded carcass and stop there  so says i ill keep a lookout andif any of thems floating around after me ill give them a show  ichanged to the illinois edge of the island to see what luck i couldhave and i warnt disappointed  a big double loaf come along and imost got it with a long stick but my foot slipped and she floated outfurther  of course i was where the current set in the closest to theshorei knowed enough for that  but by and by along comes another oneand this time i won  i took out the plug and shook out the little dabof quicksilver and set my teeth in  it was bakers breadwhat thequality eat none of your lowdown cornponei got a good place amongst the leaves and set there on a log munchingthe bread and watching the ferryboat and very well satisfied  andthen something struck me  i says now i reckon the widow or the parsonor somebody prayed that this bread would find me and here it has goneand done it  so there aint no doubt but there is something in thatthingthat is theres something in it when a body like the widow or theparson prays but it dont work for me and i reckon it dont work foronly just the right kindi lit a pipe and had a good long smoke and went on watching  theferryboat was floating with the current and i allowed id have a chanceto see who was aboard when she come along because she would come inclose where the bread did  when shed got pretty well along downtowards me i put out my pipe and went to where i fished out the breadand laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place  wherethe log forked i could peep throughby and by she come along and she drifted in so close that they coulda run out a plank and walked ashore  most everybody was on the boat pap and judge thatcher and bessie thatcher and jo harper and tomsawyer and his old aunt polly and sid and mary and plenty more everybody was talking about the murder but the captain broke in andsayslook sharp now the current sets in the closest here and maybe heswashed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the waters edge  ihope so anywayi didnt hope so  they all crowded up and leaned over the rails nearlyin my face and kept still watching with all their might  i could seethem firstrate but they couldnt see me  then the captain sung outstand away and the cannon let off such a blast right before me thatit made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke andi judged i was gone  if theyd a had some bullets in i reckon theyda got the corpse they was after  well i see i warnt hurt thanks togoodness the boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulderof the island  i could hear the booming now and then further andfurther off and by and by after an hour i didnt hear it no more the island was three mile long  i judged they had got to the foot andwas giving it up  but they didnt yet a while  they turned aroundthe foot of the island and started up the channel on the missouri sideunder steam and booming once in a while as they went  i crossed overto that side and watched them when they got abreast the head of theisland they quit shooting and dropped over to the missouri shore andwent home to the towni knowed i was all right now  nobody else would come ahunting afterme i got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thickwoods  i made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my thingsunder so the rain couldnt get at them  i catched a catfish and haggledhim open with my saw and towards sundown i started my camp fire and hadsupper  then i set out a line to catch some fish for breakfastwhen it was dark i set by my camp fire smoking and feeling pretty wellsatisfied but by and by it got sort of lonesome and so i went and seton the bank and listened to the current swashing along and counted thestars and drift logs and rafts that come down and then went to bedthere aint no better way to put in time when you are lonesome youcant stay so you soon get over itand so for three days and nights  no differencejust the same thingbut the next day i went exploring around down through the island  i wasboss of it it all belonged to me so to say and i wanted to knowall about it but mainly i wanted to put in the time  i found plentystrawberries ripe and prime and green summer grapes and greenrazberries and the green blackberries was just beginning to show  theywould all come handy by and by i judgedwell i went fooling along in the deep woods till i judged i warntfar from the foot of the island  i had my gun along but i hadnt shotnothing it was for protection thought i would kill some game nighhome about this time i mighty near stepped on a goodsized snakeand it went sliding off through the grass and flowers and i afterit trying to get a shot at it i clipped along and all of a sudden ibounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smokingmy heart jumped up amongst my lungs  i never waited for to lookfurther but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes asfast as ever i could  every now and then i stopped a second amongst thethick leaves and listened but my breath come so hard i couldnt hearnothing else  i slunk along another piece further then listened againand so on and so on  if i see a stump i took it for a man if i trodon a stick and broke it it made me feel like a person had cut one of mybreaths in two and i only got half and the short half toowhen i got to camp i warnt feeling very brash there warnt much sandin my craw but i says this aint no time to be fooling around  so igot all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sightand i put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like anold last years camp and then clumb a treei reckon i was up in the tree two hours but i didnt see nothingi didnt hear nothingi only thought i heard and seen as much as athousand things  well i couldnt stay up there forever so at last igot down but i kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all thetime all i could get to eat was berries and what was left over frombreakfastby the time it was night i was pretty hungry  so when it was goodand dark i slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to theillinois bankabout a quarter of a mile  i went out in the woods andcooked a supper and i had about made up my mind i would stay thereall night when i hear a plunketyplunk plunketyplunk and saysto myself horses coming and next i hear peoples voices  i goteverything into the canoe as quick as i could and then went creepingthrough the woods to see what i could find out  i hadnt got far when ihear a man saywe better camp here if we can find a good place the horses is aboutbeat out  lets look aroundi didnt wait but shoved out and paddled away easy  i tied up in theold place and reckoned i would sleep in the canoei didnt sleep much  i couldnt somehow for thinking  and every timei waked up i thought somebody had me by the neck  so the sleep didntdo me no good  by and by i says to myself i cant live this way imagoing to find out who it is thats here on the island with me illfind it out or bust  well i felt better right offso i took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two andthen let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows  the moon wasshining and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day i poked along well on to an hour everything still as rocks and soundasleep well by this time i was most down to the foot of the island  alittle ripply cool breeze begun to blow and that was as good as sayingthe night was about done  i give her a turn with the paddle and brungher nose to shore then i got my gun and slipped out and into the edgeof the woods  i sat down there on a log and looked out through theleaves  i see the moon go off watch and the darkness begin to blanketthe river but in a little while i see a pale streak over the treetopsand knowed the day was coming  so i took my gun and slipped off towardswhere i had run across that camp fire stopping every minute or twoto listen  but i hadnt no luck somehow i couldnt seem to find theplace  but by and by sure enough i catched a glimpse of fire awaythrough the trees  i went for it cautious and slow  by and by i wasclose enough to have a look and there laid a man on the ground  itmost give me the fantods he had a blanket around his head and hishead was nearly in the fire  i set there behind a clump of bushes inabout six foot of him and kept my eyes on him steady  it was gettinggray daylight now  pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hoveoff the blanket and it was miss watsons jim  i bet i was glad to seehim  i sayshello jim and skipped outhe bounced up and stared at me wild  then he drops down on his kneesand puts his hands together and saysdoan hurt medont  i haint ever done no harm to a ghos  i alwuzliked dead people en done all i could for em  you go en git in deriver

wisht i had de money i wouldn want no moi wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the islandthat id found when i was exploring so we started and soon got to itbecause the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a milewidethis place was a tolerable long steep hill or ridge about forty foothigh we had a rough time getting to the top the sides was so steep andthe bushes so thick  we tramped and clumb around all over it and byand by found a good big cavern in the rock most up to the top on theside towards illinois  the cavern was as big as two or three roomsbunched together and jim could stand up straight in it  it was cool inthere jim was for putting our traps in there right away but i said wedidnt want to be climbing up and down there all the timejim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place and had all the trapsin the cavern we could rush there if anybody was to come to the islandand they would never find us without dogs  and besides he said themlittle birds had said it was going to rain and did i want the things toget wetso we went back and got the canoe and paddled up abreast the cavernand lugged all the traps up there  then we hunted up a place close byto hide the canoe in amongst the thick willows  we took some fish offof the lines and set them again and begun to get ready for dinnerthe door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in and on oneside of the door the floor stuck out a little bit and was flat and agood place to build a fire on  so we built it there and cooked dinnerwe spread the blankets inside for a carpet and eat our dinner in therewe put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern  prettysoon it darkened up and begun to thunder and lighten so the birds wasright about it  directly it begun to rain and it rained like all furytoo and i never see the wind blow so  it was one of these regularsummer storms  it would get so dark that it looked all blueblackoutside and lovely and the rain would thrash along by so thick thatthe trees off a little ways looked dim and spiderwebby and here wouldcome a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up thepale underside of the leaves and then a perfect ripper of a gust wouldfollow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if theywas just wild and next when it was just about the bluest andblackestfst it was as bright as glory and youd have a littleglimpse of treetops aplunging about away off yonder in the stormhundreds of yards further than you could see before dark as sin againin a second and now youd hear the thunder let go with an awful crashand then go rumbling grumbling tumbling down the sky towards theunder side of the world like rolling empty barrels down stairswhereits long stairs and they bounce a good deal you knowjim this is nice i says  i wouldnt want to be nowhere else buthere pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot cornbreadwell you wouldnt a ben here f it hadnt a ben for jim  youd a bendown dah in de woods widout any dinner en gittn mos drownded toodat you would honey  chickens knows when its gwyne to rain en so dode birds chilethe river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days till atlast it was over the banks  the water was three or four foot deep onthe island in the low places and on the illinois bottom  on that sideit was a good many miles wide but on the missouri side it was the sameold distance acrossa half a milebecause the missouri shore was just awall of high bluffsdaytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe it was mighty cooland shady in the deep woods even if the sun was blazing outside  wewent winding in and out amongst the trees and sometimes the vines hungso thick we had to back away and go some other way  well on every oldbrokendown tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things andwhen the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame onaccount of being hungry that you could paddle right up and put yourhand on them if you wanted to but not the snakes and turtlesthey wouldslide off in the water  the ridge our cavern was in was full of themwe could a had pets enough if wed wanted themone night we catched a little section of a lumber raftnice pine planksit was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long andthe top stood above water six or seven inchesa solid level floor  wecould see sawlogs go by in the daylight sometimes but we let them gowe didnt show ourselves in daylightanother night when we was up at the head of the island just beforedaylight here comes a framehouse down on the west side  she wasa twostory and tilted over considerable  we paddled out and gotaboardclumb in at an upstairs window  but it was too dark to see yetso we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylightthe light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island  thenwe looked in at the window  we could make out a bed and a table andtwo old chairs and lots of things around about on the floor and therewas clothes hanging against the wall  there was something laying on thefloor in the far corner that looked like a man  so jim sayshello youbut it didnt budge  so i hollered again and then jim saysde man aint asleephes dead  you hold stillill go en seehe went and bent down and looked and saysits a dead man  yes indeedy naked too  hes ben shot in de backi reckn hes ben dead two er three days  come in huck but doan lookat his faceits too gashlyi didnt look at him at all  jim throwed some old rags over him buthe neednt done it i didnt want to see him  there was heaps of oldgreasy cards scattered around over the floor and old whisky bottlesand a couple of masks made out of black cloth and all over the wallswas the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal there was two old dirty calico dresses and a sunbonnet and somewomens underclothes hanging against the wall and some mens clothingtoo  we put the lot into the canoeit might come good  there was aboys old speckled straw hat on the floor i took that too  and therewas a bottle that had had milk in it and it had a rag stopper for ababy to suck  we would a took the bottle but it was broke  there wasa seedy old chest and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke  theystood open but there warnt nothing left in them that was any account the way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in ahurry and warnt fixed so as to carry off most of their stuffwe got an old tin lantern and a butcherknife without any handle anda brannew barlow knife worth two bits in any store and a lot of tallowcandles and a tin candlestick and a gourd and a tin cup and a rattyold bedquilt off the bed and a reticule with needles and pins andbeeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it and a hatchetand some nails and a fishline as thick as my little finger with somemonstrous hooks on it and a roll of buckskin and a leather dogcollarand a horseshoe and some vials of medicine that didnt have no labelon them and just as we was leaving i found a tolerable good currycomband jim he found a ratty old fiddlebow and a wooden leg  the strapswas broke off of it but barring that it was a good enough leg thoughit was too long for me and not long enough for jim and we couldnt findthe other one though we hunted all aroundand so take it all around we made a good haul  when we was ready toshove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island and it was prettybroad day so i made jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with thequilt because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a goodways off  i paddled over to the illinois shore and drifted down mosta half a mile doing it  i crept up the dead water under the bank andhadnt no accidents and didnt see nobody  we got home all safeafter breakfast i wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how hecome to be killed but jim didnt want to  he said it would fetch badluck and besides he said he might come and hant us he said a manthat warnt buried was more likely to go ahanting around than onethat was planted and comfortable  that sounded pretty reasonable soi didnt say no more but i couldnt keep from studying over it andwishing i knowed who shot the man and what they done it forwe rummaged the clothes wed got and found eight dollars in silversewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat  jim said he reckonedthe people in that house stole the coat because if theyd a knowed themoney was there they wouldnt a left it  i said i reckoned they killedhim too but jim didnt want to talk about that  i saysnow you think its bad luck but what did you say when i fetched in thesnakeskin that i found on the top of the ridge day before yesterdayyou said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snakeskinwith my hands  well heres your bad luck  weve raked in all thistruck and eight dollars besides  i wish we could have some bad lucklike this every day jimnever you mind honey never you mind  dont you git too peart  itsacomin  mind i tell you its acominit did come too  it was a tuesday that we had that talk  well afterdinner friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of theridge and got out of tobacco  i went to the cavern to get some andfound a rattlesnake in there  i killed him and curled him up on thefoot of jims blanket ever so natural thinking thered be some funwhen jim found him there  well by night i forgot all about the snakeand when jim flung himself down on the blanket while i struck a lightthe snakes mate was there and bit himhe jumped up yelling and the first thing the light showed was thevarmint curled up and ready for another spring  i laid him out in asecond with a stick and jim grabbed paps whiskyjug and begun to pourit downhe was barefooted and the snake bit him right on the heel  that allcomes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leavea dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it  jim toldme to chop off the snakes head and throw it away and then skin thebody and roast a piece of it  i done it and he eat it and said itwould help cure him he made me take off the rattles and tie them aroundhis wrist too  he said that that would help  then i slid out quietand throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes for i warnt goingto let jim find out it was all my fault not if i could help itjim sucked and sucked at the jug and now and then he got out of hishead and pitched around and yelled but every time he come to himself hewent to sucking at the jug again  his foot swelled up pretty big andso did his leg but by and by the drunk begun to come and so i judgedhe was all right but id druther been bit with a snake than papswhiskyjim was laid up for four days and nights  then the swelling was allgone and he was around again  i made up my mind i wouldnt ever takeaholt of a snakeskin again with my hands now that i see what had comeof it jim said he reckoned i would believe him next time  and he saidthat handling a snakeskin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadntgot to the end of it yet  he said he druther see the new moon over hisleft shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snakeskinin his hand  well i was getting to feel that way myself though ivealways reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder isone of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do  old hankbunker done it once and bragged about it and in less than two years hegot drunk and fell off of the shottower and spread himself out sothat he was just a kind of a layer as you may say and they slid himedgeways between two barn doors for a coffin and buried him so sothey say but i didnt see it  pap told me  but anyway it all come oflooking at the moon that way like a foolwell the days went along and the river went down between its banksagain and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the bighooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that wasas big as a man being six foot two inches long and weighed over twohundred pounds we couldnt handle him of course he would a flung usinto illinois  we just set there and watched him rip and tear aroundtill he drownded  we found a brass button in his stomach and a roundball and lots of rubbage  we split the ball open with the hatchetand there was a spool in it  jim said hed had it there a long time tocoat it over so and make a ball of it  it was as big a fish as was evercatched in the mississippi i reckon  jim said he hadnt ever seena bigger one  he would a been worth a good deal over at the village they peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the markethousethere everybody buys some of him his meats as white as snow and makesa good frynext morning i said it was getting slow and dull and i wanted to get astirring up some way  i said i reckoned i would slip over the river andfind out what was going on  jim liked that notion but he said imust go in the dark and look sharp  then he studied it over and saidcouldnt i put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl that was a good notion too  so we shortened up one of the calicogowns and i turned up my trouserlegs to my knees and got into it  jimhitched it behind with the hooks and it was a fair fit  i put on thesunbonnet and tied it under my chin and then for a body to look inand see my face was like looking down a joint of stovepipe  jim saidnobody would know me even in the daytime hardly  i practiced aroundall day to get the hang of the things and by and by i could do prettywell in them only jim said i didnt walk like a girl and he saidi must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britchespocket  i tooknotice and done betteri started up the illinois shore in the canoe just after darki started across to the town from a little below the ferrylanding andthe drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town  itied up and started along the bank  there was a light burning in alittle shanty that hadnt been lived in for a long time and i wonderedwho had took up quarters there  i slipped up and peeped in at thewindow  there was a woman about forty year old in there knitting bya candle that was on a pine table  i didnt know her face she was astranger for you couldnt start a face in that town that i didnt know now this was lucky because i was weakening i was getting afraid i hadcome people might know my voice and find me out  but if this woman hadbeen in such a little town two days she could tell me all i wanted toknow so i knocked at the door and made up my mind i wouldnt forget iwas a girlcome in says the woman and i did  she says  take a cheeri done it  she looked me all over with her little shiny eyes and sayswhat might your name besarah williamswhere bouts do you live  in this neighborhoodnom  in hookerville seven mile below  ive walked all the way andim all tired outhungry too i reckon  ill find you somethingnom i aint hungry  i was so hungry i had to stop two miles belowhere at a farm so i aint hungry no more  its what makes me so latemy mothers down sick and out of money and everything and i come totell my uncle abner moore  he lives at the upper end of the town shesays  i haint ever been here before  do you know himno but i dont know everybody yet  i havent lived here quite twoweeks its a considerable ways to the upper end of the town  youbetter stay here all night  take off your bonnetno i says ill rest a while i reckon and go on  i aint afearedof the darkshe said she wouldnt let me go by myself but her husband would be inby and by maybe in a hour and a half and shed send him along with methen she got to talking about her husband and about her relations upthe river and her relations down the river and about how much betteroff they used to was and how they didnt know but theyd made a mistakecoming to our town instead of letting well aloneand so on and so ontill i was afeard i had made a mistake coming to her to find out whatwas going on in the town but by
