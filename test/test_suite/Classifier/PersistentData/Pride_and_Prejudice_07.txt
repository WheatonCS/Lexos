would be well attended to and inthe clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the moregentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heardhad elizabeths opinion been all drawn from her own family she couldnot have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domesticcomfort her father captivated by youth and beauty and that appearanceof good humour which youth and beauty generally give had married awoman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early intheir marriage put an end to all real affection for her respectesteem and confidence had vanished for ever and all his viewsof domestic happiness were overthrown but mr bennet was not ofa disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his ownimprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too oftenconsole the unfortunate for their folly or their vice he was fond ofthe country and of books and from these tastes had arisen his principalenjoyments to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than asher ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement this is notthe sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to hiswife but where other powers of entertainment are wanting the truephilosopher will derive benefit from such as are givenelizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of herfathers behaviour as a husband she had always seen it with pain butrespecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment ofherself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and tobanish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligationand decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her ownchildren was so highly reprehensible but she had never felt sostrongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of sounsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arisingfrom so illjudged a direction of talents talents which rightly usedmight at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters evenif incapable of enlarging the mind of his wifewhen elizabeth had rejoiced over wickhams departure she found littleother cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment their partiesabroad were less varied than before and at home she had a mother andsister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything aroundthem threw a real gloom over their domestic circle and though kittymight in time regain her natural degree of sense since the disturbersof her brain were removed her other sister from whose dispositiongreater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in allher folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as awateringplace and a camp upon the whole therefore she found whathas been sometimes found before that an event to which she had beenlooking with impatient desire did not in taking place bring all thesatisfaction she had promised herself it was consequently necessary toname some other period for the commencement of actual felicityto havesome other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed and byagain enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for thepresent and prepare for another disappointment her tour to the lakeswas now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolationfor all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her motherand kitty made inevitable and could she have included jane in thescheme every part of it would have been perfectbut it is fortunate thought she that i have something to wish forwere the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certainbut here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in mysisters absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations ofpleasure realised a scheme of which every part promises delight cannever be successful and general disappointment is only warded off bythe defence of some little peculiar vexationwhen lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutelyto her mother and kitty but her letters were always long expected andalways very short those to her mother contained little else than thatthey were just returned from the library where such and such officershad attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments asmade her quite wild that she had a new gown or a new parasol whichshe would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in aviolent hurry as mrs forster called her and they were going off tothe camp and from her correspondence with her sister there was stillless to be learntfor her letters to kitty though rather longer weremuch too full of lines under the words to be made publicafter the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health goodhumour and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn everything worea happier aspect the families who had been in town for the winter cameback again and summer finery and summer engagements arose mrs bennetwas restored to her usual querulous serenity and by the middle ofjune kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton withouttears an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that bythe following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not tomention an officer above once a day unless by some cruel and maliciousarrangement at the war office another regiment should be quartered inmerytonthe time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fastapproaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letterarrived from mrs gardiner which at once delayed its commencement andcurtailed its extent mr gardiner would be prevented by business fromsetting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london againwithin a month and as that left too short a period for them to go sofar and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it withthe leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give upthe lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to thepresent plan were to go no farther northwards than derbyshire in thatcounty there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their threeweeks and to mrs gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction thetown where she had formerly passed some years of her life and wherethey were now to spend a few days was probably as great an object ofher curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock chatsworthdovedale or the peakelizabeth was excessively disappointed she had set her heart on seeingthe lakes and still thought there might have been time enough but itwas her business to be satisfiedand certainly her temper to be happyand all was soon right againwith the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected it wasimpossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and itsowner but surely said she i may enter his county with impunityand rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving methe period of expectation was now doubled four weeks were to pass awaybefore her uncle and aunts arrival but they did pass away and mrand mrs gardiner with their four children did at length appear atlongbourn the children two girls of six and eight years old and twoyounger boys were to be left under the particular care of theircousin jane who was the general favourite and whose steady sense andsweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in everywayteaching them playing with them and loving themthe gardiners stayed only one night at longbourn and set off thenext morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusementone enjoyment was certainthat of suitableness of companionsa suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bearinconveniencescheerfulness to enhance every pleasureand affectionand intelligence which might supply it among themselves if there weredisappointments abroadit is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshirenor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thitherlay oxford blenheim warwick kenilworth birmingham etc aresufficiently known a small part of derbyshire is all the presentconcern to the little town of lambton the scene of mrs gardinersformer residence and where she had lately learned some acquaintancestill remained they bent their steps after having seen all theprincipal wonders of the country and within five miles of lambtonelizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated it was notin their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it intalking over their route the evening before mrs gardiner expressedan inclination to see the place again mr gardiner declared hiswillingness and elizabeth was applied to for her approbationmy love should not you like to see a place of which you have heardso much said her aunt a place too with which so many of youracquaintances are connected wickham passed all his youth there youknowelizabeth was distressed she felt that she had no business atpemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it shemust own that she was tired of seeing great houses after going over somany she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtainsmrs gardiner abused her stupidity if it were merely a fine houserichly furnished said she i should not care about it myself butthe grounds are delightful they have some of the finest woods in thecountryelizabeth said no morebut her mind could not acquiesce thepossibility of meeting mr darcy while viewing the place instantlyoccurred it would be dreadful she blushed at the very idea andthought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run sucha risk but against this there were objections and she finally resolvedthat it could be the last resource if her private inquiries to theabsence of the family were unfavourably answeredaccordingly when she retired at night she asked the chambermaidwhether pemberley were not a very fine place what was the name of itsproprietor and with no little alarm whether the family were down forthe summer a most welcome negative followed the last questionand heralarms now being removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal ofcuriosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived thenext morning and she was again applied to could readily answer andwith a proper air of indifference that she had not really any disliketo the scheme to pemberley therefore they were to goelizabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance ofpemberley woods with some perturbation and when at length they turnedin at the lodge her spirits were in a high flutterthe park was very large and contained great variety of ground theyentered it in one of its lowest points and drove for some time througha beautiful wood stretching over a wide extentelizabeths mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admiredevery remarkable spot and point of view they gradually ascended forhalfamile and then found themselves at the top of a considerableeminence where the wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught bypemberley house situated on the opposite side of a valley into whichthe road with some abruptness wound it was a large handsome stonebuilding standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge ofhigh woody hills and in front a stream of some natural importance wasswelled into greater but without any artificial appearance its bankswere neither formal nor falsely adorned elizabeth was delighted shehad never seen a place for which nature had done more or where naturalbeauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste they wereall of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt thatto be mistress of pemberley might be somethingthey descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door andwhile examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehension ofmeeting its owner returned she dreaded lest the chambermaid had beenmistaken on applying to see the place they were admitted into thehall and elizabeth as they waited for the housekeeper had leisure towonder at her being where she wasthe housekeeper came a respectablelooking elderly woman much lessfine and more civil than she had any notion of finding her theyfollowed her into the diningparlour it was a large well proportionedroom handsomely fitted up elizabeth after slightly surveying it wentto a window to enjoy its prospect the hill crowned with wood whichthey had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distancewas a beautiful object every disposition of the ground was good andshe looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on itsbanks and the winding of the valley as far as she could trace itwith delight as they passed into other rooms these objects were takingdifferent positions but from every window there were beauties to beseen the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable tothe fortune of its proprietor but elizabeth saw with admiration ofhis taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine with less ofsplendour and more real elegance than the furniture of rosingsand of this place thought she i might have been mistress withthese rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted instead ofviewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own andwelcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt but norecollectingherselfthat could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost tome i should not have been allowed to invite themthis was a lucky recollectionit saved her from something very likeregretshe longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was reallyabsent but had not the courage for it at length however the questionwas asked by her uncle and she turned away with alarm while mrsreynolds replied that he was adding but we expect him tomorrow witha large party of friends how rejoiced was elizabeth that their ownjourney had not by any circumstance been delayed a dayher aunt now called her to look at a picture she approached and saw thelikeness of mr wickham suspended amongst several other miniaturesover the mantelpiece her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked itthe housekeeper came forward and told them it was a picture of a younggentleman the son of her late masters steward who had been broughtup by him at his own expense he is now gone into the army she addedbut i am afraid he has turned out very wildmrs gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but elizabeth could notreturn itand that said mrs reynolds pointing to another of the miniaturesis my masterand very like him it was drawn at the same time as theotherabout eight years agoi have heard much of your masters fine person said mrs gardinerlooking at the picture it is a handsome face but lizzy you can tellus whether it is like or notmrs reynolds respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on thisintimation of her knowing her masterdoes that young lady know mr darcyelizabeth coloured and said a littleand do not you think him a very handsome gentleman maamyes very handsomei am sure i know none so handsome but in the gallery up stairs youwill see a finer larger picture of him than this this room was my latemasters favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used tobe then he was very fond of themthis accounted to elizabeth for mr wickhams being among themmrs reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy drawnwhen she was only eight years oldand is miss darcy as handsome as her brother said mrs gardineroh yesthe handsomest young lady that ever was seen and soaccomplishedshe plays and sings all day long in the next room isa new instrument just come down for hera present from my master shecomes here tomorrow with himmr gardiner whose manners were very easy and pleasant encouraged hercommunicativeness by his questions and remarks mrs reynolds eitherby pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of hermaster and his sisteris your master much at pemberley in the course of the yearnot so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half histime here and miss darcy is always down for the summer monthsexcept thought elizabeth when she goes to ramsgateif your master would marry you might see more of himyes sir but i do not know when that will be i do not know who isgood enough for himmr and mrs gardiner smiled elizabeth could not help saying it isvery much to his credit i am sure that you should think soi say no more than the truth and everybody will say that knows him replied the other elizabeth thought this was going pretty far and shelistened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added i havenever known a cross word from him in my life and i have known him eversince he was four years oldthis was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to herideas that he was not a goodtempered man had been her firmest opinionher keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more and wasgrateful to her uncle for sayingthere are very few people of whom so much can be said you are lucky inhaving such a masteryes sir i know i am if i were to go through the world i couldnot meet with a better but i have always observed that they who aregoodnatured when children are goodnatured when they grow up andhe was always the sweetesttempered most generoushearted boy in theworldelizabeth almost stared at her can this be mr darcy thought shehis father was an excellent man said mrs gardineryes maam that he was indeed and his son will be just like himjustas affable to the poorelizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more mrsreynolds could interest her on no other point she related the subjectsof the pictures the dimensions of the rooms and the price of thefurniture in vain mr gardiner highly amused by the kind of familyprejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of hermaster soon led again to the subject and she dwelt with energy on hismany merits as they proceeded together up the great staircasehe is the best landlord and the best master said she that everlived not like the wild young men nowadays who think of nothing butthemselves there is not one of his tenants or servants but will givehim a good name some people call him proud but i am sure i never sawanything of it to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle awaylike other young menin what an amiable light does this place him thought elizabeththis fine account of him whispered her aunt as they walked is notquite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friendperhaps we might be deceivedthat is not very likely our authority was too goodon reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very prettysittingroom lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness thanthe apartments below and were informed that it was but just done togive pleasure to miss darcy who had taken a liking to the room whenlast at pemberleyhe is certainly a good brother said elizabeth as she walked towardsone of the windowsmrs reynolds anticipated miss darcys delight when she should enterthe room and this is always the way with him she added whatevercan give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment thereis nothing he would not do for herthe picturegallery and two or three of the principal bedrooms wereall that remained to be shown in the former were many good paintingsbut elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been alreadyvisible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of missdarcys in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting andalso more intelligiblein the gallery there were many family portraits but they could havelittle to fix the attention of a stranger elizabeth walked in quest ofthe only face whose features would be known to her at last it arrestedherand she beheld a striking resemblance to mr darcy with such asmile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when helooked at her she stood several minutes before the picture in earnestcontemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallerymrs reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his fatherslifetimethere was certainly at this moment in elizabeths mind a more gentlesensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height oftheir acquaintance the commendation bestowed on him by mrs reynoldswas of no trifling nature what praise is more valuable than the praiseof an intelligent servant as a brother a landlord a master sheconsidered how many peoples happiness were in his guardianshiphowmuch of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestowhow much ofgood or evil must be done by him every idea that had been broughtforward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as shestood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed hiseyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment ofgratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth andsoftened its impropriety of expressionwhen all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seenthey returned downstairs and taking leave of the housekeeper wereconsigned over to the gardener who met them at the halldooras they walked across the hall towards the river elizabeth turned backto look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the formerwas conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himselfsuddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stablesthey were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was hisappearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight their eyesinstantly met and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepestblush he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immovable fromsurprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the partyand spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at leastof perfect civilityshe had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approachreceived his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to beovercome had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picturethey had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other twothat they now saw mr darcy the gardeners expression of surprise onbeholding his master must immediately have told it they stood a littlealoof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confusedscarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answershe returned to his civil inquiries after her family amazed at thealteration of his manner since they last parted every sentence thathe uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of theimpropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the fewminutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable inher life nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accenthad none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his inquiries asto the time of her having left longbourn and of her having stayed inderbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke thedistraction of his thoughtsat length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a fewmoments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and tookleavethe others then joined her and expressed admiration of his figure butelizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelingsfollowed them in silence she was overpowered by shame and vexation hercoming there was the most unfortunate the most illjudged thing in theworld how strange it must appear to him in what a disgraceful lightmight it not strike so vain a man it might seem as if she had purposelythrown herself in his way again oh why did she come or why did hethus come a day before he was expected had they been only ten minutessooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discriminationfor it was plain that he was that moment arrivedthat moment alightedfrom his horse or his carriage she blushed again and again overthe perverseness of the meeting and his behaviour so strikinglyalteredwhat could it mean that he should even speak to her wasamazingbut to speak with such civility to inquire after her familynever in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified neverhad he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting whata contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park when he puthis letter into her hand she knew not what to think or how to accountfor itthey had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water andevery step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finerreach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some timebefore elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answeredmechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt andseemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out shedistinguished no part of the scene her thoughts were all fixed on thatone spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where mr darcy thenwas she longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mindinwhat manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of everythingshe was still dear to him perhaps he had been civil only because hefelt himself at ease yet there had been that in his voice which wasnot like ease whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure inseeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her withcomposureat length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mindaroused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herselfthey entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a whileascended some of the higher grounds when in spots where the opening ofthe trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of thevalley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreadingmany and occasionally part of the stream mr gardiner expressed a wishof going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walkwith a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles roundit settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit whichbrought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woodsto the edge of the water and one of its narrowest parts they crossedit by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the sceneit was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and thevalley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the streamand a narrow walk amidst the rough coppicewood which bordered itelizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed thebridge and perceived their distance from the house mrs gardinerwho was not a great walker could go no farther and thought onlyof returning to the carriage as quickly as possible her niece wastherefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the houseon the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but theirprogress was slow for mr gardiner though seldom able to indulge thetaste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching theoccasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to theman about them that he advanced but little whilst wandering on in thisslow manner they were again surprised and elizabeths astonishmentwas quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr darcyapproaching them and at no great distance the walk being hereless sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him beforethey met elizabeth however astonished was at least more preparedfor an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak withcalmness if he really intended to meet them for a few moments indeedshe felt that he would probably strike into some other path the idealasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view theturning past he was immediately before them with a glance she sawthat he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate hispoliteness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the placebut she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming whensome unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise ofpemberley from her might be mischievously construed her colour changedand she said no moremrs gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he askedher if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friendsthis was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unpreparedand she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking theacquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride hadrevolted in his offer to herself what will be his surprise thoughtshe when he knows who they are he takes them now for people offashionthe introduction however was immediately made and as she named theirrelationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he boreit and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as hecould from such disgraceful companions that he was surprised by theconnection was evident he sustained it however with fortitude andso far from going away turned back with them and entered intoconversation with mr gardiner elizabeth could not but be pleasedcould not but triumph it was consoling that he should know she hadsome relations for whom there was no need to blush she listened mostattentively to all that passed between them and gloried in everyexpression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligencehis taste or his good mannersthe conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard mr darcyinvite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as hechose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same timeto supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts ofthe stream where there was usually most sport mrs gardiner who waswalking arminarm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of wonderelizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the complimentmust be all for herself her astonishment however was extreme andcontinually was she repeating why is he so altered from what canit proceed it cannot be for meit cannot be for my sake that hismanners are thus softened my reproofs at hunsford could not work such achange as this it is impossible that he should still love meafter walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the twogentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending tothe brink of the river for the better inspection of some curiouswaterplant there chanced to be a little alteration it originatedin mrs gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning foundelizabeths arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferredher husbands mr darcy took her place by her niece and they walked ontogether after a short silence the lady first spoke she wished himto know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to theplace and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had beenvery unexpectedfor your housekeeper she added informed us thatyou would certainly not be here till tomorrow and indeed before weleft bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expectedin the country he acknowledged the truth of it all and said thatbusiness with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hoursbefore the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling theywill join me early tomorrow he continued and among them are somewho will claim an acquaintance with youmr bingley and his sisterselizabeth answered only by a slight bow her thoughts were instantlydriven back to the time when mr bingleys name had been the lastmentioned between them and if she might judge by his complexion hismind was not very differently engagedthere is also one other person in the party he continued after apause who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allowme or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintanceduring your stay at lambtonthe surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too greatfor her to know in what manner she acceded to it she immediately feltthat whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with hermust be the work of her brother and without looking farther it wassatisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not madehim think really ill of herthey now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought elizabethwas not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered andpleased his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment ofthe highest kind they soon outstripped the others and when they hadreached the carriage mr and mrs gardiner were half a quarter of amile behindhe then asked her to walk into the housebut she declared herself nottired and they stood together on the lawn at such a time much mighthave been said and silence was very awkward she wanted to talk butthere seemed to be an embargo on every subject at last she recollectedthat she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dalewith great perseverance yet time and her aunt moved slowlyand herpatience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the teteatete wasover on mr and mrs gardiners coming up they were all pressed to gointo the house and take some refreshment but this was declined andthey parted on each side with utmost politeness mr darcy handed theladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw himwalking slowly towards the housethe observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of thempronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expectedhe is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her unclethere is something a little stately in him to be sure replied heraunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming i can nowsay with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud ihave seen nothing of iti was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us it was morethan civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for suchattention his acquaintance with elizabeth was very triflingto be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as wickhamor rather he has not wickhams countenance for his featuresare perfectly good but how came you to tell me that he was sodisagreeableelizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had likedhim better when they had met in kent than before and that she had neverseen him so pleasant as this morningbut perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities repliedher uncle your great men often are and therefore i shall not take himat his word as he might change his mind another day and warn me offhis groundselizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character butsaid nothingfrom what we have seen of him continued mrs gardiner i reallyshould not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way byanybody as he has done by poor wickham he has not an illnatured lookon the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when hespeaks and there is something of dignity in his countenance that wouldnot give one an unfavourable idea of his heart but to be sure thegood lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming characteri could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes but he is a liberalmaster i suppose and that in the eye of a servant comprehends everyvirtueelizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication ofhis behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand inas guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard fromhis relations in kent his actions were capable of a very differentconstruction and that his character was by no means so faulty norwickhams so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire inconfirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniarytransactions in which they had been connected without actually namingher authority but stating it to be such as might be relied onmrs gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were nowapproaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way tothe charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing outto her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think ofanything else fatigued as she had been by the mornings walk theyhad no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her formeracquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of aintercourse renewed after many years discontinuancethe occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabethmuch attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothingbut think and think with wonder of mr darcys civility and aboveall of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sisterelizabeth had settled it that mr darcy would bring his sister to visither the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequentlyresolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morningbut her conclusion was false for on the very morning after theirarrival at lambton these visitors came they had been walking about theplace with some of their new friends and were just returning to the innto dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of acarriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and a lady ina curricle driving up the street elizabeth immediately recognizingthe livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of hersurprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which sheexpected her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassmentof her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and manyof the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea onthe business nothing had ever suggested it before but they felt thatthere was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such aquarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece while thesenewlyborn notions were passing in their heads the perturbation ofelizabeths feelings was at every moment increasing she was quiteamazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of disquietshe dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too muchin her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturallysuspected that every power of pleasing would fail hershe retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walkedup and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks ofinquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worsemiss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introductiontook place with astonishment did elizabeth see that her newacquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself since herbeing at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proudbut the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she wasonly exceedingly shy she found it difficult to obtain even a word fromher beyond a monosyllablemiss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and thoughlittle more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearancewomanly and graceful she was less handsome than her brother but therewas sense and good humour in her face and her manners were perfectlyunassuming and gentle elizabeth who had expected to find in her asacute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr darcy had been was muchrelieved by discerning such different feelingsthey had not long been together before mr darcy told her that bingleywas also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express hersatisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingleys quickstep was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room allelizabeths anger against him had been long done away but had she stillfelt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffectedcordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again heinquired in a friendly though general way after her family and lookedand spoke with the same goodhumoured ease that he had ever doneto mr and mrs gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personagethan to herself they had long wished to see him the whole party beforethem indeed excited a lively attention the suspicions which had justarisen of mr darcy and their niece directed their observation towardseach with an earnest though guarded inquiry and they soon drew fromthose inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knewwhat it was to love of the ladys sensations they remained a littlein doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration wasevident enoughelizabeth on her side had much to do she wanted to ascertain thefeelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own andto make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where shefeared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom sheendeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour bingleywas ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleasedin seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and ohhow ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed ina like manner sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than onformer occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notionthat as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance butthough this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to hisbehaviour to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival to jane no lookappeared on either side that spoke particular regard nothing occurredbetween them that could justify the hopes of his sister on this pointshe was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurredere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted arecollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of sayingmore that might lead to the mention of her had he dared he observedto her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tonewhich had something of real regret that it was a very long time sincehe had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could replyhe added it is above eight months we have not met since the th ofnovember when we were all dancing together at netherfieldelizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwardstook occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whetherall her sisters were at longbourn there was not much in the questionnor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner whichgave them meaningit was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr darcy himselfbut whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of generalcomplaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so removedfrom hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her thatthe improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed howevertemporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day whenshe saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinionof people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been adisgracewhen she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to thevery relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their lastlively scene in hunsford parsonagethe difference the change wasso great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardlyrestrain her astonishment from being visible never even in the companyof his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relationsat rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free fromselfconsequence or unbending reserve as now when no importancecould result from the success of his endeavours and when even theacquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would drawdown the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield androsingstheir visitors stayed with them above halfanhour and when they aroseto depart mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressingtheir wish of seeing mr and mrs gardiner and miss bennet to dinnerat pemberley before they left the country miss darcy though with adiffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitationsreadily obeyed mrs gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowinghow she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to itsacceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head presuming howeverthat this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment thanany dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond ofsociety a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage forher attendance and the day after the next was fixed onbingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabethagain having still a great deal to say to her and many inquiries tomake after all their hertfordshire friends elizabeth construing allthis into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and onthis account as well as some others found herself when theirvisitors left them capable of considering the last halfhour with somesatisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had beenlittle eager to be alone and fearful of inquiries or hints from heruncle and aunt she stayed with them only long enough to hear theirfavourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dressbut she had no reason to fear mr and mrs gardiners curiosity it wasnot their wish to force her communication it was evident that she wasmuch better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any idea ofit was evident that he was very much in love with her they saw much tointerest but nothing to justify inquiryof mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as faras their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find they couldnot be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his characterfrom their own feelings and his servants report without any referenceto any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was knownwould not have recognized it for mr darcy there was now an interesthowever in believing the housekeeper and they soon became sensiblethat the authority of a servant who had known him since he was fouryears old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to behastily rejected neither had anything occurred in the intelligence oftheir lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight they hadnothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if notit would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small markettownwhere the family did not visit it was acknowledged however that hewas a liberal man and did much good among the poorwith respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not heldthere in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with theson of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a wellknownfact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behindhim which mr darcy afterwards dischargedas for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more thanthe last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was notlong enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansionand she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out shecertainly did not hate him no hatred had vanished long ago and shehad almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against himthat could be so called the respect created by the conviction of hisvaluable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for sometime ceased to be repugnant to her feeling and it was now heightenedinto somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly inhis favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a lightwhich yesterday had produced but above all above respect and esteemthere was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlookedit was gratitude gratitude not merely for having once loved herbut for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance andacrimony of her manner in rejecting him and all the unjust accusationsaccompanying her rejection he who she had been persuaded would avoidher as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting mosteager to preserve the acquaintance and without any indelicate displayof regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves onlywere concerned was soliciting the good opinion of her friends and benton making her known to his sister such a change in a man of so muchpride exciting not only astonishment but gratitudefor to love ardentlove it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of asort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not beexactly defined she respected she esteemed she was grateful to himshe felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know howfar she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it wouldbe for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which herfancy told her she still possessed of bringing on her the renewal ofhis addressesit had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece thatsuch a striking civility as miss darcys in coming to see them on thevery day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to alate breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalledby some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently thatit would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the followingmorning they were therefore to go elizabeth was pleased though whenshe asked herself the reason she had very little to say in replymr gardiner left them soon after breakfast the fishing scheme had beenrenewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meetingsome of the gentlemen at pemberley before noonconvinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingleys dislike of her hadoriginated in jealousy she could not help feeling how unwelcome herappearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with howmuch civility on that ladys side the acquaintance would now be renewedon reaching the house they were shown through the hall into the saloonwhose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer its windowsopening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woodyhills behind the house and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chestnutswhich were scattered over the intermediate lawnin this house they were received by miss darcy who was sitting therewith mrs hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived inlondon georgianas reception of them was very civil but attended withall the embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the fearof doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves inferiorthe belief of her being proud and reserved mrs gardiner and her niecehowever did her justice and pitied herby mrs hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey andon their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always besucceeded for a few moments it was first broken by mrs annesley agenteel agreeablelooking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kindof discourse proved her to be more truly wellbred than either of theothers and between her and mrs gardiner with occasional help fromelizabeth the conversation was carried on miss darcy looked as if shewished for courage enough to join in it and sometimes did venture ashort sentence when there was least danger of its being heardelizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingleyand that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy withoutcalling her attention this observation would not have prevented herfrom trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at aninconvenient distance but she was not sorry to be spared the necessityof saying much her own thoughts were employing her she expected everymoment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room she wished shefeared that the master of the house might be amongst them and whethershe wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine aftersitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing missbingleys voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a coldinquiry after the health of her family she answered with equalindifference and brevity and the other said no morethe next variation which their visit afforded was produced by theentrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all thefinest fruits in season but this did not take place till after manya significant look and smile from mrs annesley to miss darcy had beengiven to remind her of her post there was now employment for the wholepartyfor though they could not all talk they could all eat and thebeautiful pyramids of grapes nectarines and peaches soon collectedthem round the tablewhile thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whethershe most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy by thefeelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then though buta moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began toregret that he camehe had been some time with mr gardiner who with two or three othergentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left himonly on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit togeorgiana that morning no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wiselyresolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed a resolution the morenecessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because shesaw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against themand that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviourwhen he first came into the room in no countenance was attentivecuriosity so strongly marked as in miss bingleys in spite of thesmiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of itsobjects for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attentionsto mr darcy were by no means over miss darcy on her brothersentrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that hewas anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwardedas much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side missbingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took thefirst opportunity of saying with sneering civilitypray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from merytonthey must be a great loss to your familyin darcys presence she dared not mention wickhams name but elizabethinstantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and thevarious recollections connected with him gave her a moments distressbut exerting herself vigorously to repel the illnatured attack shepresently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone whileshe spoke an involuntary glance showed her darcy with a heightenedcomplexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome withconfusion and unable to lift up her eyes had miss bingley known whatpain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly wouldhave refrained from the hint but she had merely intended to discomposeelizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believedher partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her indarcys opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the folliesand absurdities by which some part of her family were connectedwith that corps not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcysmeditated elopement to no creature had it been revealed where secrecywas possible except to elizabeth and from all bingleys connectionsher brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from the verywish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becominghereafter her own he had certainly formed such a plan and withoutmeaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from missbennet it is probable that it might add something to his lively concernfor the welfare of his friendelizabeths collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion andas miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer towickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be ableto speak any more her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcelyrecollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance whichhad been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to havefixed them on her more and more cheerfullytheir visit did not continue long after the question and answer abovementioned and while mr darcy was attending them to their carriage missbingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeths personbehaviour and dress but georgiana would not join her her brothersrecommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgement could noterr and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgianawithout the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable whendarcy returned to the saloon miss bingley could not help repeating tohim some part of what she had been saying to his sisterhow very ill miss eliza bennet looks this morning mr darcy shecried i never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is sincethe winter she is grown so brown and coarse louisa and i were agreeingthat we should not have known her againhowever little mr darcy might have liked such an address he contentedhimself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration thanher being rather tanned no miraculous consequence of travelling in thesummerfor my own part she rejoined i must confess that i never couldsee any beauty in her her face is too thin her complexion has nobrilliancy and her features are not at all handsome her nosewants characterthere is nothing marked in its lines her teeth aretolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyeswhich have sometimes been called so fine i could never see anythingextraordinary in them they have a sharp shrewish look which i donot like at all and in her air altogether there is a selfsufficiencywithout fashion which is intolerablepersuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was notthe best method of recommending herself but angry people are not alwayswise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all thesuccess she expected he was resolutely silent however and from adetermination of making him speak she continuedi remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we allwere to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollectyour saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield shea beautyi should as soon call her mother a wit but afterwards sheseemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty atone timeyes replied darcy who could contain himself no longer but thatwas only when i first saw her for it is many months since i haveconsidered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintancehe then went away and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction ofhaving forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herselfmrs gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during theirvisit as they returned except what had particularly interested themboth the look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussedexcept of the person who had mostly engaged their attention they talkedof his sister his friends his house his fruitof everything buthimself yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs gardiner thought ofhim and mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niecesbeginning the subjectelizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter fromjane on their first arrival at lambton and this disappointment had beenrenewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there buton the third her repining was over and her sister justified by thereceipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked thatit had been missent elsewhere elizabeth was not surprised at it asjane had written the direction remarkably illthey had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in andher uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them in quiet set off bythemselves the one missent must first be attended to it had beenwritten five days ago the beginning contained an account of all theirlittle parties and engagements with such news as the country affordedbut the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evidentagitation gave more important intelligence it was to this effectsince writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred of amost unexpected and serious nature but i am afraid of alarming youbeassured that we are all well what i have to say relates to poor lydiaan express came at twelve last night just as we were all gone to bedfrom colonel forster to inform us that she was gone off to scotlandwith one of his officers to own the truth with wickham imagine oursurprise to kitty however it does not seem so wholly unexpected i amvery very sorry so imprudent a match on both sides but i am willingto hope the best and that his character has been misunderstoodthoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him but this stepand let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart his choice isdisinterested at least for he must know my father can give her nothingour poor mother is sadly grieved my father bears it better howthankful am i that we never let them know what has been said againsthim we must forget it ourselves they were off saturday night abouttwelve as is conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning ateight the express was sent off directly my dear lizzy they must havepassed within ten miles of us colonel forster gives us reason to expecthim here soon lydia left a few lines for his wife informing her oftheir intention i must conclude for i cannot be long from my poormother i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardlyknow what i have writtenwithout allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowingwhat she felt elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized theother and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows ithad been written a day later than the conclusion of the firstby this time my dearest sister you have received my hurried letter iwish this may be more intelligible but though not confined for time myhead is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent dearestlizzy i hardly know what i would write but i have bad news for youand it cannot be delayed imprudent as the marriage between mr wickhamand our poor lydia would be we are now anxious to be assured it hastaken place for there is but too much reason to fear they are not goneto scotland colonel forster came yesterday having left brighton theday before not many hours after the express though lydias shortletter to mrs f gave them to understand that they were going to gretnagreen something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that wnever intended to go there or to marry lydia at all which wasrepeated to colonel f who instantly taking the alarm set off from bintending to trace their route he did trace them easily to claphambut no further for on entering that place they removed into a hackneycoach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom all thatis known after this is that they were seen to continue the london roadi know not what to think after making every possible inquiry on thatside london colonel f came on into hertfordshire anxiously renewingthem at all the turnpikes and at the inns in barnet and hatfield butwithout any successno such people had been seen to pass through withthe kindest concern he came on to longbourn and broke his apprehensionsto us in a manner most creditable to his heart i am sincerely grievedfor him and mrs f but no one can throw any blame on them ourdistress my dear lizzy is very great my father and mother believe theworst but i cannot think so ill of him many circumstances might makeit more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursuetheir first plan and even if he could form such a design against ayoung woman of lydias connections which is not likely can i supposeher so lost to everything impossible i grieve to find however thatcolonel f is not disposed to depend upon their marriage he shook hishead when i expressed my hopes and said he feared w was not a man tobe trusted my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room could sheexert herself it would be better but this is not to be expected andas to my father i never in my life saw him so affected poor kitty hasanger for having concealed their attachment but as it was a matter ofconfidence one cannot wonder i am truly glad dearest lizzy that youhave been spared something of these distressing scenes but now as thefirst shock is over shall i own that i long for your return i am notso selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient adieu itake up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not butcircumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging you all tocome here as soon as possible i know my dear uncle and aunt so wellthat i am not afraid of requesting it though i have still somethingmore to ask of the former my father is going to london with colonelforster instantly to try to discover her what he means to do i am surei know not but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue anymeasure in the best and safest way and colonel forster is obliged tobe at brighton again tomorrow evening in such an exigence myuncles advice and assistance would be everything in the world he willimmediately comprehend what i must feel and i rely upon his goodnessoh where where is my uncle cried elizabeth darting from her seatas she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him without losinga moment of the time so precious but as she reached the door it wasopened by a servant and mr darcy appeared her pale face and impetuousmanner made him start and before he could recover himself to speakshe in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydias situationhastily exclaimed i beg your pardon but i must leave you i must findmr gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed i have notan instant to losegood god what is the matter cried he with more feeling thanpoliteness then recollecting himself i will not detain you a minutebut let me or let the servant go after mr and mrs gardiner you arenot well enough you cannot go yourselfelizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt howlittle would be gained by her attempting to pursue them calling backthe servant therefore she commissioned him though in so breathlessan accent as made her almost unintelligible to fetch his master andmistress home instantlyon his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself andlooking so miserably ill that it was impossible for darcy to leave heror to refrain from saying in
