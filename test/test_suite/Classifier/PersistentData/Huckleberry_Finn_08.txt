far enough above the town to see i could make thetowhead i begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow and the firsttime the lightning showed me one that wasnt chained i snatched it andshoved it was a canoe and warnt fastened with nothing but a rope the towhead was a rattling big distance off away out there in themiddle of the river but i didnt lose no time and when i struck theraft at last i was so fagged i would a just laid down to blow and gaspif i could afforded it  but i didnt  as i sprung aboard i sung outout with you jim and set her loose  glory be to goodness were shutof themjim lit out and was acoming for me with both arms spread he was sofull of joy but when i glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot upin my mouth and i went overboard backwards for i forgot he was old kinglear and a drownded arab all in one and it most scared the livers andlights out of me  but jim fished me out and was going to hug me andbless me and so on he was so glad i was back and we was shut of theking and the duke but i saysnot now have it for breakfast have it for breakfast  cut loose andlet her slideso in two seconds away we went asliding down the river and it didseem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river andnobody to bother us  i had to skip around a bit and jump up and crackmy heels a few timesi couldnt help it but about the third cracki noticed a sound that i knowed mighty well and held my breath andlistened and waited and sure enough when the next flash busted outover the water here they comeand just alaying to their oars andmaking their skiff hum  it was the king and the dukeso i wilted right down on to the planks then and give up and it wasall i could do to keep from cryingwhen they got aboard the king went for me and shook me by the collarand saystryin to give us the slip was ye you pup  tired of our companyheyi saysno your majesty we warntplease dont your majestyquick then and tell us what was your idea or ill shake theinsides out o youhonest ill tell you everything just as it happened your majesty the man that had aholt of me was very good to me and kept saying hehad a boy about as big as me that died last year and he was sorryto see a boy in such a dangerous fix and when they was all took bysurprise by finding the gold and made a rush for the coffin he lets goof me and whispers heel it now or theyll hang ye sure and i litout  it didnt seem no good for me to stayi couldnt do nothingand i didnt want to be hung if i could get away  so i never stoppedrunning till i found the canoe and when i got here i told jim to hurryor theyd catch me and hang me yet and said i was afeard you and theduke wasnt alive now and i was awful sorry and so was jim and wasawful glad when we see you coming you may ask jim if i didntjim said it was so and the king told him to shut up and said ohyes its mighty likely and shook me up again and said he reckonedhed drownd me  but the duke saysleggo the boy you old idiot  would you a done any different  didyou inquire around for him when you got loose  i dont remember itso the king let go of me and begun to cuss that town and everybody init but the duke saysyou better a blame sight give yourself a good cussing for yourethe one thats entitled to it most  you haint done a thing from thestart that had any sense in it except coming out so cool and cheekywith that imaginary bluearrow mark  that was brightit was rightdown bully and it was the thing that saved us  for if it hadnt beenfor that theyd a jailed us till them englishmens baggage comeandthenthe penitentiary you bet but that trick took em to thegraveyard and the gold done us a still bigger kindness for if theexcited fools hadnt let go all holts and made that rush to get alook wed a slept in our cravats tonightcravats warranted to weartoolonger than wed need emthey was still a minutethinking then the king says kind ofabsentminded likemf  and we reckoned the niggers stole itthat made me squirmyes says the duke kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic wedidafter about a half a minute the king drawls outleastways i didthe duke says the same wayon the contrary i didthe king kind of ruffles up and sayslooky here bilgewater whatr you referrin tothe duke says pretty briskwhen it comes to that maybe youll let me ask what was youreferring toshucks says the king very sarcastic but i dont knowmaybe you wasasleep and didnt know what you was aboutthe duke bristles up now and saysoh let up on this cussed nonsense do you take me for a blame fooldont you reckon i know who hid that money in that coffinyes sir  i know you do know because you done it yourselfits a lieand the duke went for him  the king sings outtake yr hands offleggo my throati take it all backthe duke sayswell you just own up first that you did hide that money thereintending to give me the slip one of these days and come back and digit up and have it all to yourselfwait jest a minute dukeanswer me this one question honest and fairif you didnt put the money there say it and ill blieve you andtake back everything i saidyou old scoundrel i didnt and you know i didnt  there nowwell then i blieve you  but answer me only jest this one morenowdont git mad didnt you have it in your mind to hook the money andhide itthe duke never said nothing for a little bit then he sayswell i dont care if i did i didnt do it anyway  but you notonly had it in mind to do it but you done iti wisht i never die if i done it duke and thats honest  i wont sayi warnt goin to do it because i was but youi mean somebodygot inahead o meits a lie  you done it and you got to say you done it orthe king began to gurgle and then he gasps outnoughi own upi was very glad to hear him say that it made me feel much more easierthan what i was feeling before  so the duke took his hands off andsaysif you ever deny it again ill drown you  its well for you to setthere and blubber like a babyits fitten for you after the wayyouve acted i never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobbleeverythingand i atrusting you all the time like you was my ownfather  you ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear itsaddled on to a lot of poor niggers and you never say a word for em it makes me feel ridiculous to think i was soft enough to believethat rubbage  cuss you i can see now why you was so anxious to makeup the deffisityou wanted to get what money id got out of the nonesuchand one thing or another and scoop it allthe king says timid and still asnufflingwhy duke it was you that said make up the deffisit it warnt medry up  i dont want to hear no more out of you says the duke  andnow you see what you got by it  theyve got all their own money backand all of ourn but a shekel or two besides  glong to bed anddont you deffersit me no more deffersits long s you liveso the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfortand before long the duke tackled his bottle and so in about a half anhour they was as thick as thieves again and the tighter they got thelovinger they got and went off asnoring in each others arms  theyboth got powerful mellow but i noticed the king didnt get mellowenough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the moneybagagain  that made me feel easy and satisfied  of course when they gotto snoring we had a long gabble and i told jim everythingwe dasnt stop again at any town for days and days kept right alongdown the river  we was down south in the warm weather now and a mightylong ways from home  we begun to come to trees with spanish moss onthem hanging down from the limbs like long gray beards  it was thefirst i ever see it growing and it made the woods look solemn anddismal  so now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger and theybegun to work the villages againfirst they done a lecture on temperance but they didnt make enoughfor them both to get drunk on  then in another village they starteda dancingschool but they didnt know no more how to dance than akangaroo does so the first prance they made the general public jumpedin and pranced them out of town  another time they tried to go atyellocution but they didnt yellocute long till the audience got up andgive them a solid good cussing and made them skip out  they tackledmissionarying and mesmerizing and doctoring and telling fortunes anda little of everything but they couldnt seem to have no luck  so atlast they got just about dead broke and laid around the raft as shefloated along thinking and thinking and never saying nothing by thehalf a day at a time and dreadful blue and desperateand at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together inthe wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a timejim and me got uneasy  we didnt like the look of it  we judged theywas studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever  we turned itover and over and at last we made up our minds they was going to breakinto somebodys house or store or was going into the counterfeitmoneybusiness or something so then we was pretty scared and made up anagreement that we wouldnt have nothing in the world to do with suchactions and if we ever got the least show we would give them the coldshake and clear out and leave them behind well early one morning wehid the raft in a good safe place about two mile below a little bit ofa shabby village named pikesville and the king he went ashore and toldus all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to seeif anybody had got any wind of the royal nonesuch there yet house torob you mean says i to myself and when you get through robbing ityoull come back here and wonder what has become of me and jim and theraftand youll have to take it out in wondering and he said if hewarnt back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right andwe was to come alongso we stayed where we was  the duke he fretted and sweated around andwas in a mighty sour way  he scolded us for everything and we couldntseem to do nothing right he found fault with every little thingsomething was abrewing sure  i was good and glad when midday comeand no king we could have a change anywayand maybe a chance for thechange on top of it  so me and the duke went up to the village andhunted around there for the king and by and by we found him in theback room of a little low doggery very tight and a lot of loafersbullyragging him for sport and he acussing and athreatening with allhis might and so tight he couldnt walk and couldnt do nothing tothem  the duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool and the kingbegun to sass back and the minute they was fairly at it i lit out andshook the reefs out of my hind legs and spun down the river road likea deer for i see our chance and i made up my mind that it would be along day before they ever see me and jim again  i got down there allout of breath but loaded up with joy and sung outset her loose jim were all right nowbut there warnt no answer and nobody come out of the wigwam  jim wasgone  i set up a shoutand then anotherand then another one and runthis way and that in the woods whooping and screeching but it warntno useold jim was gone  then i set down and cried i couldnt helpit but i couldnt set still long  pretty soon i went out on the roadtrying to think what i better do and i run across a boy walking andasked him if hed seen a strange nigger dressed so and so and he saysyeswhereabouts says idown to silas phelps place two mile below here  hes a runawaynigger and theyve got him  was you looking for himyou bet i aint  i run across him in the woods about an hour or twoago and he said if i hollered hed cut my livers outand told me to laydown and stay where i was and i done it  been there ever since afeardto come outwell he says you neednt be afeard no more becuz theyve got himhe run off fm down south somersits a good job they got himwell i reckon  theres two hunderd dollars reward on him  itslike picking up money outn the roadyes it isand i could a had it if id been big enough i see himfirst who nailed himit was an old fellowa strangerand he sold out his chance in him forforty dollars becuz hes got to go up the river and cant wait  thinko that now  you bet id wait if it was seven yearthats me every time says i  but maybe his chance aint worthno more than that if hell sell it so cheap  maybe theres somethingaint straight about itbut it is thoughstraight as a string  i see the handbill myself it tells all about him to a dotpaints him like a picture and tellsthe plantation hes frum below newrleans  nosirreebob theyaint no trouble bout that speculation you bet you  say gimme achaw tobacker wont yei didnt have none so he left  i went to the raft and set down in thewigwam to think  but i couldnt come to nothing  i thought till i woremy head sore but i couldnt see no way out of the trouble  after allthis long journey and after all wed done for them scoundrels here itwas all come to nothing everything all busted up and ruined becausethey could have the heart to serve jim such a trick as that and makehim a slave again all his life and amongst strangers too for fortydirty dollarsonce i said to myself it would be a thousand times better for jim tobe a slave at home where his family was as long as hed got to be aslave and so id better write a letter to tom sawyer and tell him totell miss watson where he was  but i soon give up that notion for twothings shed be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulnessfor leaving her and so shed sell him straight down the river againand if she didnt everybody naturally despises an ungrateful niggerand theyd make jim feel it all the time and so hed feel ornery anddisgraced and then think of me  it would get all around that huckfinn helped a nigger to get his freedom and if i was ever to seeanybody from that town again id be ready to get down and lick his bootsfor shame  thats just the way  a person does a lowdown thing andthen he dont want to take no consequences of it thinks as long as hecan hide it it aint no disgrace  that was my fix exactly the more istudied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me and themore wicked and lowdown and ornery i got to feeling and at last whenit hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of providenceslapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was beingwatched all the time from up there in heaven whilst i was stealing apoor old womans nigger that hadnt ever done me no harm and now wasshowing me theres one thats always on the lookout and aint agoingto allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no furtheri most dropped in my tracks i was so scared  well i tried the best icould to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying i was brungup wicked and so i warnt so much to blame but something inside of mekept saying there was the sundayschool you could a gone to it andif youd a done it theyd a learnt you there that people that acts asid been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fireit made me shiver  and i about made up my mind to pray and see if icouldnt try to quit being the kind of a boy i was and be better  soi kneeled down  but the words wouldnt come  why wouldnt they  itwarnt no use to try and hide it from him  nor from me neither  iknowed very well why they wouldnt come  it was because my heart warntright it was because i warnt square it was because i was playingdouble  i was letting on to give up sin but away inside of me i washolding on to the biggest one of all  i was trying to make my mouthsay i would do the right thing and the clean thing and go and writeto that niggers owner and tell where he was but deep down in me iknowed it was a lie and he knowed it  you cant pray a liei foundthat outso i was full of trouble full as i could be and didnt know what todo at last i had an idea and i says ill go and write the letterandthen see if i can pray  why it was astonishing the way i felt aslight as a feather right straight off and my troubles all gone  so igot a piece of paper and a pencil all glad and excited and set downand wrotemiss watson your runaway nigger jim is down here two mile belowpikesville and mr phelps has got him and he will give him up for thereward if you sendhuck finni felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time i had everfelt so in my life and i knowed i could pray now  but i didnt do itstraight off but laid the paper down and set there thinkingthinkinghow good it was all this happened so and how near i come to being lostand going to hell  and went on thinking  and got to thinking over ourtrip down the river and i see jim before me all the time  in the dayand in the nighttime sometimes moonlight sometimes storms and weafloating along talking and singing and laughing  but somehow icouldnt seem to strike no places to harden me against him but only theother kind  id see him standing my watch on top of hisn stead ofcalling me so i could go on sleeping and see him how glad he was wheni come back out of the fog and when i come to him again in the swampup there where the feud was and suchlike times and would always callme honey and pet me and do everything he could think of for me and howgood he always was and at last i struck the time i saved him by tellingthe men we had smallpox aboard and he was so grateful and said i wasthe best friend old jim ever had in the world and the only one hesgot now and then i happened to look around and see that paperit was a close place  i took it up and held it in my hand  i wasatrembling because id got to decide forever betwixt two things andi knowed it  i studied a minute sort of holding my breath and thensays to myselfall right then ill go to helland tore it upit was awful thoughts and awful words but they was said  and i letthem stay said and never thought no more about reforming  i shoved thewhole thing out of my head and said i would take up wickedness againwhich was in my line being brung up to it and the other warnt  andfor a starter i would go to work and steal jim out of slavery againand if i could think up anything worse i would do that too because aslong as i was in and in for good i might as well go the whole hogthen i set to thinking over how to get at it and turned over someconsiderable many ways in my mind and at last fixed up a plan thatsuited me  so then i took the bearings of a woody island that was downthe river a piece and as soon as it was fairly dark i crept out with myraft and went for it and hid it there and then turned in  i slept thenight through and got up before it was light and had my breakfastand put on my store clothes and tied up some others and one thing oranother in a bundle and took the canoe and cleared for shore  i landedbelow where i judged was phelpss place and hid my bundle in the woodsand then filled up the canoe with water and loaded rocks into her andsunk her where i could find her again when i wanted her about a quarterof a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bankthen i struck up the road and when i passed the mill i see a sign onit phelpss sawmill and when i come to the farmhouses two orthree hundred yards further along i kept my eyes peeled but didntsee nobody around though it was good daylight now  but i didnt mindbecause i didnt want to see nobody just yeti only wanted to get thelay of the land according to my plan i was going to turn up there fromthe village not from below  so i just took a look and shoved alongstraight for town well the very first man i see when i got there wasthe duke  he was sticking up a bill for the royal nonesuchthreenightperformancelike that other time  they had the cheek them frauds  iwas right on him before i could shirk  he looked astonished and sayshello  whered you come from  then he says kind of glad andeager wheres the raftgot her in a good placei sayswhy thats just what i was going to ask your gracethen he didnt look so joyful and sayswhat was your idea for asking me he sayswell i says when i see the king in that doggery yesterday i saysto myself we cant get him home for hours till hes soberer so i wentaloafing around town to put in the time and wait  a man up and offeredme ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetcha sheep and so i went along but when we was dragging him to the boatand the man left me aholt of the rope and went behind him to shove himalong he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run and we afterhim  we didnt have no dog and so we had to chase him all over thecountry till we tired him out  we never got him till dark then wefetched him over and i started down for the raft  when i got there andsee it was gone i says to myself theyve got into trouble and had toleave and theyve took my nigger which is the only nigger ive got inthe world and now im in a strange country and aint got no propertyno more nor nothing and no way to make my living so i set down andcried  i slept in the woods all night  but what did become of theraft thenand jimpoor jimblamed if i knowthat is whats become of the raft  that old fool hadmade a trade and got forty dollars and when we found him in the doggerythe loafers had matched halfdollars with him and got every cent butwhat hed spent for whisky and when i got him home late last night andfound the raft gone we said that little rascal has stole our raft andshook us and run off down the riveri wouldnt shake my nigger would ithe only nigger i had in theworld and the only propertywe never thought of that  fact is i reckon wed come to consider himour nigger yes we did consider him sogoodness knows we had troubleenough for him  so when we see the raft was gone and we flat brokethere warnt anything for it but to try the royal nonesuch anothershake and ive pegged along ever since dry as a powderhorn  wheresthat ten cents give it herei had considerable money so i give him ten cents but begged him tospend it for something to eat and give me some because it was all themoney i had and i hadnt had nothing to eat since yesterday  he neversaid nothing  the next minute he whirls on me and saysdo you reckon that nigger would blow on us  wed skin him if he donethathow can he blow  haint he run offno  that old fool sold him and never divided with me and the moneysgonesold him  i says and begun to cry why he was my nigger andthat was my money  where is hei want my niggerwell you cant get your nigger thats allso dry up yourblubbering looky heredo you think youd venture to blow on us blamed if i think id trust you  why if you was to blow on ushe stopped but i never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyesbefore i went on awhimpering and saysi dont want to blow on nobody and i aint got no time to blow nohowi got to turn out and find my niggerhe looked kinder bothered and stood there with his bills fluttering onhis arm thinking and wrinkling up his forehead  at last he saysill tell you something  we got to be here three days  if youllpromise you wont blow and wont let the nigger blow ill tell youwhere to find himso i promised and he saysa farmer by the name of silas ph and then he stopped  you see hestarted to tell me the truth but when he stopped that way and begun tostudy and think again i reckoned he was changing his mind  and so hewas he wouldnt trust me he wanted to make sure of having me out ofthe way the whole three days  so pretty soon he saysthe man that bought him is named abram fosterabram g fosterand helives forty mile back here in the country on the road to lafayetteall right i says i can walk it in three days  and ill start thisvery afternoonno you wont youll start now and dont you lose any time about itneither nor do any gabbling by the way  just keep a tight tongue inyour head and move right along and then you wont get into trouble withus dye hearthat was the order i wanted and that was the one i played for  iwanted to be left free to work my plansso clear out he says and you can tell mr foster whatever you wantto maybe you can get him to believe that jim is your niggersomeidiots dont require documentsleastways ive heard theres such downsouth here  and when you tell him the handbill and the rewards bogusmaybe hell believe you when you explain to him what the idea was forgetting em out  go long now and tell him anything you want to butmind you dont work your jaw any between here and thereso i left and struck for the back country  i didnt look around but ikinder felt like he was watching me  but i knowed i could tire him outat that  i went straight out in the country as much as a mile beforei stopped then i doubled back through the woods towards phelps  ireckoned i better start in on my plan straight off without foolingaround because i wanted to stop jims mouth till these fellows couldget away  i didnt want no trouble with their kind  id seen all iwanted to of them and wanted to get entirely shut of themwhen i got there it was all still and sundaylike and hot and sunshinythe hands was gone to the fields and there was them kind of faintdronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome andlike everybodys dead and gone and if a breeze fans along and quiversthe leaves it makes you feel mournful because you feel like itsspirits whisperingspirits thats been dead ever so many yearsand youalways think theyre talking about you  as a general thing it makes abody wish he was dead too and done with it allphelps was one of these little onehorse cotton plantations and theyall look alike  a rail fence round a twoacre yard a stile made outof logs sawed off and upended in steps like barrels of a differentlength to climb over the fence with and for the women to stand on whenthey are going to jump on to a horse some sickly grasspatches in thebig yard but mostly it was bare and smooth like an old hat with thenap rubbed off big double loghouse for the white folkshewed logswith the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar and these mudstripesbeen whitewashed some time or another roundlog kitchen with a bigbroad open but roofed passage joining it to the house log smokehouseback of the kitchen three little log niggercabins in a row totherside the smokehouse one little hut all by itself away down againstthe back fence and some outbuildings down a piece the other sideashhopper and big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut bench bythe kitchen door with bucket of water and a gourd hound asleep therein the sun more hounds asleep round about about three shade trees awayoff in a corner some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one placeby the fence outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch thenthe cotton fields begins and after the fields the woodsi went around and clumb over the back stile by the ashhopper andstarted for the kitchen  when i got a little ways i heard the dim humof a spinningwheel wailing along up and sinking along down againand then i knowed for certain i wished i was deadfor that is thelonesomest sound in the whole worldi went right along not fixing up any particular plan but just trustingto providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come forid noticed that providence always did put the right words in my mouthif i left it alonewhen i got halfway first one hound and then another got up and wentfor me and of course i stopped and faced them and kept still  andsuch another powwow as they made  in a quarter of a minute i was a kindof a hub of a wheel as you may sayspokes made out of dogscircle offifteen of them packed together around me with their necks and nosesstretched up towards me abarking and howling and more acoming youcould see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheresa nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rollingpin in herhand singing out begone you tige you spot begone sah and shefetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howlingand then the rest followed and the next second half of them come backwagging their tails around me and making friends with me  there aintno harm in a hound nohowand behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little niggerboys without anything on but towlinen shirts and they hung on to theirmothers gown and peeped out from behind her at me bashful the waythey always do  and here comes the white woman running from the houseabout fortyfive or fifty year old bareheaded and her spinningstickin her hand and behind her comes her little white children acting thesame way the little niggers was doing  she was smiling all over so shecould hardly standand saysits you at lastaint iti out with a yesm before i thoughtshe grabbed me and hugged me tight and then gripped me by both handsand shook

ever i askyouor the likes of youwell he says it does surprise me so  i cant make it out somehowthey said you would and i thought you would  but he stopped andlooked around slow like he wished he could run across a friendly eyesomewheres and fetched up on the old gentlemans and says didntyou think shed like me to kiss her sirwhy no iiwell no i blieve i didntthen he looks on around the same way to me and saystom didnt you think aunt sally d open out her arms and say sidsawyermy land she says breaking in and jumping for him you impudentyoung rascal to fool a body so and was going to hug him but hefended her off and saysno not till youve asked me firstso she didnt lose no time but asked him and hugged him and kissedhim over and over again and then turned him over to the old man and hetook what was left  and after they got a little quiet again she sayswhy dear me i never see such a surprise  we warnt looking for youat all but only tom  sis never wrote to me about anybody coming buthimits because it warnt intended for any of us to come but tom hesays but i begged and begged and at the last minute she let mecome too so coming down the river me and tom thought it would be afirstrate surprise for him to come here to the house first and for meto by and by tag along and drop in and let on to be a stranger  but itwas a mistake aunt sally  this aint no healthy place for a strangerto comenonot impudent whelps sid  you ought to had your jaws boxed ihaint been so put out since i dont know when  but i dont care idont mind the termsid be willing to stand a thousand such jokes tohave you here well to think of that performance  i dont deny it iwas most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smackwe had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house andthe kitchen and there was things enough on that table for sevenfamiliesand all hot too none of your flabby tough meat thats laidin a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk ofold cold cannibal in the morning  uncle silas he asked a pretty longblessing over it but it was worth it and it didnt cool it a bitneither the way ive seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times there was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon and meand tom was on the lookout all the time but it warnt no use theydidnt happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger and we was afraidto try to work up to it  but at supper at night one of the littleboys sayspa maynt tom and sid and me go to the showno says the old man i reckon there aint going to be any and youcouldnt go if there was because the runaway nigger told burton andme all about that scandalous show and burton said he would tell thepeople so i reckon theyve drove the owdacious loafers out of townbefore this timeso there it wasbut i couldnt help it  tom and me was to sleep in thesame room and bed so being tired we bid goodnight and went up tobed right after supper and clumb out of the window and down thelightningrod and shoved for the town for i didnt believe anybody wasgoing to give the king and the duke a hint and so if i didnt hurry upand give them one theyd get into trouble sureon the road tom he told me all about how it was reckoned i was murderedand how pap disappeared pretty soon and didnt come back no more andwhat a stir there was when jim run away and i told tom all about ourroyal nonesuch rapscallions and as much of the raft voyage as i hadtime to and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle ofitit was as much as halfafter eight thenhere comes a raging rush ofpeople with torches and an awful whooping and yelling and banging tinpans and blowing horns and we jumped to one side to let them go byand as they went by i see they had the king and the duke astraddle of arailthat is i knowed it was the king and the duke though they wasall over tar and feathers and didnt look like nothing in theworld that was humanjust looked like a couple of monstrous bigsoldierplumes  well it made me sick to see it and i was sorry forthem poor pitiful rascals it seemed like i couldnt ever feel anyhardness against them any more in the world  it was a dreadful thing tosee  human beings can be awful cruel to one anotherwe see we was too latecouldnt do no good  we asked some stragglersabout it and they said everybody went to the show looking veryinnocent and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in themiddle of his cavortings on the stage then somebody give a signal andthe house rose up and went for themso we poked along back home and i warnt feeling so brash as i wasbefore but kind of ornery and humble and to blame somehowthoughi hadnt done nothing  but thats always the way it dont make nodifference whether you do right or wrong a persons conscience aintgot no sense and just goes for him anyway  if i had a yaller dog thatdidnt know no more than a persons conscience does i would pison himit takes up more room than all the rest of a persons insides and yetaint no good nohow  tom sawyer he says the samewe stopped talking and got to thinking  by and by tom sayslooky here huck what fools we are to not think of it before  i bet iknow where jim isno  wherein that hut down by the ashhopper  why looky here  when we was atdinner didnt you see a nigger man go in there with some vittlesyeswhat did you think the vittles was forfor a dogso d i well it wasnt for a dogwhybecause part of it was watermelonso it wasi noticed it  well it does beat all that i never thoughtabout a dog not eating watermelon  it shows how a body can see anddont see at the same timewell the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in and he locked itagain when he came out  he fetched uncle a key about the time we got upfrom tablesame key i bet  watermelon shows man lock shows prisonerand it aint likely theres two prisoners on such a little plantationand where the peoples all so kind and good  jims the prisoner  allrightim glad we found it out detective fashion i wouldnt give shucksfor any other way  now you work your mind and study out a plan tosteal jim and i will study out one too and well take the one we likethe bestwhat a head for just a boy to have  if i had tom sawyers head iwouldnt trade it off to be a duke nor mate of a steamboat nor clownin a circus nor nothing i can think of  i went to thinking out a planbut only just to be doing something i knowed very well where the rightplan was going to come from  pretty soon tom saysreadyyes i saysall rightbring it outmy plan is this i says  we can easy find out if its jim in therethen get up my canoe tomorrow night and fetch my raft over from theisland  then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of theold mans britches after he goes to bed and shove off down the riveron the raft with jim hiding daytimes and running nights the way me andjim used to do before  wouldnt that plan workwork  why certnly it would work like rats afighting  but itstoo blame simple there aint nothing to it  whats the good of aplan that aint no more trouble than that  its as mild as goosemilk why huck it wouldnt make no more talk than breaking into a soapfactoryi never said nothing because i warnt expecting nothing different buti knowed mighty well that whenever he got his plan ready it wouldnthave none of them objections to itand it didnt  he told me what it was and i see in a minute it wasworth fifteen of mine for style and would make jim just as free a manas mine would and maybe get us all killed besides  so i was satisfiedand said we would waltz in on it  i neednt tell what it was herebecause i knowed it wouldnt stay the way it was  i knowed he would bechanging it around every which way as we went along and heaving in newbullinesses wherever he got a chance  and that is what he donewell one thing was dead sure and that was that tom sawyer was inearnest and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slaverythat was the thing that was too many for me  here was a boy that wasrespectable and well brung up and had a character to lose and folks athome that had characters and he was bright and not leatherheaded andknowing and not ignorant and not mean but kind and yet here he waswithout any more pride or rightness or feeling than to stoop tothis business and make himself a shame and his family a shamebefore everybody  i couldnt understand it no way at all  it wasoutrageous and i knowed i ought to just up and tell him so and so behis true friend and let him quit the thing right where he was and savehimself and i did start to tell him but he shut me up and saysdont you reckon i know what im about  dont i generly know what imaboutyesdidnt i say i was going to help steal the niggeryeswell thenthats all he said and thats all i said  it warnt no use to say anymore because when he said hed do a thing he always done it  but icouldnt make out how he was willing to go into this thing so i justlet it go and never bothered no more about it  if he was bound to haveit so i couldnt help itwhen we got home the house was all dark and still so we went on down tothe hut by
