manner that you are suffered to do at homei did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were astudier of character it must be an amusing studyyes but intricate characters are the most amusing they have atleast that advantagethe country said darcy can in general supply but a few subjects forsuch a study in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined andunvarying societybut people themselves alter so much that there is something new to beobserved in them for everyes indeed cried mrs bennet offended by his manner of mentioninga country neighbourhood i assure you there is quite as much of thatgoing on in the country as in towneverybody was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a momentturned silently away mrs bennet who fancied she had gained a completevictory over him continued her triumphi cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country formy part except the shops and public places the country is a vast dealpleasanter is it not mr bingleywhen i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave itand when i am in town it is pretty much the same they have each theiradvantages and i can be equally happy in eitherayethat is because you have the right disposition but thatgentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was nothingat allindeed mamma you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for hermother you quite mistook mr darcy he only meant that there was notsuch a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the townwhich you must acknowledge to be truecertainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meetingwith many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are fewneighbourhoods larger i know we dine with fourandtwenty familiesnothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep hiscountenance his sister was less delicate and directed her eyes towardsmr darcy with a very expressive smile elizabeth for the sake ofsaying something that might turn her mothers thoughts now asked her ifcharlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming awayyes she called yesterday with her father what an agreeable man sirwilliam is mr bingley is not he so much the man of fashion sogenteel and easy he has always something to say to everybody thatis my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves veryimportant and never open their mouths quite mistake the matterdid charlotte dine with youno she would go home i fancy she was wanted about the mincepies formy part mr bingley i always keep servants that can do their own workmy daughters are brought up very differently but everybody is tojudge for themselves and the lucases are a very good sort of girlsi assure you it is a pity they are not handsome not that i thinkcharlotte so very plainbut then she is our particular friendshe seems a very pleasant young womanoh dear yes but you must own she is very plain lady lucas herselfhas often said so and envied me janes beauty i do not like to boastof my own child but to be sure janeone does not often see anybodybetter looking it is what everybody says i do not trust my ownpartiality when she was only fifteen there was a man at my brothergardiners in town so much in love with her that my sisterinlaw wassure he would make her an offer before we came away but however hedid not perhaps he thought her too young however he wrote some verseson her and very pretty they wereand so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently there hasbeen many a one i fancy overcome in the same way i wonder who firstdiscovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away lovei have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcyof a fine stout healthy love it may everything nourishes what isstrong already but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination iam convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely awaydarcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabethtremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again she longed tospeak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mrsbennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness tojane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy mr bingley wasunaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to becivil also and say what the occasion required she performed her partindeed without much graciousness but mrs bennet was satisfied andsoon afterwards ordered her carriage upon this signal the youngest ofher daughters put herself forward the two girls had been whispering toeach other during the whole visit and the result of it was that theyoungest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first cominginto the country to give a ball at netherfieldlydia was a stout wellgrown girl of fifteen with a fine complexionand goodhumoured countenance a favourite with her mother whoseaffection had brought her into public at an early age she had highanimal spirits and a sort of natural selfconsequence which theattention of the officers to whom her uncles good dinners and her owneasy manners recommended her had increased into assurance she was veryequal therefore to address mr bingley on the subject of the ball andabruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the mostshameful thing in the world if he did not keep it his answer to thissudden attack was delightful to their mothers eari am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and whenyour sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day ofthe ball but you would not wish to be dancing when she is illlydia declared herself satisfied oh yesit would be much better towait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carterwould be at meryton again and when you have given your ball sheadded i shall insist on their giving one also i shall tell colonelforster it will be quite a shame if he does notmrs bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returnedinstantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to theremarks of the two ladies and mr darcy the latter of whom howevercould not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite ofall miss bingleys witticisms on fine eyesthe day passed much as the day before had done mrs hurst and missbingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid whocontinued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joinedtheir party in the drawingroom the lootable however did not appearmr darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watchingthe progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention bymessages to his sister mr hurst and mr bingley were at piquet andmrs hurst was observing their gameelizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused inattending to what passed between darcy and his companion the perpetualcommendations of the lady either on his handwriting or on the evennessof his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcernwith which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and wasexactly in union with her opinion of eachhow delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letterhe made no answeryou write uncommonly fastyou are mistaken i write rather slowlyhow many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of ayear letters of business too how odious i should think themit is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of yourspray tell your sister that i long to see heri have already told her so once by your desirei am afraid you do not like your pen let me mend it for you i mendpens remarkably wellthank youbut i always mend my ownhow can you contrive to write so evenhe was silenttell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harpand pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautifullittle design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to missgrantleyswill you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again atpresent i have not room to do them justiceoh it is of no consequence i shall see her in january but do youalways write such charming long letters to her mr darcythey are generally long but whether always charming it is not for meto determineit is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter withease cannot write illthat will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried herbrother because he does not write with ease he studies too much forwords of four syllables do not you darcymy style of writing is very different from yoursoh cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless wayimaginable he leaves out half his words and blots the restmy ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express themby whichmeans my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondentsyour humility mr bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproofnothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance ofhumility it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes anindirect boastand which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modestythe indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects inwriting because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity ofthought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable youthink at least highly interesting the power of doing anything withquickness is always prized much by the possessor and often without anyattention to the imperfection of the performance when you told mrsbennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting netherfieldyou should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort ofpanegyric of compliment to yourselfand yet what is there so verylaudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary businessundone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone elsenay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all thefoolish things that were said in the morning and yet upon my honouri believe what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at thismoment at least therefore i did not assume the character of needlessprecipitance merely to show off before the ladiesi dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced thatyou would be gone with such celerity your conduct would be quite asdependent on chance as that of any man i know and if as you weremounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had betterstay till next week you would probably do it you would probably notgoand at another word might stay a monthyou have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr bingley didnot do justice to his own disposition you have shown him off now muchmore than he did himselfi am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what myfriend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper but i amafraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no meansintend for he would certainly think better of me if under such acircumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as icouldwould mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentionsas atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to itupon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak forhimselfyou expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call minebut which i have never acknowledged allowing the case however tostand according to your representation you must remember miss bennetthat the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house andthe delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offeringone argument in favour of its proprietyto yield readilyeasilyto the persuasion of a friend is no meritwith youto yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding ofeitheryou appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence offriendship and affection a regard for the requester would often makeone readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reasonone into it i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you havesupposed about mr bingley we may as well wait perhaps till thecircumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviourthereupon but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friendwhere one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of novery great moment should you think ill of that person for complyingwith the desire without waiting to be argued into itwill it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject toarrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is toappertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsistingbetween the partiesby all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars notforgetting their comparative height and size for that will have moreweight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of i assureyou that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison withmyself i should not pay him half so much deference i declare i do notknow a more awful object than darcy on particular occasions and inparticular places at his own house especially and of a sunday eveningwhen he has nothing to domr darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he wasrather offended and therefore checked her laugh miss bingley warmlyresented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with herbrother for talking such nonsensei see your design bingley said his friend you dislike an argumentand want to silence thisperhaps i do arguments are too much like disputes if you and missbennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be verythankful and then you may say whatever you like of mewhat you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and mrdarcy had much better finish his lettermr darcy took her advice and did finish his letterwhen that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabethfor an indulgence of some music miss bingley moved with some alacrityto the pianoforte and after a polite request that elizabeth would leadthe way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived sheseated herselfmrs hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employedelizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some musicbooksthat lay on the instrument how frequently mr darcys eyes were fixedon her she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object ofadmiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at herbecause he disliked her was still more strange she could only imaginehowever at last that she drew his notice because there was somethingmore wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than inany other person present the supposition did not pain her she likedhim too little to care for his approbationafter playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm bya lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr darcy drawing nearelizabeth said to herdo not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such anopportunity of dancing a reelshe smiled but made no answer he repeated the question with somesurprise at her silenceoh said she i heard you before but i could not immediatelydetermine what to say in reply you wanted me i know to say yesthat you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i alwaysdelight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person oftheir premeditated contempt i have therefore made up my mind to tellyou that i do not want to dance a reel at alland now despise me ifyou dareindeed i do not dareelizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at hisgallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in hermanner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcyhad never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her he reallybelieved that were it not for the inferiority of her connections heshould be in some dangermiss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her greatanxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received someassistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabethshe often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking oftheir supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliancei hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubberythe next day you will give your motherinlaw a few hints when thisdesirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongueand if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running afterofficers and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour tocheck that little something bordering on conceit and impertinencewhich your lady possesseshave you anything else to propose for my domestic felicityoh yes do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt phillips be placedin the gallery at pemberley put them next to your greatuncle thejudge they are in the same profession you know only in differentlines as for your elizabeths picture you must not have it taken forwhat painter could do justice to those beautiful eyesit would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but theircolour and shape and the eyelashes so remarkably fine might becopiedat that moment they were met from another walk by mrs hurst andelizabeth herselfi did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in someconfusion lest they had been overheardyou used us abominably ill answered mrs hurst running away withouttelling us that you were coming outthen taking the disengaged arm of mr darcy she left elizabeth to walkby herself the path just admitted three mr darcy felt their rudenessand immediately saidthis walk is not wide enough for our party we had better go into theavenuebut elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with themlaughingly answeredno no stay where you are you are charmingly grouped and appearto uncommon advantage the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting afourth goodbyeshe then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope ofbeing at home again in a day or two jane was already so much recoveredas to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that eveningwhen the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to hersister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into thedrawingroom where she was welcomed by her two friends with manyprofessions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeableas they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appearedtheir powers of conversation were considerable they could describe anentertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laughat their acquaintance with spiritbut when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first objectmiss bingleys eyes were instantly turned toward darcy and she hadsomething to say to him before he had advanced many steps he addressedhimself to miss bennet with a polite congratulation mr hurst alsomade her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffusenessand warmth remained for bingleys salutation he was full of joy andattention the first halfhour was spent in piling up the fire lest sheshould suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desireto the other side of the fireplace that she might be further fromthe door he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to anyoneelse elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with greatdelightwhen tea was over mr hurst reminded his sisterinlaw of thecardtablebut in vain she had obtained private intelligence that mrdarcy did not wish for cards and mr hurst soon found even his openpetition rejected she assured him that no one intended to play andthe silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her mrhurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of thesofas and go to sleep darcy took up a book miss bingley did the sameand mrs hurst principally occupied in playing with her braceletsand rings joined now and then in her brothers conversation with missbennetmiss bingleys attention was quite as much engaged in watching mrdarcys progress through his book as in reading her own and shewas perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page shecould not win him however to any conversation he merely answered herquestion and read on at length quite exhausted by the attempt to beamused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was thesecond volume of his she gave a great yawn and said how pleasantit is to spend an evening in this way i declare after all there is noenjoyment like reading how much sooner one tires of anything than of abook when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have notan excellent libraryno one made any reply she then yawned again threw aside her book andcast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement when hearingher brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenlytowards him and saidby the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance atnetherfield i would advise you before you determine on it to consultthe wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there arenot some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than apleasureif you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if hechooses before it beginsbut as for the ball it is quite a settledthing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall sendround my cardsi should like balls infinitely better she replied if they werecarried on in a different manner but there is something insufferablytedious in the usual process of such a meeting it would surely be muchmore rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order ofthe daymuch more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not benear so much like a ballmiss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards she got up and walkedabout the room her figure was elegant and she walked well butdarcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious inthe desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more andturning to elizabeth saidmiss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take aturn about the room i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting solong in one attitudeelizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately miss bingleysucceeded no less in the real object of her civility mr darcy lookedup he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter aselizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book he wasdirectly invited to join their party but he declined it observing thathe could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and downthe room together with either of which motives his joining them wouldinterfere what could he mean she was dying to know what could be hismeaningand asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand himnot at all was her answer but depend upon it he means to be severeon us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothingabout itmiss bingley however was incapable of disappointing mr darcy inanything and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of histwo motivesi have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soonas she allowed him to speak you either choose this method of passingthe evening because you are in each others confidence and have secretaffairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figuresappear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i would becompletely in your way and if the second i can admire you much betteras i sit by the fireoh shocking cried miss bingley i never heard anything soabominable how shall we punish him for such a speechnothing so easy if you have but the inclination said elizabeth wecan all plague and punish one another tease himlaugh at him intimateas you are you must know how it is to be donebut upon my honour i do not i do assure you that my intimacy hasnot yet taught me that tease calmness of manner and presence ofmind no no i feel he may defy us there and as to laughter we willnot expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without asubject mr darcy may hug himselfmr darcy is not to be laughed at cried elizabeth that is anuncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it wouldbe a great loss to me to have many such acquaintances i dearly love alaughmiss bingley said he has given me more credit than can bethe wisest and the best of mennay the wisest and best of theiractionsmay be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object inlife is a jokecertainly replied elizabeththere are such people but i hope iam not one of them i hope i never ridicule what is wise and goodfollies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i ownand i laugh at them whenever i can but these i suppose are preciselywhat you are withoutperhaps that is not possible for anyone but it has been the studyof my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strongunderstanding to ridiculesuch as vanity and prideyes vanity is a weakness indeed but pridewhere there is a realsuperiority of mind pride will be always under good regulationelizabeth turned away to hide a smileyour examination of mr darcy is over i presume said miss bingleyand pray what is the resulti am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect he owns ithimself without disguiseno said darcy i have made no such pretension i have faults enoughbut they are not i hope of understanding my temper i dare not vouchfor it is i believe too little yieldingcertainly too little for theconvenience of the world i cannot forget the follies and vices of othersso soon as i ought nor their offenses against myself my feelingsare not puffed about with every attempt to move them my temperwould perhaps be called resentful my good opinion once lost is lostforeverthat is a failing indeed cried elizabeth implacable resentmentis a shade in a character but you have chosen your fault well ireally cannot laugh at it you are safe from methere is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particularevila natural defect which not even the best education can overcomeand your defect is to hate everybodyand yours he replied with a smile is willfully to misunderstandthemdo let us have a little music cried miss bingley tired of aconversation in which she had no share louisa you will not mind mywaking mr hursther sister had not the smallest objection and the pianoforte wasopened and darcy after a few moments recollection was not sorry forit he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attentionin consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote thenext morning to their mother to beg that the carriage might be sent forthem in the course of the day but mrs bennet who had calculated onher daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday whichwould exactly finish janes week could not bring herself to receivethem with pleasure before her answer therefore was not propitious atleast not to elizabeths wishes for she was impatient to get home mrsbennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriagebefore tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if mr bingleyand his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare themvery well against staying longer however elizabeth was positivelyresolvednor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on thecontrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly longshe urged jane to borrow mr bingleys carriage immediately and atlength it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfieldthat morning should be mentioned and the request madethe communication excited many professions of concern and enough wassaid of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to workon jane and till the morrow their going was deferred miss bingley wasthen sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislikeof one sister much exceeded her affection for the otherthe master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go sosoon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not besafe for herthat she was not enough recovered but jane was firm whereshe felt herself to be rightto mr darcy it was welcome intelligenceelizabeth had been atnetherfield long enough she attracted him more than he likedand missbingley was uncivil to her and more teasing than usual to himselfhe wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admirationshould now escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hopeof influencing his felicity sensible that if such an idea had beensuggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weightin confirming or crushing it steady to his purpose he scarcely spoketen words to her through the whole of saturday and though they wereat one time left by themselves for halfanhour he adhered mostconscientiously to his book and would not even look at heron sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almostall took place miss bingleys civility to elizabeth increased at lastvery rapidly as well as her affection for jane and when they partedafter assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give herto see her either at longbourn or netherfield and embracing her mosttenderly she even shook hands with the former elizabeth took leave ofthe whole party in the liveliest of spiritsthey were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother mrs bennetwondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so muchtrouble and was sure jane would have caught cold again but theirfather though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure was reallyglad to see them he had felt their importance in the family circle theevening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much ofits animation and almost all its sense by the absence of jane andelizabeththey found mary as usual deep in the study of thoroughbass and humannature and had some extracts to admire and some new observations ofthreadbare morality to listen to catherine and lydia had informationfor them of a different sort much had been done and much had been saidin the regiment since the preceding wednesday several of the officershad dined lately with their uncle a private had been flogged and ithad actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be marriedi hope my dear said mr bennet to his wife as they were atbreakfast the next morning that you have ordered a good dinner todaybecause i have reason to expect an addition to our family partywho do you mean my dear i know of nobody that is coming i am sureunless charlotte lucas should happen to call inand i hope my dinnersare good enough for her i do not believe she often sees such at homethe person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a strangermrs bennets eyes sparkled a gentleman and a stranger it is mrbingley i am sure well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mrbingley butgood lord how unlucky there is not a bit of fish to begot today lydia my love ring the belli must speak to hill thismomentit is not mr bingley said her husband it is a person whom inever saw in the whole course of my lifethis roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of beingeagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at onceafter amusing himself some time with their curiosity he thus explainedabout a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight agoi answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiringearly attention it is from my cousin mr collins who when i am deadmay turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleasesoh my dear cried his wife i cannot bear to hear that mentionedpray do not talk of that odious man i do think it is the hardest thingin the world that your estate should be entailed away from your ownchildren and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long agoto do something or other about itjane and elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail theyhad often attempted to do it before but it was a subject on whichmrs bennet was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to railbitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family offive daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything aboutit certainly is a most iniquitous affair said mr bennet andnothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbournbut if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a littlesoftened by his manner of expressing himselfno that i am sure i shall not and i think it is very impertinent ofhim to write to you at all and very hypocritical i hate such falsefriends why could he not keep on quarreling with you as his father didbefore himwhy indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on thathead as you will hearhunsford near westerham kent th octoberdear sirthe disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honouredfather always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had themisfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the breach butfor some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing lest it mightseem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyonewith whom it had always pleased him to be at variancethere mrsbennetmy mind however is now made up on the subject for havingreceived ordination at easter i have been so fortunate as to bedistinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine debourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh whose bounty and beneficence haspreferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall bemy earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards herladyship and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies whichare instituted by the church of england as a clergyman moreover ifeel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace inall families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds iflatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable andthat the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estatewill be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject theoffered olivebranch i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being themeans of injuring your amiable daughters and beg leave to apologise forit as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possibleamendsbut of this hereafter if you should have no objection toreceive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waitingon you and your family monday november th by four oclock andshall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday seennightfollowing which i can do without any inconvenience as lady catherineis far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday providedthat some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the dayiremain dear sir with respectful compliments to your lady anddaughters your wellwisher and friendwilliam collinsat four oclock therefore we may expect this peacemaking gentleman said mr bennet as he folded up the letter he seems to be a mostconscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not willprove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be soindulgent as to let him come to us againthere is some sense in what he says about the girls however and ifhe is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person todiscourage himthough it is difficult said jane to guess in what way he can meanto make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to hiscreditelizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for ladycatherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and buryinghis parishioners whenever it were requiredhe must be an oddity i think said she i cannot make himoutthere is something very pompous in his styleand what can hemean by apologising for being next in the entailwe cannot suppose hewould help it if he couldcould he be a sensible man sirno my dear i think not i have great hopes of finding him quite thereverse there is a mixture of servility and selfimportance in hisletter which promises well i am impatient to see himin point of composition said mary the letter does not seemdefective the idea of the olivebranch perhaps is not wholly new yet ithink it is well expressedto catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in anydegree interesting it was next to impossible that their cousin shouldcome in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they hadreceived pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour as fortheir mother mr collinss letter had done away much of her illwilland she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure whichastonished her husband and daughtersmr collins was punctual to his time and was received with greatpoliteness by the whole family mr bennet indeed said little but theladies were ready enough to talk and mr collins seemed neither inneed of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself he was atall heavylooking young man of fiveandtwenty his air was grave andstately and his manners were very formal he had not been long seatedbefore he complimented mrs bennet on having so fine a family ofdaughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in thisinstance fame had fallen short of the truth and added that he didnot doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage thisgallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers but mrsbennet who quarreled with no compliments answered most readilyyou are very kind i am sure and i wish with all my heart it mayprove so for else they will be destitute enough things are settled sooddlyyou allude perhaps to the entail of this estateah sir i do indeed it is a grievous affair to my poor girls youmust confess not that i mean to find fault with you for such thingsi know are all chance in this world there is no knowing how estateswill go when once they come to be entailedi am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins andcould say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearingforward and precipitate but i can assure the young ladies that i comeprepared to admire them at present i will not say more but perhapswhen we are better acquaintedhe was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on eachother they were not the only objects of mr collinss admiration thehall the diningroom and all its furniture were examined and praisedand his commendation of everything would have touched mrs bennetsheart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as hisown future property the dinner too in its turn was highly admired andhe begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of itscooking was owing but he was set right there by mrs bennet whoassured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep agood cook and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen hebegged pardon for having displeased her in a softened tone she declaredherself not at all offended but he continued to apologise for about aquarter of an hourduring dinner mr bennet scarcely spoke at all but when the servantswere withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with hisguest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him toshine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness ladycatherine de bourghs attention to his wishes and consideration forhis comfort appeared very remarkable mr bennet could not have chosenbetter mr collins was eloquent in her praise the subject elevated himto more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspecthe protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour ina person of ranksuch affability and condescension as he had himselfexperienced from lady catherine she had been graciously pleased toapprove of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour ofpreaching before her she had also asked him twice to dine at rosingsand had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool ofquadrille in the evening lady catherine was reckoned proud by manypeople he knew but he had never seen anything but affability in hershe had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman shemade not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of theneighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week ortwo to visit his relations she had even condescended to advise him tomarry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion and hadonce paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectlyapproved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafedto suggest some herselfsome shelves in the closet up stairsthat is all very proper and civil i am sure said mrs bennet andi dare say she is a very agreeable woman it is a pity that great ladiesin general are not more like her does she live near you sirthe garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lanefrom rosings park her ladyships residencei think you said she was a widow sir has she any familyshe has only one daughter the heiress of rosings and of veryextensive propertyah said mrs bennet shaking her head then she is better off thanmany girls and what sort of young lady is she is she handsomeshe is a most charming young lady indeed lady catherine herself saysthat in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to thehandsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marksthe young lady of distinguished birth she is unfortunately of a sicklyconstitution which has prevented her from making that progress in manyaccomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of as i aminformed by the lady who superintended her education and who stillresides with them but she is perfectly amiable and often condescendsto drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponieshas she been presented i do not remember her name among the ladies atcourther indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in townand by that means as i told lady catherine one day has deprived thebritish court of its brightest ornament her ladyship seemed pleasedwith the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion tooffer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptableto ladies i have more than once observed to lady catherine thather charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess and that the mostelevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned byher these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship andit is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound topayyou judge very properly said mr bennet and it is happy for youthat you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy may i askwhether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of themoment or are the result of previous studythey arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though isometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegantcompliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions i always wish togive them as unstudied an air as possiblemr bennets expectations were fully answered his cousin was as absurdas he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoymentmaintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenanceand except in an occasional glance at elizabeth requiring no partnerin his pleasureby teatime however the dose had been enough and mr bennet was gladto take his guest into the drawingroom again and when tea was overglad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies mr collins readilyassented and a book was produced but on beholding it for everythingannounced it to be from a circulating library he started back andbegging pardon protested that he never read novels kitty stared athim and lydia exclaimed other books were produced and after somedeliberation he chose fordyces sermons lydia gaped as he opened thevolume and before he had with very monotonous solemnity read threepages she interrupted him withdo you know mamma that my uncle phillips talks of turning awayrichard and if he does colonel forster will hire him my aunt told meso herself on saturday i shall walk to meryton tomorrow to hear moreabout it and to ask when mr denny comes back from townlydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue but mrcollins much offended laid aside his book and saidi have often observed how little young ladies are interested by booksof a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit it amazesme i confess for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous tothem as instruction but i will no longer importune my young cousinthen turning to mr bennet he offered himself as his antagonist atbackgammon mr bennet accepted the challenge observing that he actedvery wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusementsmrs bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydiasinterruption and promised that it should not occur again if he wouldresume his book but mr collins after assuring them that he bore hisyoung cousin no illwill and should never resent her behaviour as anyaffront seated himself at another table with mr bennet and preparedfor backgammonmr collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature hadbeen but little assisted by education or society the greatest partof his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate andmiserly father and though he belonged to one of the universities hehad merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any usefulacquaintance the subjection in which his father had brought him up hadgiven him originally great humility of manner but it was now agood deal counteracted by the selfconceit of a weak head living inretirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpectedprosperity a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine debourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant and the respect whichhe felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patronessmingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as aclergyman and his right as a rector made him altogether a mixture ofpride and obsequiousness selfimportance and humilityhaving now a good house and a very sufficient income he intended tomarry and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he hada wife in view as he meant to choose one of the daughters if he foundthem as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common reportthis was his plan of amendsof atonementfor inheriting their fathersestate and he thought it an excellent one full of eligibility andsuitableness and excessively generous and disinterested on his ownparthis plan did not vary on seeing them miss bennets lovely faceconfirmed his views and established all his strictest notions of whatwas due to seniority and for the first evening she was his settledchoice the next morning however made an alteration for in aquarter of an hours teteatete with mrs bennet before breakfast aconversation beginning with his parsonagehouse and leading naturallyto the avowal of his hopes that a mistress might be found for it atlongbourn produced from her

did not know of any prepossession hereldest daughter she must just mentionshe felt it incumbent on herto hint was likely to be very soon engagedmr collins had only to change from jane to elizabethand it was soondonedone while mrs bennet was stirring the fire elizabeth equallynext to jane in birth and beauty succeeded her of coursemrs bennet treasured up the hint and trusted that she might soon havetwo daughters married and the man whom she could not bear to speak ofthe day before was now high in her good graceslydias intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten every sisterexcept mary agreed to go with her and mr collins was to attend themat the request of mr bennet who was most anxious to get rid of himand have his library to himself for thither mr collins had followedhim after breakfast and there he would continue nominally engaged withone of the largest folios in the collection but really talking to mrbennet with little cessation of his house and garden at hunsford suchdoings discomposed mr bennet exceedingly in his library he had beenalways sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as he toldelizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of thehouse he was used to be free from them there his civility thereforewas most prompt in inviting mr collins to join his daughters in theirwalk and mr collins being in fact much better fitted for a walkerthan a reader was extremely pleased to close his large book and goin pompous nothings on his side and civil assents on that of hiscousins their time passed till they entered meryton the attention ofthe younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him their eyes wereimmediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers andnothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin ina shop window could recall thembut the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whomthey had never seen before of most gentlemanlike appearance walkingwith another officer on the other side of the way the officer wasthe very mr denny concerning whose return from london lydia cameto inquire and he bowed as they passed all were struck with thestrangers air all wondered who he could be and kitty and lydiadetermined if possible to find out led the way across the street underpretense of wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunatelyhad just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back hadreached the same spot mr denny addressed them directly and entreatedpermission to introduce his friend mr wickham who had returned withhim the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted acommission in their corps this was exactly as it should be for theyoung man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charminghis appearance was greatly in his favour he had all the best part ofbeauty a fine countenance a good figure and very pleasing addressthe introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readinessof conversationa readiness at the same time perfectly correct andunassuming and the whole party were still standing and talking togethervery agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcyand bingley were seen riding down the street on distinguishing theladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them andbegan the usual civilities bingley was the principal spokesman andmiss bennet the principal object he was then he said on his way tolongbourn on purpose to inquire after her mr darcy corroboratedit with a bow and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyeson elizabeth when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of thestranger and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as theylooked at each other was all astonishment at the effect of the meetingboth changed colour one looked white the other red mr wickhamafter a few moments touched his hata salutation which mr darcy justdeigned to return what could be the meaning of it it was impossible toimagine it was impossible not to long to knowin another minute mr bingley but without seeming to have noticed whatpassed took leave and rode on with his friendmr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door ofmr phillips house and then made their bows in spite of miss lydiaspressing entreaties that they should come in and even in spite ofmrs phillipss throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding theinvitationmrs phillips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldestfrom their recent absence were particularly welcome and she waseagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which astheir own carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothingabout if she had not happened to see mr joness shopboy in thestreet who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts tonetherfield because the miss bennets were come away when her civilitywas claimed towards mr collins by janes introduction of him shereceived him with her very best politeness which he returned withas much more apologising for his intrusion without any previousacquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himselfhowever might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies whointroduced him to her notice mrs phillips was quite awed by such anexcess of good breeding but her contemplation of one stranger was soonput to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other of whomhowever she could only tell her nieces what they already knew thatmr denny had brought him from london and that he was to have alieutenants commission in the shire she had been watching him thelast hour she said as he walked up and down the street and had mrwickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued theoccupation but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of theofficers who in comparison with the stranger were become stupiddisagreeable fellows some of them were to dine with the phillipsesthe next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mrwickham and give him an invitation also if the family from longbournwould come in the evening this was agreed to and mrs phillipsprotested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lotterytickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwards the prospect of suchdelights was very cheering and they parted in mutual good spirits mrcollins repeated his apologies in quitting the room and was assuredwith unwearying civility that they were perfectly needlessas they walked home elizabeth related to jane what she had seen passbetween the two gentlemen but though jane would have defended eitheror both had they appeared to be in the wrong she could no more explainsuch behaviour than her sistermr collins on his return highly gratified mrs bennet by admiringmrs phillipss manners and politeness he protested that except ladycatherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant womanfor she had not only received him with the utmost civility but evenpointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening althoughutterly unknown to her before something he supposed might beattributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with somuch attention in the whole course of his lifeas no objection was made to the young peoples engagement with theiraunt and all mr collinss scruples of leaving mr and mrs bennet fora single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coachconveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton andthe girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawingroomthat mr wickham had accepted their uncles invitation and was then inthe housewhen this information was given and they had all taken their seats mrcollins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so muchstruck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared hemight almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfastparlour at rosings a comparison that did not at first convey muchgratification but when mrs phillips understood from him whatrosings was and who was its proprietorwhen she had listened to thedescription of only one of lady catherines drawingrooms and foundthat the chimneypiece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt allthe force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparisonwith the housekeepers roomin describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansionwith occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode andthe improvements it was receiving he was happily employed until thegentlemen joined them and he found in mrs phillips a very attentivelistener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what sheheard and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours assoon as she could to the girls who could not listen to their cousinand who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument and examinetheir own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece theinterval of waiting appeared very long it was over at last howeverthe gentlemen did approach and when mr wickham walked into the roomelizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinkingof him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admirationthe officers of the shire were in general a very creditablegentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party butmr wickham was as far beyond them all in person countenance air andwalk as they were superior to the broadfaced stuffy uncle phillipsbreathing port wine who followed them into the roommr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye wasturned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seatedhimself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell intoconversation though it was only on its being a wet night made her feelthat the commonest dullest most threadbare topic might be renderedinteresting by the skill of the speakerwith such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr wickham and theofficers mr collins seemed to sink into insignificance to the youngladies he certainly was nothing but he had still at intervals a kindlistener in mrs phillips and was by her watchfulness most abundantlysupplied with coffee and muffin when the cardtables were placed hehad the opportunity of obliging her in turn by sitting down to whisti know little of the game at present said he but i shall be gladto improve myself for in my situation in life mrs phillips was veryglad for his compliance but could not wait for his reasonmr wickham did not play at whist and with ready delight was hereceived at the other table between elizabeth and lydia at first thereseemed danger of lydias engrossing him entirely for she was a mostdetermined talker but being likewise extremely fond of lottery ticketsshe soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making betsand exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particularallowing for the common demands of the game mr wickham was thereforeat leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hearhim though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to betoldthe history of his acquaintance with mr darcy she dared noteven mention that gentleman her curiosity however was unexpectedlyrelieved mr wickham began the subject himself he inquired how farnetherfield was from meryton and after receiving her answer asked ina hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying thereabout a month said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subjectdrop added he is a man of very large property in derbyshire iunderstandyes replied mr wickham his estate there is a noble one a clearten thousand per annum you could not have met with a person morecapable of giving you certain information on that head than myself fori have been connected with his family in a particular manner from myinfancyelizabeth could not but look surprisedyou may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion afterseeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meetingyesterday are you much acquainted with mr darcyas much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth very warmly i havespent four days in the same house with him and i think him verydisagreeablei have no right to give my opinion said wickham as to his beingagreeable or otherwise i am not qualified to form one i have known himtoo long and too well to be a fair judge it is impossible for meto be impartial but i believe your opinion of him would in generalastonishand perhaps you would not express it quite so stronglyanywhere else here you are in your own familyupon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house inthe neighbourhood except netherfield he is not at all liked inhertfordshire everybody is disgusted with his pride you will not findhim more favourably spoken of by anyonei cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham after a shortinterruption that he or that any man should not be estimated beyondtheir deserts but with him i believe it does not often happen theworld is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by hishigh and imposing manners and sees him only as he chooses to be seeni should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be anilltempered man wickham only shook his headi wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he islikely to be in this country much longeri do not at all know but i heard nothing of his going away when iwas at netherfield i hope your plans in favour of the shire willnot be affected by his being in the neighbourhoodoh noit is not for me to be driven away by mr darcy if hewishes to avoid seeing me he must go we are not on friendly termsand it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason foravoiding him but what i might proclaim before all the world a senseof very great illusage and most painful regrets at his being what heis his father miss bennet the late mr darcy was one of the best menthat ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and i can neverbe in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul bya thousand tender recollections his behaviour to myself has beenscandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him anything andeverything rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing thememory of his fatherelizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened withall her heart but the delicacy of it prevented further inquirymr wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton theneighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all thathe had yet seen and speaking of the latter with gentle but veryintelligible gallantryit was the prospect of constant society and good society he addedwhich was my chief inducement to enter the shire i knew it to bea most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted mefurther by his account of their present quarters and the very greatattentions and excellent acquaintances meryton had procured themsociety i own is necessary to me i have been a disappointed man andmy spirits will not bear solitude i must have employment and societya military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances havenow made it eligible the church ought to have been my professioniwas brought up for the church and i should at this time have been inpossession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman wewere speaking of just nowindeedyesthe late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the bestliving in his gift he was my godfather and excessively attached to mei cannot do justice to his kindness he meant to provide for me amplyand thought he had done it but when the living fell it was givenelsewheregood heavens cried elizabeth but how could that be how could hiswill be disregarded why did you not seek legal redressthere was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as togive me no hope from law a man of honour could not have doubted theintention but mr darcy chose to doubt itor to treat it as a merelyconditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claimto it by extravagance imprudencein short anything or nothing certainit is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i wasof an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and noless certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really doneanything to deserve to lose it i have a warm unguarded temper andi may have spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely i canrecall nothing worse but the fact is that we are very different sortof men and that he hates methis is quite shocking he deserves to be publicly disgracedsome time or other he will bebut it shall not be by me till ican forget his father i can never defy or expose himelizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him handsomer thanever as he expressed thembut what said she after a pause can have been his motive what canhave induced him to behave so cruellya thorough determined dislike of mea dislike which i cannot butattribute in some measure to jealousy had the late mr darcy liked meless his son might have borne with me better but his fathers uncommonattachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life he hadnot a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stoodthe sortof preference which was often given mei had not thought mr darcy so bad as thisthough i have never likedhim i had not thought so very ill of him i had supposed him to bedespising his fellowcreatures in general but did not suspect him ofdescending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity asthisafter a few minutes reflection however she continued i doremember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability ofhis resentments of his having an unforgiving temper his dispositionmust be dreadfuli will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham i can hardlybe just to himelizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed totreat in such a manner the godson the friend the favourite of hisfather she could have added a young man too like you whose verycountenance may vouch for your being amiablebut she contented herselfwith and one too who had probably been his companion from childhoodconnected together as i think you
