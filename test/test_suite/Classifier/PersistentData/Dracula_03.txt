commanding eminence watch the wide sweep ofsea visible to the north and east called attention to a sudden show ofmarestails high in the sky to the northwest the wind was thenblowing from the southwest in the mild degree which in barometricallanguage is ranked no  light breeze the coastguard on duty at oncemade report and one old fisherman who for more than half a century haskept watch on weather signs from the east cliff foretold in an emphaticmanner the coming of a sudden storm the approach of sunset was so verybeautiful so grand in its masses of splendidlycoloured clouds thatthere was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the oldchurchyard to enjoy the beauty before the sun dipped below the blackmass of kettleness standing boldly athwart the western sky itsdownward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunsetcolourflamepurple pink green violet and all the tints of gold with here andthere masses not large but of seemingly absolute blackness in allsorts of shapes as well outlined as colossal silhouettes theexperience was not lost on the painters and doubtless some of thesketches of the prelude to the great storm will grace the r a and ri walls in may next more than one captain made up his mind then andthere that his cobble or his mule as they term the differentclasses of boats would remain in the harbour till the storm had passedthe wind fell away entirely during the evening and at midnight therewas a dead calm a sultry heat and that prevailing intensity which onthe approach of thunder affects persons of a sensitive nature therewere but few lights in sight at sea for even the coasting steamerswhich usually hug the shore so closely kept well to seaward and butfew fishingboats were in sight the only sail noticeable was a foreignschooner with all sails set which was seemingly going westwards thefoolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme forcomment whilst she remained in sight and efforts were made to signalher to reduce sail in face of her danger before the night shut down shewas seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulatingswell of the sea    as idle as a painted ship upon a painted oceanshortly before ten oclock the stillness of the air grew quiteoppressive and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheepinland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard and theband on the pier with its lively french air was like a discord in thegreat harmony of natures silence a little after midnight came astrange sound from over the sea and high overhead the air began tocarry a strange faint hollow boomingthen without warning the tempest broke with a rapidity which at thetime seemed incredible and even afterwards is impossible to realizethe whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed the waves rose ingrowing fury each overtopping its fellow till in a very few minutesthe lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monsterwhitecrested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up theshelving cliffs others broke over the piers and with their spume sweptthe lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pierof whitby harbour the wind roared like thunder and blew with suchforce that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feetor clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions it was found necessaryto clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers or else thefatalities of the night would have been increased manifold to add tothe difficulties and dangers of the time masses of seafog camedrifting inlandwhite wet clouds which swept by in ghostly fashionso dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort ofimagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea weretouching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death and manya one shuddered as the wreaths of seamist swept by at times the mistcleared and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of thelightning which now came thick and fast followed by such sudden pealsof thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shockof the footsteps of the stormsome of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and ofabsorbing interestthe sea running mountains high threw skywards witheach wave mighty masses of white foam which the tempest seemed tosnatch at and whirl away into space here and there a fishingboat witha rag of sail running madly for shelter before the blast now and againthe white wings of a stormtossed seabird on the summit of the eastcliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment but had not yet beentried the officers in charge of it got it into working order and inthe pauses of the inrushing mist swept with it the surface of the seaonce or twice its service was most effective as when a fishingboatwith gunwale under water rushed into the harbour able by the guidanceof the sheltering light to avoid the danger of dashing against thepiers as each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout ofjoy from the mass of people on shore a shout which for a moment seemedto cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rushbefore long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schoonerwith all sails set apparently the same vessel which had been noticedearlier in the evening the wind had by this time backed to the eastand there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as theyrealized the terrible danger in which she now was between her and theport lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from timeto time suffered and with the wind blowing from its present quarterit would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of theharbour it was now nearly the hour of high tide but the waves were sogreat that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almostvisible and the schooner with all sails set was rushing with suchspeed that in the words of one old salt she must fetch up somewhereif it was only in hell then came another rush of seafog greater thanany hithertoa mass of dank mist which seemed to close on all thingslike a grey pall and left available to men only the organ of hearingfor the roar of the tempest and the crash of the thunder and thebooming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louderthan before the rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbourmouth across the east pier where the shock was expected and men waitedbreathless the wind suddenly shifted to the northeast and the remnantof the seafog melted in the blast and then mirabile dictu betweenthe piers leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speedswept the strange schooner before the blast with all sail set andgained the safety of the harbour the searchlight followed her and ashudder ran through all who saw her for lashed to the helm was acorpse with drooping head which swung horribly to and fro at eachmotion of the ship no other form could be seen on deck at all a greatawe came on all as they realised that the ship as if by a miracle hadfound the harbour unsteered save by the hand of a dead man howeverall took place more quickly than it takes to write these words theschooner paused not but rushing across the harbour pitched herself onthat accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and manystorms into the southeast corner of the pier jutting under the eastcliff known locally as tate hill pierthere was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up onthe sand heap every spar rope and stay was strained and some of thetophammer came crashing down but strangest of all the very instantthe shore was touched an immense dog sprang up on deck from below asif shot up by the concussion and running forward jumped from the bowon the sand making straight for the steep cliff where the churchyardhangs over the laneway to the east pier so steeply that some of the flattombstonesthruffsteans or throughstones as they call them inthe whitby vernacularactually project over where the sustaining cliffhas fallen away it disappeared in the darkness which seemedintensified just beyond the focus of the searchlightit so happened that there was no one at the moment on tate hill pier asall those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or wereout on the heights above thus the coastguard on duty on the easternside of the harbour who at once ran down to the little pier was thefirst to climb on board the men working the searchlight after scouringthe entrance of the harbour without seeing anything then turned thelight on the derelict and kept it there the coastguard ran aft andwhen he came beside the wheel bent over to examine it and recoiled atonce as though under some sudden emotion this seemed to pique generalcuriosity and quite a number of people began to run it is a good wayround from the west cliff by the drawbridge to tate hill pier but yourcorrespondent is a fairly good runner and came well ahead of the crowdwhen i arrived however i found already assembled on the pier a crowdwhom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board by thecourtesy of the chief boatman i was as your correspondent permittedto climb on deck and was one of a small group who saw the dead seamanwhilst actually lashed to the wheelit was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised or even awed fornot often can such a sight have been seen the man was simply fastenedby his hands tied one over the other to a spoke of the wheel betweenthe inner hand and the wood was a crucifix the set of beads on which itwas fastened being around both wrists and wheel and all kept fast bythe binding cords the poor fellow may have been seated at one time butthe flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder ofthe wheel and dragged him to and fro so that the cords with which hewas tied had cut the flesh to the bone accurate note was made of thestate of things and a doctorsurgeon j m caffyn of  east elliotplacewho came immediately after me declared after makingexamination that the man must have been dead for quite two days in hispocket was a bottle carefully corked empty save for a little roll ofpaper which proved to be the addendum to the log the coastguard saidthe man must have tied up his own hands fastening the knots with histeeth the fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save somecomplications later on in the admiralty court for coastguards cannotclaim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on aderelict already however the legal tongues are wagging and one younglaw student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are alreadycompletely sacrificed his property being held in contravention of thestatutes of mortmain since the tiller as emblemship if not proof ofdelegated possession is held in a dead hand it is needless to saythat the dead steersman has been reverently removed from the place wherehe held his honourable watch and ward till deatha steadfastness asnoble as that of the young casabiancaand placed in the mortuary toawait inquestalready the sudden storm is passing and its fierceness is abatingcrowds are scattering homeward and the sky is beginning to redden overthe yorkshire wolds i shall send in time for your next issue furtherdetails of the derelict ship which found her way so miraculously intoharbour in the stormwhitby augustthe sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in thestorm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself itturns out that the schooner is a russian from varna and is called thedemeter she is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand with only asmall amount of cargoa number of great wooden boxes filled with mouldthis cargo was consigned to a whitby solicitor mr s f billington of the crescent who this morning went aboard and formally tookpossession of the goods consigned to him the russian consul tooacting for the charterparty took formal possession of the ship andpaid all harbour dues etc nothing is talked about here today exceptthe strange coincidence the officials of the board of trade have beenmost exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made withexisting regulations as the matter is to be a nine days wonder theyare evidently determined that there shall be no cause of aftercomplaint a good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog whichlanded when the ship struck and more than a few of the members of thes p c a which is very strong in whitby have tried to befriend theanimal to the general disappointment however it was not to be foundit seems to have disappeared entirely from the town it may be that itwas frightened and made its way on to the moors where it is stillhiding in terror there are some who look with dread on such apossibility lest later on it should in itself become a danger for itis evidently a fierce brute early this morning a large dog a halfbredmastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to tate hill pier was founddead in the roadway opposite to its masters yard it had been fightingand manifestly had had a savage opponent for its throat was torn awayand its belly was slit open as if with a savage claw                                   laterby the kindness of the board of trade inspector i have beenpermitted to look over the logbook of the demeter which was in orderup to within three days but contained nothing of special interestexcept as to facts of missing men the greatest interest however iswith regard to the paper found in the bottle which was today producedat the inquest and a more strange narrative than the two between themunfold it has not been my lot to come across as there is no motive forconcealment i am permitted to use them and accordingly send you arescript simply omitting technical details of seamanship andsupercargo it almost seems as though the captain had been seized withsome kind of mania before he had got well into blue water and thatthis had developed persistently throughout the voyage of course mystatement must be taken cum grano since i am writing from thedictation of a clerk of the russian consul who kindly translated forme time being short                         log of the demetervarna to whitbywritten  july things so strange happening that i shall keepaccurate note henceforth till we land

he said that in his watch he had been shelteringbehind the deckhouse as there was a rainstorm when he saw a tallthin man who was not like any of the crew come up the companionwayand go along the deck forward and disappear he followed cautiouslybut when he got to bows found no one and the hatchways were all closedhe was in a panic of superstitious fear and i am afraid the panic mayspread to allay it i shall today search entire ship carefully fromstem to stern                                   later in the day i got together the whole crew and told them as theyevidently thought there was some one in the ship we would search fromstem to stern first mate angry said it was folly and to yield to suchfoolish ideas would demoralise the men said he would engage to keepthem out of trouble with a handspike i let him take the helm while therest began thorough search all keeping abreast with lanterns we leftno corner unsearched as there were only the big wooden boxes therewere no odd corners

in somewherenot having power to work sails have to run before wind dare not loweras could not raise them again we seem to be drifting to some terribledoom mate now more demoralised than either of men his stronger natureseems to have worked inwardly against himself men are beyond fearworking stolidly and patiently with minds made up to worst they arerussian he roumanian                                    august midnightwoke up from few minutes sleep by hearing a cryseemingly outside my port could see nothing in fog rushed on deck andran against mate tells me heard cry and ran but no sign of man onwatch one more gone lord help us mate says we must be past straitsof dover as in a moment of fog lifting he saw north foreland just ashe heard the man cry out if so we are now off in the north sea andonly god can guide us in the fog which seems to move with us and godseems to have deserted us                                    augustat midnight i went to relieve the man at the wheel andwhen i got to it found no one there the wind was steady and as we ranbefore it there was no yawing i dared not leave it so shouted for themate after a few seconds he rushed up on deck in his flannels helooked wildeyed and haggard and i greatly fear his reason has givenway he came close to me and whispered hoarsely with his mouth to myear as though fearing the very air might hear it is here i knowit now on the watch last night i saw it like a man tall and thinand ghastly pale it was in the bows and looking out i crept behindit and gave it my knife but the knife went through it empty as theair and as he spoke he took his knife and drove it savagely intospace then he went on but it is here and ill find it it is in thehold perhaps in one of those boxes ill unscrew them one by one andsee you work the helm and with a warning look and his finger on hislip he went below there was springing up a choppy wind and i couldnot leave the helm i saw him come out on deck again with a toolchestand a lantern and go down the forward hatchway he is mad starkraving mad and its no use my trying to stop him he cant hurt thosebig boxes they are invoiced as clay and to pull them about is asharmless a thing as he can do so here i stay and mind the helm andwrite these notes i can only trust in god and wait till the fog clearsthen if i cant steer to any harbour with the wind that is i shall cutdown sails and lie by and signal for help                                   it is nearly all over now just as i was beginning to hope that the matewould come out calmerfor i heard him knocking away at something in thehold and work is good for himthere came up the hatchway a suddenstartled scream which made my blood run cold and up on the deck hecame as if shot from a guna raging madman with his eyes rolling andhis face convulsed with fear save me save me he cried and thenlooked round on the blanket of fog his horror turned to despair and ina steady voice he said you had better come too captain before it istoo late he is there i know the secret now the sea will save mefrom him and it is all that is left before i could say a word ormove forward to seize him he sprang on the bulwark and deliberatelythrew himself into the sea i suppose i know the secret too now it wasthis madman who had got rid of the men one by one and now he hasfollowed them himself god help me how am i to account for all thesehorrors when i get to port when i get to port will that ever be                                    auguststill fog which the sunrise cannot pierce i know there issunrise because i am a sailor why else i know not i dared not gobelow i dared not leave the helm so here all night i stayed and inthe dimness of the night i saw ithim god forgive me but the mate wasright to jump overboard it was better to die like a man to die like asailor in blue water no man can object but i am captain and i must notleave my ship but i shall baffle this fiend or monster for i shall tiemy hands to the wheel when my strength begins to fail and along withthem i shall tie that which heitdare not touch and then come goodwind or foul i shall save my soul and my honour as a captain i amgrowing weaker and the night is coming on if he can look me in theface again i may not have time to act if we are wrecked mayhapthis bottle may be found and those who find it may understand if not well then all men shall know that i have been true to my trust godand the blessed virgin and the saints help a poor ignorant soul tryingto do his duty                                   of course the verdict was an open one there is no evidence to adduceand whether or not the man himself committed the murders there is nownone to say the folk here hold almost universally that the captain issimply a hero and he is to be given a public funeral already it isarranged that his body is to be taken with a train of boats up the eskfor a piece and then brought back to tate hill pier and up the abbeysteps for he is to be buried in the churchyard on the cliff the ownersof more than a hundred boats have already given in their names aswishing to follow him to the graveno trace has ever been found of the great dog at which there is muchmourning for with public opinion in its present state he would ibelieve be adopted by the town tomorrow will see the funeral and sowill end this one more mystery of the sea augustlucy was very restless all night and i too could notsleep the storm was fearful and as it boomed loudly among thechimneypots it made me shudder when a sharp puff came it seemed to belike a distant gun strangely enough lucy did not wake but she got uptwice and dressed herself fortunately each time i awoke in time andmanaged to undress her without waking her and got her back to bed itis a very strange thing this sleepwalking for as soon as her will isthwarted in any physical way her intention if there be anydisappears and she yields herself almost exactly to the routine of herlifeearly in the morning we both got up and went down to the harbour to seeif anything had happened in the night there were very few people aboutand though the sun was bright and the air clear and fresh the biggrimlooking waves that seemed dark themselves because the foam thattopped them was like snow forced themselves in through the narrow mouthof the harbourlike a bullying man going through a crowd somehow ifelt glad that jonathan was not on the sea last night but on land butoh is he on land or sea where is he and how i am getting fearfullyanxious about him if i only knew what to do and could do anything                                    augustthe funeral of the poor seacaptain today was mosttouching every boat in the harbour seemed to be there and the coffinwas carried by captains all the way from tate hill pier up to thechurchyard lucy came with me and we went early to our old seat whilstthe cortège of boats went up the river to the viaduct and came downagain we had a lovely view and saw the procession nearly all the waythe poor fellow was laid to rest quite near our seat so that we stood onit when the time came and saw everything poor lucy seemed much upsetshe was restless and uneasy all the time and i cannot but think thather dreaming at night is telling on her she is quite odd in one thingshe will not admit to me that there is any cause for restlessness or ifthere be she does not understand it herself there is an additionalcause in that poor old mr swales was found dead this morning on ourseat his neck being broken he had evidently as the doctor saidfallen back in the seat in some sort of fright for there was a look offear and horror on his face that the men said made them shudder poordear old man perhaps he had seen death with his dying eyes lucy is sosweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely than otherpeople do just now she was quite upset by a little thing which i didnot much heed though i am myself very fond of animals one of the menwho came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dogthe dog is always with him they are both quiet persons and i never sawthe man angry nor heard the dog bark during the service the dog wouldnot come to its master who was on the seat with us but kept a fewyards off barking and howling its master spoke to it gently and thenharshly and then angrily but it would neither come nor cease to make anoise it was in a sort of fury with its eyes savage and all its hairsbristling out like a cats tail when puss is on the warpath finallythe man too got angry and jumped down and kicked the dog and thentook it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it onthe tombstone on which the seat is fixed the moment it touched thestone the poor thing became quiet and fell all into a tremble it didnot try to get away but crouched down quivering and cowering and wasin such a pitiable state of terror that i tried though without effectto comfort it lucy was full of pity too but she did not attempt totouch the dog but looked at it in an agonised sort of way i greatlyfear that she is of too supersensitive a nature to go through the worldwithout trouble she will be dreaming of this tonight i am sure thewhole agglomeration of thingsthe ship steered into port by a deadman his attitude tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads thetouching funeral the dog now furious and now in terrorwill allafford material for her dreamsi think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out physically so ishall take her for a long walk by the cliffs to robin hoods bay andback she ought not to have much inclination for sleepwalking thensame day  oclock p moh but i am tired if it were not that ihad made my diary a duty i should not open it tonight we had a lovelywalk lucy after a while was in gay spirits owing i think to somedear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouseand frightened the wits out of us i believe we forgot everythingexcept of course personal fear and it seemed to wipe the slate cleanand give us a fresh start we had a capital severe tea at robin hoodsbay in a sweet little oldfashioned inn with a bowwindow right overthe seaweedcovered rocks of the strand i believe we should haveshocked the new woman with our appetites men are more tolerant blessthem then we walked home with some or rather many stoppages to restand with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls lucy wasreally tired and we intended to creep off to bed as soon as we couldthe young curate came in however and mrs westenra asked him to stayfor supper lucy and i had both a fight for it with the dusty miller iknow it was a hard fight on my part and i am quite heroic i think thatsome day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up a newclass of curates who dont take supper no matter how they may bepressed to and who will know when girls are tired lucy is asleep andbreathing softly she has more colour in her cheeks than usual andlooks oh so sweet if mr holmwood fell in love with her seeing heronly in the drawingroom i wonder what he would say if he saw her nowsome of the new women writers will some day start an idea that men andwomen should be allowed to see each other asleep before proposing oraccepting but i suppose the new woman wont condescend in future toaccept she will do the proposing herself and a nice job she will makeof it too theres some consolation in that i am so happy tonightbecause dear lucy seems better i really believe she has turned thecorner and that we are over her troubles with dreaming i should bequite happy if i only knew if jonathan god bless and keep him                                    august  a mdiary again no sleep now so i may as well writei am too agitated to sleep we have had such an adventure such anagonising experience i fell asleep as soon as i had closed my diarysuddenly i became broad awake and sat up with a horrible sense of fearupon me and of some feeling of emptiness around me the room was darkso i could not see lucys bed i stole across and felt for her the bedwas empty i lit a match and found that she was not in the room thedoor was shut but not locked as i had left it i feared to wake hermother who has been more than usually ill lately so threw on someclothes and got ready to look for her as i was leaving the room itstruck me that the clothes she wore might give me some clue to herdreaming intention dressinggown would mean house dress outsidedressinggown and dress were both in their places thank god i saidto myself she cannot be far as she is only in her nightdress i randownstairs and looked in the sittingroom not there then i looked inall the other open rooms of the house with an evergrowing fearchilling my heart finally i came to the hall door and found it open itwas not wide open but the catch of the lock had not caught the peopleof the house are careful to lock the door every night so i feared thatlucy must have gone out as she was there was no time to think of whatmight happen a vague overmastering fear obscured all details i took abig heavy shawl and ran out the clock was striking one as i was in thecrescent and there was not a soul in sight i ran along the northterrace but could see no sign of the white figure which i expected atthe edge of the west cliff above the pier i looked across the harbour tothe east cliff in the hope or feari dont know whichof seeing lucyin our favourite seat there was a bright full moon with heavy blackdriving clouds which threw the whole scene into a fleeting diorama oflight and shade as they sailed across for a moment or two i could seenothing as the shadow of a cloud obscured st marys church and allaround it then as the cloud passed i could see the ruins of the abbeycoming into view and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp asa swordcut moved along the church and the churchyard became graduallyvisible whatever my expectation was it was not disappointed forthere on our favourite seat the silver light of the moon struck ahalfreclining figure snowy white the coming of the cloud was tooquick for me to see much for shadow shut down on light almostimmediately but it seemed to me as though something dark stood behindthe seat where the white figure shone and bent over it what it waswhether man or beast i could not tell i did not wait to catch anotherglance but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by thefishmarket to the bridge which was the only way to reach the eastcliff the town seemed as dead for not a soul did i see i rejoicedthat it was so for i wanted no witness of poor lucys condition thetime and distance seemed endless and my knees trembled and my breathcame laboured as i toiled up the endless steps to the abbey i must havegone fast and yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted withlead and as though every joint in my body were rusty when i got almostto the top i could see the seat and the white figure for i was nowclose enough to distinguish it even through the spells of shadow therewas undoubtedly something long and black bending over thehalfreclining white figure i called in fright lucy lucy andsomething raised a head and from where i was i could see a white faceand red gleaming eyes lucy did not answer and i ran on to theentrance of the churchyard as i entered the church was between me andthe seat and for a minute or so i lost sight of her when i came inview again the cloud had passed and the moonlight struck so brilliantlythat i could see lucy half reclining with her head lying over the backof the seat she was quite alone and there was not a sign of any livingthing aboutwhen i bent over her i could see that she was still asleep her lipswere parted and she was breathingnot softly as usual with her but inlong heavy gasps as though striving to get her lungs full at everybreath as i came close she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled thecollar of her nightdress close around her throat whilst she did sothere came a little shudder through her as though she felt the cold iflung the warm shawl over her and drew the edges tight round her neckfor i dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night airunclad as she was i feared to wake her all at once so in order tohave my hands free that i might help her i fastened the shawl at herthroat with a big safetypin but i must have been clumsy in my anxietyand pinched or pricked her with it for byandby when her breathingbecame quieter she put her hand to her throat again and moaned when ihad her carefully wrapped up i put my shoes on her feet and then beganvery gently to wake her at first she did not respond but gradually shebecame more and more uneasy in her sleep moaning and sighingoccasionally at last as time was passing fast and for many otherreasons i wished to get her home at once i shook her more forciblytill finally she opened her eyes and awoke she did not seem surprisedto see me as of course she did not realise all at once where she waslucy always wakes prettily and even at such a time when her body musthave been chilled with cold and her mind somewhat appalled at wakingunclad in a churchyard at night she did not lose her grace shetrembled a little and clung to me when i told her to come at once withme home she rose without a word with the obedience of a child as wepassed along the gravel hurt my feet and lucy noticed me wince shestopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes but i would nothowever when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard where therewas a puddle of water remaining from the storm i daubed my feet withmud using each foot in turn on the other so that as we went home noone in case we should meet any one should notice my bare feetfortune favoured us and we got home without meeting a soul once we sawa man who seemed not quite sober passing along a street in front ofus but we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such asthere are here steep little closes or wynds as they call them inscotland my heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes i thought ishould faint i was filled with anxiety about lucy not only for herhealth lest she should suffer from the exposure but for her reputationin case the story should get wind when we got in and had washed ourfeet and had said a prayer of thankfulness together i tucked her intobed before falling asleep she askedeven imploredme not to say aword to any one even her mother about her sleepwalking adventure ihesitated at first to promise but on thinking of the state of hermothers health and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret herand thinking too of how such a story might become distortednayinfallibly wouldin case it should leak out i thought it wiser to doso i hope i did right i have locked the door and the key is tied tomy wrist so perhaps i shall not be again disturbed lucy is sleepingsoundly the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea                                   same day noonall goes well lucy slept till i woke her and seemednot to have even changed her side the adventure of the night does notseem to have harmed her on the contrary it has benefited her for shelooks better this morning than she has done for weeks i was sorry tonotice that my clumsiness with the safetypin hurt her indeed it mighthave been serious for the skin of her throat was pierced i must havepinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it for there aretwo little red points like pinpricks and on the band of her nightdresswas a drop of blood when i apologised and was concerned about it shelaughed and petted me and said she did not even feel it fortunately itcannot leave a scar as it is so tiny                                   same day nightwe passed a happy day the air was clear and thesun bright and there was a cool breeze we took our lunch to mulgravewoods mrs westenra driving by the road and lucy and i walking by thecliffpath and joining her at the gate i felt a little sad myself fori could not but feel how absolutely happy it would have been hadjonathan been with me but there i must only be patient in the eveningwe strolled in the casino terrace and heard some good music by spohrand mackenzie and went to bed early lucy seems more restful than shehas been for some time and fell asleep at once i shall lock the doorand secure the key the same as before though i do not expect anytrouble tonight                                    augustmy expectations were wrong for twice during the night iwas wakened by lucy trying to get out she seemed even in her sleep tobe a little impatient at finding the door shut and went back to bedunder a sort of protest i woke with the dawn and heard the birdschirping outside of the window lucy woke too and i was glad to seewas even better than on the previous morning all her old gaiety ofmanner seemed to have come back and she came and snuggled in beside meand told me all about arthur i told her how anxious i was aboutjonathan and then she tried to comfort me well she succeededsomewhat for though sympathy cant alter facts it can help to makethem more bearable                                    augustanother quiet day and to bed with the key on my wrist asbefore again i awoke in the night and found lucy sitting up in bedstill asleep pointing to the window i got up quietly and pullingaside the blind looked out it was brilliant moonlight and the softeffect of the light over the sea and skymerged together in one greatsilent mysterywas beautiful beyond words between me and the moonlightflitted a great bat coming and going in great whirling circles once ortwice it came quite close but was i suppose frightened at seeing meand flitted away across the harbour towards the abbey when i came backfrom the window lucy had lain down again and was sleeping peacefullyshe did not stir again all night                                    auguston the east cliff reading and writing all day lucy seemsto have become as much in love with the spot as i am and it is hard toget her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea ordinner this afternoon she made a funny remark we were coming home fordinner and had come to the top of the steps up from the west pier andstopped to look at the view as we generally do the setting sun lowdown in the sky was just dropping behind kettleness the red light wasthrown over on the east cliff and the old abbey and seemed to batheeverything in a beautiful rosy glow we were silent for a while andsuddenly lucy murmured as if to herselfhis red eyes again they are just the same it was such an oddexpression coming apropos of nothing that it quite startled me islewed round a little so as to see lucy well without seeming to stareat her and saw that she was in a halfdreamy state with an odd look onher face that i could not quite make out so i said nothing butfollowed her eyes she appeared to be looking over at our own seatwhereon was a dark figure seated alone i was a little startled myselffor it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes likeburning flames but a second look dispelled the illusion the redsunlight was shining on the windows of st marys church behind ourseat and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in therefraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved icalled lucys attention to the peculiar effect and she became herselfwith a start but she looked sad all the same it may have been that shewas thinking of that terrible night up there we never refer to it so isaid nothing and we went home to dinner lucy had a headache and wentearly to bed i saw her asleep and went out for a little stroll myselfi walked along the cliffs to the westward and was full of sweetsadness for i was thinking of jonathan when coming homeit was thenbright moonlight so bright that though the front of our part of thecrescent was in shadow everything could be well seeni threw a glanceup at our window and saw lucys head leaning out i thought thatperhaps she was looking out for me so i opened my handkerchief andwaved it she did not notice or make any movement whatever just thenthe moonlight crept round an angle of the building and the light fellon the window there distinctly was lucy with her head lying up againstthe side of the windowsill and her eyes shut she was fast asleep andby her seated on the windowsill was something that looked like agoodsized bird i was afraid she might get a chill so i ran upstairsbut as i came into the room she was moving back to her bed fastasleep and breathing heavily she was holding her hand to her throatas though to protect it from coldi did not wake her but tucked her up warmly i have taken care that thedoor is locked and the window securely fastenedshe looks so sweet as she sleeps but she is paler than is her wont andthere is a drawn haggard look under her eyes which i do not like ifear she is fretting about something i wish i could find out what itis                                    augustrose later than usual lucy was languid and tired andslept on after we had been called we had a happy surprise at breakfastarthurs father is better and wants the marriage to come off soon lucyis full of quiet joy and her mother is glad and sorry at once later onin the day she told me the cause she is grieved to lose lucy as hervery own but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have some one toprotect her poor dear sweet lady she confided to me that she has gother deathwarrant she has not told lucy and made me promise secrecyher doctor told her that within a few months at most she must die forher heart is weakening at any time even now a sudden shock would bealmost sure to kill her ah we were wise to keep from her the affair ofthe dreadful night of lucys sleepwalking                                    augustno diary for two whole days i have not had the heart towrite some sort of shadowy pall seems to be coming over our happinessno news from jonathan and lucy seems to be growing weaker whilst hermothers hours are numbering to a close i do not understand lucysfading away as she is doing she eats well and sleeps well and enjoysthe fresh air but all the time the roses in her cheeks are fading andshe gets weaker and more languid day by day at night i hear her gaspingas if for air i keep the key of our door always fastened to my wrist atnight but she gets up and walks about the room and sits at the openwindow last night i found her leaning out when i woke up and when itried to wake her i could not she was in a faint when i managed torestore her she was as weak as water and cried silently between longpainful struggles for breath when i asked her how she came to be at thewindow she shook her head and turned away i trust her feeling ill maynot be from that unlucky prick of the safetypin i looked at her throatjust now as she lay asleep and the tiny wounds seem not to have healedthey are still open and if anything larger than before and theedges of them are faintly white they are like little white dots withred centres unless they heal within a day or two i shall insist on thedoctor seeing about them augustdear sirsherewith please receive invoice of goods sent by great northernrailway same are to be delivered at carfax near

and did not disturb me once the roses seem coming back alreadyto her cheeks though she is still sadly pale and wanlooking if shewere in any way anæmic i could understand it but she is not she is ingay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness all the morbid reticenceseems to have passed from her and she has just reminded me as if ineeded any reminding of that night and that it was here on thisvery seat i found her asleep as she told me she tapped playfully withthe heel of her boot on the stone slab and saidmy poor little feet didnt make much noise then i daresay poor old mrswales would have told me that it was because i didnt want to wake upgeordie as she was in such a communicative humour i asked her if shehad dreamed at all that night before she answered that sweet puckeredlook came into her forehead which arthuri call him arthur from herhabitsays he loves and indeed i dont wonder that he does then shewent on in a halfdreaming kind of way as if trying to recall it toherselfi didnt quite dream but it all seemed to be real i only wanted to behere in this spoti dont know why for i was afraid of somethingidont know what i remember though i suppose i was asleep passingthrough the streets and over the bridge a fish leaped as i went by andi leaned over to look at it and i heard a lot of dogs howlingthewhole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling at onceasi went up the steps then i had a vague memory of something long anddark with red eyes just as we saw in the sunset and something verysweet and very bitter all around me at once and then i seemed sinkinginto deep green water and there was a singing in my ears as i haveheard there is to drowning men and then everything seemed passing awayfrom me my soul seemed to go out from my body and float about the airi seem to remember that once the west lighthouse was right under meand then there was a sort of agonising feeling as if i were in anearthquake and i came back and found you shaking my body i saw you doit before i felt youthen she began to laugh it seemed a little uncanny to me and ilistened to her breathlessly i did not quite like it and thought itbetter not to keep her mind on the subject so we drifted on to othersubjects and lucy was like her old self again when we got home thefresh breeze had braced her up and her pale cheeks were really morerosy her mother rejoiced when she saw her and we all spent a veryhappy evening together                                    augustjoy joy joy although not all joy at last news ofjonathan the dear fellow has been ill that is why he did

sudden change in renfield last night abouteight oclock he began to get excited and sniff about as a dog does whensetting the attendant was struck by his manner and knowing my interestin him encouraged him to talk he is usually respectful to theattendant and at times servile but tonight the man tells me he wasquite haughty would not condescend to talk with him at all all hewould say was     i dont want to talk to you you dont count now the master is at     handthe attendant thinks it is some sudden form of religious mania which hasseized him if so we must look out for squalls for a strong man withhomicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous thecombination is a dreadful one at nine oclock i visited him myself hisattitude to me was the same as that to the attendant in his sublimeselffeeling the difference between myself and attendant seemed to himas nothing it looks like religious mania and he will soon think thathe himself is god these infinitesimal distinctions between man and manare too paltry for an omnipotent being how these madmen give themselvesaway the real god taketh heed lest a sparrow fall but the god createdfrom human vanity sees no difference between an eagle and a sparrow ohif men only knewfor half an hour or more renfield kept getting excited in greater andgreater degree i did not pretend to be watching him but i kept strictobservation all the same all at once that shifty look came into hiseyes which we always see when a madman has seized an idea and with itthe shifty movement of the head and back which asylum attendants come toknow so well he became quite quiet and went and sat on the edge of hisbed resignedly and looked into space with lacklustre eyes i thought iwould find out if his apathy were real or only assumed and tried tolead him to talk of his pets a theme which had never failed to excitehis attention at first he made no reply but at length said testilybother them all i dont care a pin about themwhat i said you dont mean to tell me you dont care aboutspiders spiders at present are his hobby and the notebook is fillingup with columns of small figures to this he answered enigmaticallythe bridemaidens rejoice the eyes that wait the coming of the bridebut when the bride draweth nigh then the maidens shine not to the eyesthat are filledhe would not explain himself but remained obstinately seated on his bedall the time i remained with himi am weary tonight and low in spirits i cannot but think of lucy andhow different things might have been if i dont sleep at once chloralthe modern morpheuschclo ho i must be careful not to letit grow into a habit no i shall take none tonight i have thought oflucy and i shall not dishonour her by mixing the two if need betonight shall be sleepless                                   laterglad i made the resolution gladder that i kept to it i hadlain tossing about and had heard the clock strike only twice when thenightwatchman came to me sent up from the ward to say that renfieldhad escaped i threw on my clothes and ran down at once my patient istoo dangerous a person to be roaming about those ideas of his mightwork out dangerously with strangers the attendant was waiting for mehe said he had seen him not ten minutes before seemingly asleep in hisbed when he had looked through the observationtrap in the door hisattention was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out heran back and saw his feet disappear through the window and had at oncesent up for me he was only in his nightgear and cannot be far offthe attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he shouldgo than to follow him as he might lose sight of him whilst getting outof the building by the door he is a bulky man and couldnt get throughthe window i am thin so with his aid i got out but feet foremostand as we were only a few feet above ground landed unhurt theattendant told me the patient had gone to the left and had taken astraight line so i ran as quickly as i could as i got through the beltof trees i saw a white figure scale the high wall which separates ourgrounds from those of the deserted housei ran back at once told the watchman to get three or four menimmediately and follow me into the grounds of carfax in case our friendmight be dangerous i got a ladder myself and crossing the walldropped down on the other side i could see renfields figure justdisappearing behind the angle of the house so i ran after him on thefar side of the house i found him pressed close against the oldironbound oak door of the chapel he was talking apparently to someone but i was afraid to go near enough to hear what he was saying lesti might frighten him and he should run off chasing an errant swarm ofbees is nothing to following a naked lunatic when the fit of escapingis upon him after a few minutes however i could see that he did nottake note of anything around him and so ventured to draw nearer tohimthe more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing himin i heard him sayi am here to do your bidding master i am your slave and you willreward me for i shall be faithful i have worshipped you long and afaroff now that you are near i await your commands and you will not passme by will you dear master in your distribution of good thingshe is a selfish old beggar anyhow he thinks of the loaves and fisheseven when he believes he is in a real presence his manias make astartling combination when we closed in on him he fought like a tigerhe is immensely strong for he was more like a wild beast than a man inever saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before and i hope ishall not again it is a mercy that we have found out his strength andhis danger in good time with strength and determination like his hemight have done wild work before he was caged he is safe now at anyrate jack sheppard himself couldnt get free from the straitwaistcoatthat keeps him restrained and hes chained to the wall in the paddedroom his cries are at times awful but the silences that follow aremore deadly still for he means murder in every turn and movementjust now he spoke coherent words for the first timei shall be patient master it is comingcomingcomingso i took the hint and came too i was too excited to sleep but thisdiary has quieted me and i feel i shall get some sleep tonightbudapesth  augustmy dearest lucyi know you will be anxious to hear all that has happened since weparted at the railway station at whitby well my dear i got to hullall right and caught the boat to hamburg and then the train on here ifeel that i can hardly recall anything of the journey except that iknew i was coming to jonathan and that as i should have to do somenursing i had better get all the sleep i could i found my dear oneoh so thin and pale and weaklooking all the resolution has gone outof his dear eyes and that quiet dignity which i told you was in hisface has vanished he is only a wreck of himself and he does notremember anything that has happened to him for a long time past atleast he wants me to believe so and i shall never ask he has had someterrible shock and i fear it might tax his poor brain if he were to tryto recall it sister agatha who is a good creature and a born nursetells me that he raved of dreadful things whilst he was off his head iwanted her to tell me what they were but she would only cross herselfand say she would never tell that the ravings of the sick were thesecrets of god and that if a nurse through her vocation should hearthem she should respect her trust she is a sweet good soul and thenext day when she saw i was troubled she opened up the subject againand after saying that she could never mention what my poor dear ravedabout added i can tell you this much my dear that it was not aboutanything which he has done wrong himself and you as his wife to behave no cause to be concerned he has not forgotten you or what he owesto you his fear was of great and terrible things which no mortal cantreat of i do believe the dear soul thought i might be jealous lest mypoor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl the idea ofmy being jealous about jonathan and yet my dear let me whisper ifelt a thrill of joy through me when i knew that no other woman was acause of trouble i am now sitting by his bedside where i can see hisface while he sleeps he is wakingwhen he woke he asked me for his coat as he wanted to get somethingfrom the pocket i asked sister agatha and she brought all his thingsi saw that amongst them was his notebook and was going to ask him tolet me look at itfor i knew then that i might find some clue to histroublebut i suppose he must have seen my wish in my eyes for he sentme over to the window saying he wanted to be quite alone for a momentthen he called me back and when i came he had his hand over thenotebook and he said to me very solemnlywilhelminai knew then that he was in deadly earnest for he hasnever called me by that name since he asked me to marry himyou knowdear my ideas of the trust between husband and wife there should be nosecret no concealment i have had a great shock and when i try tothink of what it is i feel my head spin

ring then i kissed it and showed itto my husband and told him that i would keep it so and then it wouldbe an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted eachother that i would never open it unless it were for his own dear sakeor for the sake of some stern duty then he took my hand in his and ohlucy it was the first time he took his wifes hand and said that itwas the dearest thing in all the wide world and that he would gothrough all the past again to win it if need be the poor dear meant tohave said a part of the past but he cannot think of time yet and ishall not wonder if at

sewards diary augustthe case of renfield grows even more interesting he hasnow so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from his passionfor the first week after his attack he was perpetually violent then onenight just as the moon rose he grew quiet and kept murmuring tohimself now i can wait now i can wait the attendant came to tellme so i ran down at once to have a look at him he was still in thestraitwaistcoat and in the padded room but the suffused look had gonefrom his face and his eyes had something of their old pleadingi mightalmost say cringingsoftness i was satisfied with his presentcondition and directed him to be relieved the attendants hesitatedbut finally carried out my wishes without protest it was a strangething that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust forcoming close to me he said in a whisper all the while lookingfurtively at themthey think i could hurt you fancy me hurting you the foolsit was soothing somehow to the feelings to find myself dissociatedeven in the mind of this poor madman from the others but all the same ido not follow his thought am i to take it that i have anything incommon with him so that we are as it were to stand together or hashe to gain from me some good so stupendous that my wellbeing is needfulto him i must find out later on tonight he will not speak even theoffer of a kitten or even a fullgrown cat will not tempt him he willonly say i dont take any stock in cats i have more to think of nowand i can wait i can waitafter a while i left him the attendant tells me that he was quietuntil just before dawn and that then he began to get uneasy and atlength violent until at last he fell into a paroxysm which exhaustedhim so that he swooned into a sort of coma                                    three nights has the same thing happenedviolent all day then quietfrom moonrise to sunrise i wish i could get some clue to the cause itwould almost seem as if there was some influence which came and wenthappy thought we shall tonight play sane wits against mad ones heescaped before without our help tonight he shall escape with it weshall give him a chance and have the men ready to follow in case theyare required                                    augustthe unexpected always happens how well disraeli knewlife our bird when he found the cage open would not fly so all oursubtle arrangements were for nought at any rate we have proved onething that the spells of quietness last a reasonable time we shall infuture be able to ease his bonds for a few hours each day i have givenorders to the night attendant merely to shut him in the padded roomwhen once he is quiet until an hour before sunrise the poor soulsbody will enjoy the relief even if his mind cannot appreciate it harkthe unexpected again i am called the patient has once more escaped                                   lateranother night adventure renfield artfully waited until theattendant was entering the room to inspect then he dashed out past himand flew down the passage i sent word for the attendants to followagain he went into the grounds of the deserted house and we found himin the same place pressed against the old chapel door when he saw mehe became furious and had not the attendants seized him in time hewould have tried to kill me as we were holding him a strange thinghappened he suddenly redoubled his efforts and then as suddenly grewcalm i looked round instinctively but could see nothing then i caughtthe patients eye and followed it but could trace nothing as it lookedinto the moonlit sky except a big bat which was flapping its silent andghostly way to the west bats usually wheel and flit about but this oneseemed to go straight on as if it knew where it was bound for or hadsome intention of its own the patient grew calmer every instant andpresently saidyou neednt tie me i shall go quietly without trouble we came backto the house i feel there is something ominous in his calm and shallnot forget this nightlucy westenras diaryhillingham  augusti must imitate mina and keep writing thingsdown then we can have long talks when we do meet i wonder when it willbe i wish she were with me again for i feel so unhappy last night iseemed to be dreaming again just as i was at whitby perhaps it is thechange of air or getting home again it is all dark and horrid to mefor i can remember nothing but i am full of vague fear and i feel soweak and worn out when arthur came to lunch he looked quite grievedwhen he saw me and i hadnt the spirit to try to be cheerful i wonderif i could sleep in mothers room tonight i shall make an excuse andtry                                    augustanother bad night mother did not seem to take to myproposal she seems not too well herself and doubtless she fears toworry me i tried to keep awake and succeeded for a while but when theclock struck twelve it waked me from a doze so i must have been fallingasleep there was a sort of scratching or flapping at the window but idid not mind it and as i remember no more i suppose i must then havefallen asleep more bad dreams i wish i could remember them thismorning i am horribly weak my face is ghastly pale and my throat painsme it must be something wrong with my lungs for i dont seem ever toget air enough i shall try to cheer up when arthur comes or else iknow he will be miserable to see me soalbemarle hotel  augustmy dear jacki want you to do me a favour lucy is ill that is she has no specialdisease but she looks awful and is getting worse every day i haveasked her if there is any cause i do not dare to ask her mother for todisturb the poor ladys mind about her daughter in her present state ofhealth would be fatal mrs westenra has confided to me that her doom isspokendisease of the heartthough poor lucy does not know it yet iam sure that there is something preying on my dear girls mind i amalmost distracted when i think of her to look at her gives me a pang itold her i should ask you to see her and though she demurred atfirsti know why old fellowshe finally consented it will be apainful task for you i know old friend but it is for her sake andi must not hesitate to ask or you to act you are to come to lunch athillingham tomorrow two oclock so as not to arouse any suspicion inmrs westenra and after lunch lucy will take an opportunity of beingalone with you i shall come in for tea and we can go away together iam filled with anxiety and want to consult with you alone as soon as ican after you have seen her do not failarthurtelegram arthur holmwood to seward septemberam summoned to see my father who is worse am writing write me fullyby tonights post to ring wire me if necessary septembermy dear old fellowwith regard to miss westenras health i hasten to let you know at oncethat in my opinion there is not any functional disturbance or any maladythat i know of at the same time i am not by any means satisfied withher appearance she is woefully different from what she was when i sawher last of course you must bear in mind that i did not have fullopportunity of examination such as i should wish our very friendshipmakes a little difficulty which not even medical science or custom canbridge over i had better tell you exactly what happened leaving you todraw in a measure your own conclusions i shall then say what i havedone and propose doingi found miss westenra in seemingly gay spirits her mother was presentand in a few seconds i made up my mind that she was trying all she knewto mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious i have nodoubt she guesses if she does not know what need of caution there iswe lunched alone and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful wegot as some kind of reward for our labours some real cheerfulnessamongst us then mrs westenra went to lie down and lucy was left withme we went into her boudoir and till we got there her gaiety remainedfor the servants were coming and going as soon as the door was closedhowever the mask fell from her face and she sank down into a chairwith a great sigh and hid her eyes with her hand when i saw that herhigh spirits had failed i at once took advantage of her reaction tomake a diagnosis she said to me very sweetlyi cannot tell you how i loathe talking about myself i reminded herthat a doctors confidence was sacred but that you were grievouslyanxious about her she caught on to my meaning at once and settled thatmatter in a word tell arthur everything you choose i do not care formyself but all for him so i am quite freei could easily see that she is somewhat bloodless but i could not seethe usual anæmic signs and by a chance i was actually able to test thequality of her blood for in opening a window which was stiff a cordgave way and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass it was aslight matter in itself but it gave me an evident chance and i secureda few drops of the blood and have analysed them the qualitativeanalysis gives a quite normal condition and shows i should infer initself a vigorous state of health in other physical matters i was quitesatisfied that there is no need for anxiety but as there must be acause somewhere i have come to the conclusion that it must be somethingmental she complains of difficulty in breathing satisfactorily attimes and of heavy lethargic sleep with dreams that frighten her butregarding which she can remember nothing she says that as a child sheused to walk in her sleep and that when in whitby the habit came backand that once she walked out in the night and went to east cliff wheremiss murray found her but she assures me that of late the habit has notreturned i am in doubt and so have done the best thing i know of ihave written to my old friend and master professor van helsing ofamsterdam who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in theworld i have asked him to come over and as you told me that all thingswere to be at your charge i have mentioned to him who you are and yourrelations to miss westenra this my dear fellow is in obedience toyour wishes for i am only too proud and happy to do anything i can forher van helsing would i know do anything for me for a personalreason so no matter on what ground he comes we must accept hiswishes he is a seemingly arbitrary man but this is because he knowswhat he is talking about better than any one else he is a philosopherand a metaphysician and one of the most advanced scientists of his dayand he has i believe an absolutely open mind this with an ironnerve a temper of the icebrook an indomitable resolutionselfcommand and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings and thekindliest and truest heart that beatsthese form his equipment for thenoble work that he is doing for mankindwork both in theory andpractice for his views are as wide as his allembracing sympathy itell you these facts that you may know why i have such confidence inhim i have asked him to come at once i shall see miss westenratomorrow again she is to meet me at the stores so that i may notalarm her mother by too early a repetition of my callyours alwaysjohn seward septembermy good friendwhen i have received your letter i am already coming to you by goodfortune i can leave just at once without wrong to any of those who havetrusted me were fortune other then it were bad for those who havetrusted for i come to my friend when he call me to aid those he holdsdear tell your friend that when that time you suck from my wound soswiftly the poison of the gangrene from that knife that our otherfriend too nervous let slip you did more for him when he wants myaids and you call for them than all his great fortune could do but itis pleasure added to do for him your friend it is to you that i comehave then rooms for me at the great eastern hotel so that i may be nearto hand and please it so arrange that we may see the young lady not toolate on tomorrow for it is likely that i may have to return here thatnight but if need be i shall come again in three days and stay longerif it must till then goodbye my friend john van helsing septembermy dear artvan helsing has come and gone he came on with me to hillingham andfound that by lucys discretion her mother was lunching out so thatwe were alone with her van helsing made a very careful examination ofthe patient he is to report to me and i shall advise you for ofcourse i was not present all the time he is i fear much concernedbut says he must think when i told him of our friendship and how youtrust to me in the matter he said you must tell him all you thinktell him what i think if you can guess it if you will nay i am notjesting this is no jest but life and death perhaps more i askedwhat he meant by that for he was very serious this was when we hadcome back to town and he was having a cup of tea before starting on hisreturn to amsterdam he would not give me any further clue you must notbe angry with me art because his very reticence means that all hisbrains are working for her good he will speak plainly enough when thetime comes be sure so i told him i would simply write an account ofour visit just as if i were doing a descriptive special article forthe daily telegraph he seemed not to notice but remarked that thesmuts in london were not quite so bad as they used to be when he was astudent here i am to get his report tomorrow if he can possibly makeit in any case i am to have a letterwell as to the visit lucy was more cheerful than on the day i firstsaw her and certainly looked better she had lost something of theghastly look that so upset you and her breathing was normal she wasvery sweet to the professor as she always is and tried to make himfeel at ease though i could see that the poor girl was making a hardstruggle for it i believe van helsing saw it too for i saw the quicklook under his bushy brows that i knew of old then he began to
