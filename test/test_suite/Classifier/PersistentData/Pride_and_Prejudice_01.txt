it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possessionof a good fortune must be in want of a wifehowever little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on hisfirst entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the mindsof the surrounding families that he is considered the rightful propertyof some one or other of their daughtersmy dear mr bennet said his lady to him one day have you heard thatnetherfield park is let at lastmr bennet replied that he had notbut it is returned she for mrs long has just been here and shetold me all about itmr bennet made no answerdo you not want to know who has taken it cried his wife impatientlyyou want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing itthis was invitation enoughwhy my dear you must know mrs long says that netherfield is takenby a young man of large fortune from the north of england that he camedown on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so muchdelighted with it that he agreed with mr morris immediately that heis to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are tobe in the house by the end of next weekwhat is his namebingleyis he married or singleoh single my dear to be sure a single man of large fortune four orfive thousand a year what a fine thing for our girlshow so how can it affect themmy dear mr bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome youmust know that i am thinking of his marrying one of themis that his design in settling heredesign nonsense how can you talk so but it is very likely that hemay fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him assoon as he comesi see no occasion for that you and the girls may go or you may sendthem by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you areas handsome as any of them mr bingley may like you the best of thepartymy dear you flatter me i certainly have had my share of beauty buti do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now when a woman has fivegrownup daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beautyin such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think ofbut my dear you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he comes intothe neighbourhoodit is more than i engage for i assure youbut consider your daughters only think what an establishment it wouldbe for one of them sir william and lady lucas are determined togo merely on that account for in general you know they visit nonewcomers indeed you must go for it will be impossible for us tovisit him if you do notyou are overscrupulous surely i dare say mr bingley will be veryglad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of myhearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls thoughi must throw in a good word for my little lizzyi desire you will do no such thing lizzy is not a bit better than theothers and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half sogoodhumoured as lydia but you are always giving her the preferencethey have none of them much to recommend them replied he they areall silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more ofquickness than her sistersmr bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way youtake delight in vexing me you have no compassion for my poor nervesyou mistake me my dear i have a high respect for your nerves theyare my old friends i have heard you mention them with considerationthese last twenty years at leastah you do not know what i sufferbut i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of fourthousand a year come into the neighbourhoodit will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will notvisit themdepend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit themallmr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humourreserve and caprice that the experience of threeandtwenty years hadbeen insufficient to make his wife understand his character her mindwas less difficult to develop she was a woman of mean understandinglittle information and uncertain temper when she was discontentedshe fancied herself nervous the business of her life was to get herdaughters married its solace was visiting and newsmr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley hehad always intended to visit him though to the last always assuringhis wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit waspaid she had no knowledge of it it was then disclosed in the followingmanner observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat hesuddenly addressed her withi hope mr bingley will like it lizzywe are not in a way to know what mr bingley likes said her motherresentfully since we are not to visitbut you forget mamma said elizabeth that we shall meet him at theassemblies and that mrs long promised to introduce himi do not believe mrs long will do any such thing she has two niecesof her own she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinionof herno more have i said mr bennet and i am glad to find that you donot depend on her serving youmrs bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to containherself began scolding one of her daughtersdont keep coughing so kitty for heavens sake have a littlecompassion on my nerves you tear them to pieceskitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father she timesthem illi do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully when isyour next ball to be lizzytomorrow fortnightaye so it is cried her mother and mrs long does not come backtill the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce himfor she will not know him herselfthen my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introducemr bingley to herimpossible mr bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with himmyself how can you be so teasingi honour your circumspection a fortnights acquaintance is certainlyvery little one cannot know what a man really is by the end of afortnight but if we do not venture somebody else will and after allmrs long and her neices must stand their chance and therefore asshe will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i willtake it on myselfthe girls stared at their father mrs bennet said only nonsensenonsensewhat can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation cried he doyou consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid onthem as nonsense i cannot quite agree with you there what say youmary for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and readgreat books and make extractsmary wished to say something sensible but knew not howwhile mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to mrbingleyi am sick of mr bingley cried his wifei am sorry to hear that but why did not you tell me that before ifi had known as much this morning i certainly would not have calledon him it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit wecannot escape the acquaintance nowthe astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of mrsbennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joywas over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all thewhilehow good it was in you my dear mr bennet but i knew i shouldpersuade you at last i was sure you loved your girls too well toneglect such an acquaintance well how pleased i am and it is such agood joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said aword about it till nownow kitty you may cough as much as you choose said mr bennet andas he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wifewhat an excellent father you have girls said she when the door wasshut i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindnessor me either for that matter at our time of life it is not sopleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintances every day butfor your sakes we would do anything lydia my love though you arethe youngest i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the nextballoh said lydia stoutly i am not afraid for though i am theyoungest im the tallestthe rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he wouldreturn mr bennets visit and determining when they should ask him todinnernot all that mrs bennet however with the assistance of her fivedaughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from herhusband any satisfactory description of mr bingley they attacked himin various wayswith barefaced questions ingenious suppositions anddistant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were atlast obliged to accept the secondhand intelligence of their neighbourlady lucas her report was highly favourable sir william had beendelighted with him he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremelyagreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assemblywith a large party nothing could be more delightful to be fond ofdancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very livelyhopes of mr bingleys heart were entertainedif i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield said mrs bennet to her husband and all the others equally wellmarried i shall have nothing to wish forin a few days mr bingley returned mr bennets visit and sat aboutten minutes with him in his library he had entertained hopes of beingadmitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he hadheard much but he saw only the father the ladies were somewhat morefortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upperwindow that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horsean invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched and alreadyhad mrs bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to herhousekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it all mr bingleywas obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unableto accept the honour of their invitation etc mrs bennet was quitedisconcerted she could not imagine what business he could have in townso soon after his arrival in hertfordshire and she began to fear thathe might be always flying about from one place to another and neversettled at netherfield as he ought to be lady lucas quieted her fearsa little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to geta large party for the ball and a report soon followed that mr bingleywas to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assemblythe girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted theday before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he brought onlysix with him from londonhis five sisters and a cousin and whenthe party entered the assembly room it consisted of only fivealtogethermr bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest andanother young manmr bingley was goodlooking and gentlemanlike he had a pleasantcountenance and easy unaffected manners his sisters were fine womenwith an air of decided fashion his brotherinlaw mr hurst merelylooked the gentleman but his friend mr darcy soon drew the attentionof the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien andthe report which was in general circulation within five minutesafter his entrance of his having ten thousand a year the gentlemenpronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared hewas much handsomer than mr bingley and he was looked at with greatadmiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgustwhich turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to beproud to be above his company and above being pleased and not allhis large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a mostforbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be comparedwith his friendmr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principalpeople in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dancewas angry that the ball closed so early and talked of givingone himself at netherfield such amiable qualities must speak forthemselves what a contrast between him and his friend mr darcy dancedonly once with mrs hurst and once with miss bingley declined beingintroduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening inwalking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own partyhis character was decided he was the proudest most disagreeable manin the world and everybody hoped that he would never come there againamongst the most violent against him was mrs bennet whose dislike ofhis general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by hishaving slighted one of her daughterselizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sitdown for two dances and during part of that time mr darcy had beenstanding near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and mrbingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friendto join itcome darcy said he i must have you dance i hate to see youstanding about by yourself in this stupid manner you had much betterdancei certainly shall not you know how i detest it unless i amparticularly acquainted with my partner at such an assembly as thisit would be insupportable your sisters are engaged and there is notanother woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me tostand up withi would not be so fastidious as you are cried mr bingley for akingdom upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls inmy life as i have this evening and there are several of them you seeuncommonly prettyyou are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said mrdarcy looking at the eldest miss bennetoh she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld but there is oneof her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and idare say very agreeable do let me ask my partner to introduce youwhich do you mean and turning round he looked for a moment atelizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly saidshe is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me i am in nohumour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slightedby other men you had better return to your partner and enjoy hersmiles for you are wasting your time with memr bingley followed his advice mr darcy walked off and elizabethremained with no very cordial feelings toward him she told the storyhowever with great spirit among her friends for she had a livelyplayful disposition which delighted in anything ridiculousthe evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family mrsbennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfieldparty mr bingley had danced with her twice and she had beendistinguished by his sisters jane was as much gratified by this asher mother could be though in a quieter way elizabeth felt janespleasure mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the mostaccomplished girl in the neighbourhood and catherine and lydia had beenfortunate enough never to be without partners which was all that theyhad yet learnt to care for at a ball they returned therefore in goodspirits to longbourn the village where they lived and of which theywere the principal inhabitants they found mr bennet still up witha book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had agood deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raisedsuch splendid expectations he had rather hoped that his wifes views onthe stranger would be disappointed but he soon found out that he had adifferent story to hearoh my dear mr bennet as she entered the room we have had a mostdelightful evening a most excellent ball i wish you had been therejane was so admired nothing could be like it everybody said how wellshe looked and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced withher twice only think of that my dear he actually danced with hertwice and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a secondtime first of all he asked miss lucas i was so vexed to see him standup with her but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobodycan you know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was goingdown the dance so he inquired who she was and got introduced andasked her for the two next then the two third he danced with miss kingand the two fourth with maria lucas and the two fifth with jane againand the two sixth with lizzy and the boulangerif he had had any compassion for me cried her husband impatientlyhe would not have danced half so much for gods sake say no more ofhis partners oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first danceoh my dear i am quite delighted with him he is so excessivelyhandsome and his sisters are charming women i never in my life sawanything more elegant than their dresses i dare say the lace upon mrshursts gownhere she was interrupted again mr bennet protested against anydescription of finery she was therefore obliged to seek another branchof the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and someexaggeration the shocking rudeness of mr darcybut i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much by notsuiting his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not atall worth pleasing so high and so conceited that there was no enduringhim he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so verygreat not handsome enough to dance with i wish you had been there mydear to have given him one of your setdowns i quite detest the manwhen jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious inher praise of mr bingley before expressed to her sister just how verymuch she admired himhe is just what a young man ought to be said she sensiblegoodhumoured lively and i never saw such happy mannersso muchease with such perfect good breedinghe is also handsome replied elizabeth which a young man oughtlikewise to be if he possibly can his character is thereby completei was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time idid not expect such a complimentdid not you i did for you but that is one great difference betweenus compliments always take you by surprise and me never whatcould be more natural than his asking you again he could not helpseeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other womanin the room no thanks to his gallantry for that well he certainly isvery agreeable and i give you leave to like him you have liked many astupider persondear lizzyoh you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in generalyou never see a fault in anybody all the world are good and agreeablein your eyes i never heard you speak ill of a human being in yourlifei would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone but i always speakwhat i thinki know you do and it is that which makes the wonder with yourgood sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense ofothers affectation of candour is common enoughone meets with iteverywhere but to be candid without ostentation or designto take thegood of everybodys character and make it still better and say nothingof the badbelongs to you alone and so you like this mans sisterstoo do you their manners are not equal to hiscertainly notat first but they are very pleasing women when youconverse with them miss bingley is to live with her brother and keephis house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charmingneighbour in herelizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour atthe assembly had not been calculated to please in general and with morequickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sisterand with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself shewas very little disposed to approve them they were in fact very fineladies not deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in thepower of making themselves agreeable when they chose it but proud andconceited they were rather handsome had been educated in one of thefirst private seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousandpounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and ofassociating with people of rank and were therefore in every respectentitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others they were ofa respectable family in the north of england a circumstance more deeplyimpressed on their memories than that their brothers fortune and theirown had been acquired by trademr bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundredthousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase anestate but did not live to do it mr bingley intended it likewise andsometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with agood house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of thosewho best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend theremainder of his days at netherfield and leave the next generation topurchasehis sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own butthough he was now only established as a tenant miss bingley was by nomeans unwilling to preside at his tablenor was mrs hurst who hadmarried a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to considerhis house as her home when it suited her mr bingley had not been ofage two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendationto look at netherfield house he did look at it and into it forhalfanhourwas pleased with the situation and the principalrooms satisfied with what the owner said in its praise and took itimmediatelybetween him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite ofgreat opposition of character bingley was endeared to darcy by theeasiness openness and ductility of his temper though no dispositioncould offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own henever appeared dissatisfied on the strength of darcys regard bingleyhad the firmest reliance and of his judgement the highest opinionin understanding darcy was the superior bingley was by no meansdeficient but darcy was clever he was at the same time haughtyreserved and fastidious and his manners though wellbred were notinviting in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage bingleywas sure of being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continuallygiving offensethe manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficientlycharacteristic bingley had never met with more pleasant people orprettier girls in his life everybody had been most kind and attentiveto him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon feltacquainted with all the room and as to miss bennet he could notconceive an angel more beautiful darcy on the contrary had seen acollection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion fornone of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none receivedeither attention or pleasure miss bennet he acknowledged to be prettybut she smiled too muchmrs hurst and her sister allowed it to be sobut still they admiredher and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and onewhom they would not object to know more of miss bennet was thereforeestablished as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorized by suchcommendation to think of her as he chosewithin a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennetswere particularly intimate sir william lucas had been formerly in tradein meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to thehonour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoraltythe distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly it had given him adisgust to his business and to his residence in a small market townand in quitting them both he had removed with his family to a houseabout a mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodgewhere he could think with pleasure of his own importance andunshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to allthe world for though elated by his rank it did not render himsupercilious on the contrary he was all attention to everybody bynature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at stjamess had made him courteouslady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be avaluable neighbour to mrs bennet they had several children the eldestof them a sensible intelligent young woman about twentyseven waselizabeths intimate friendthat the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk overa ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assemblybrought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicateyou began the evening well charlotte said mrs bennet with civilselfcommand to miss lucas you were mr bingleys first choiceyes but he seemed to like his second betteroh you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice to besure that did seem as if he admired herindeed i rather believe hedidi heard something about itbut i hardly know whatsomethingabout mr robinsonperhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson did noti mention it to you mr robinsons asking him how he liked our merytonassemblies and whether he did not think there were a great manypretty women in the room and which he thought the prettiest and hisanswering immediately to the last question oh the eldest miss bennetbeyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that pointupon my word well that is very decided indeedthat does seem asifbut however it may all come to nothing you knowmy overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza saidcharlotte mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friendis hepoor elizato be only just tolerablei beg you would not put it into lizzys head to be vexed by hisilltreatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quitea misfortune to be liked by him mrs long told me last night that hesat close to her for halfanhour without once opening his lipsare you quite sure maamis not there a little mistake said janei certainly saw mr darcy speaking to herayebecause she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and hecould not help answering her but she said he seemed quite angry atbeing spoke tomiss bingley told me said jane that he never speaks muchunless among his intimate acquaintances with them he is remarkablyagreeablei do not believe a word of it my dear if he had been so veryagreeable he would have talked to mrs long but i can guess how itwas everybody says that he is eat up with pride and i dare say he hadheard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage and had come tothe ball in a hack chaisei do not mind his not talking to mrs long said miss lucas but iwish he had danced with elizaanother time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with himif i were youi believe maam i may safely promise you never to dance with himhis pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as prideoften does because there is an excuse for it one cannot wonder that sovery fine a young man with family fortune everything in his favourshould think highly of himself if i may so express it he has a rightto be proudthat is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgivehis pride if he had not mortified minepride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of herreflections is a very common failing i believe by all that i haveever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that humannature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of uswho do not cherish a feeling of selfcomplacency on the score of somequality or other real or imaginary vanity and pride are differentthings though the words are often used synonymously a person maybe proud without being vain pride relates more to our opinion ofourselves vanity to what we would have others think of usif i were as rich as mr darcy cried a young lucas who came withhis sisters i should not care how proud i was i would keep a pack offoxhounds and drink a bottle of wine a daythen you would drink a great deal more than you ought said mrsbennet and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottledirectlythe boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that shewould and the argument ended only with the visitthe ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield the visitwas soon returned in due form miss bennets pleasing manners grew onthe goodwill of mrs hurst and miss bingley and though the mother wasfound to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking toa wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towardsthe two eldest by jane this attention was received with the greatestpleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatmentof everybody hardly excepting even her sister and could not like themthough their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising inall probability from the influence of their brothers admiration itwas generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her andto her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preferencewhich she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in away to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that itwas not likely to be discovered by the world in general since janeunited with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and auniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicionsof the impertinent she mentioned this to her friend miss lucasit may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to imposeon the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to beso very guarded if a woman conceals her affection with the same skillfrom the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him andit will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally inthe dark there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost everyattachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself we can allbegin freelya slight preference is natural enough but there arevery few of us who have heart enough to be really in love withoutencouragement in nine cases out of ten a women had better show moreaffection than she feels bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but hemay never do more than like her if she does not help him onbut she does help him on as much as her nature will allow if i canperceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not todiscover it tooremember eliza that he does not know janes disposition as you dobut if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to concealit he must find it outperhaps he must if he sees enough of her but though bingley and janemeet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as theyalways see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible thatevery moment should be employed in conversing together jane shouldtherefore make the most of every halfhour in which she can command hisattention when she is secure of him there will be more leisure forfalling in love as much as she choosesyour plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is inquestion but the desire of being well married and if i were determinedto get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it butthese are not janes feelings she is not acting by design as yetshe cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of itsreasonableness she has known him only a fortnight she danced fourdances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own houseand has since dined with him in company four times this is not quiteenough to make her understand his characternot as you represent it had she merely dined with him she mightonly have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you mustremember that four evenings have also been spent togetherand fourevenings may do a great dealyes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that theyboth like vingtun better than commerce but with respect to any otherleading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfoldedwell said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart andif she were married to him tomorrow i should think she had as good achance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for atwelvemonth happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance ifthe dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other orever so similar beforehand it does not advance their felicity in theleast they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards tohave their share of vexation and it is better to know as little aspossible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass yourlifeyou make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound you know it is notsound and that you would never act in this way yourselfoccupied in observing mr bingleys attentions to her sister elizabethwas far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of someinterest in the eyes of his friend mr darcy had at first scarcelyallowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at theball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise but nosooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardlyhad a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendereduncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes tothis discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying though he haddetected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetryin her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light andpleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not thoseof the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness ofthis she was perfectly unaware to her he was only the man who madehimself agreeable nowhere and who had not thought her handsome enoughto dance withhe began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversingwith her himself attended to her conversation with others his doing sodrew her notice it was at sir william lucass where a large party wereassembledwhat does mr darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to myconversation with colonel forsterthat is a question which mr darcy only can answerbut if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i seewhat he is about he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin bybeing impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of himon his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to haveany intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention sucha subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it sheturned to him and saiddid you not think mr darcy that i expressed myself uncommonlywell just now when i was teasing colonel forster to give us a ball atmerytonwith great energy but it is always a subject which makes a ladyenergeticyou are severe on usit will be her turn soon to be teased said miss lucas i am goingto open the instrument eliza and you know what followsyou are a very strange creature by way of a friendalways wanting meto play and sing before anybody and everybody if my vanity had takena musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i wouldreally rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit ofhearing the very best performers on miss lucass persevering howevershe added very well if it must be so it must and gravely glancingat mr darcy there is a fine old saying which everybody here is ofcourse familiar with keep your breath to cool your porridge and ishall keep mine to swell my songher performance was pleasing though by no means capital after a songor two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several thatshe would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by hersister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one inthe family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was alwaysimpatient for displaymary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given herapplication it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceitedmanner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than shehad reached elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to withmuch more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at theend of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude byscotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters whowith some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly indancing at one end of the roommr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode ofpassing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was toomuch engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas washis neighbour till sir william thus beganwhat a charming amusement for young people this is mr darcy thereis nothing like dancing after all i consider it as one of the firstrefinements of polished societycertainly sir and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongstthe less polished societies of the world every savage can dancesir william only smiled your friend performs delightfully hecontinued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group and i doubtnot that you are an adept in the science yourself mr darcyyou saw me dance at meryton i believe siryes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight doyou often dance at st jamessnever sirdo you not think it would be a proper compliment to the placeit is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid ityou have a house in town i concludemr darcy bowedi had once had some thought of fixing in town myselffor i am fondof superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air oflondon would agree with lady lucashe paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposedto make any and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he wasstruck with the action of doing a very gallant thing and called out tohermy dear miss eliza why are you not dancing mr darcy you must allowme to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner youcannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you and taking her hand he would have given it to mr darcy who thoughextremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantlydrew back and said with some discomposure to sir williamindeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing i entreat younot to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partnermr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour ofher hand but in vain elizabeth was determined nor did sir william atall shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasionyou excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to denyme the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes theamusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige usfor one halfhourmr darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smilinghe is indeed but considering the inducement my dear miss elizawe cannot wonder at his complaisancefor who would object to such apartnerelizabeth looked archly and turned away her resistance had notinjured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with somecomplacency when thus accosted by miss bingleyi can guess the subject of your reveriei should imagine notyou are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many eveningsin this mannerin such society and indeed i am quite of your opinioni was never more annoyed the insipidity and yet the noisethenothingness and yet the selfimportance of all those people what wouldi give to hear your strictures on themyour conjecture is totally wrong i assure you my mind was moreagreeably engaged i have been meditating on the very great pleasurewhich a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestowmiss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired hewould tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflectionsmr darcy replied with great intrepiditymiss elizabeth bennetmiss elizabeth bennet repeated miss bingley i am all astonishmenthow long has she been such a favouriteand pray when am i to wish youjoythat is exactly the question which i expected you to ask a ladysimagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from loveto matrimony in a moment i knew you would be wishing me joynay if you are serious about it i shall consider the matter isabsolutely settled you will be having a charming motherinlaw indeedand of course she will always be at pemberley with youhe listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose toentertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced herthat all was safe her wit flowed longmr bennets property consisted almost entirely in an estate of twothousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailedin default of heirs male on a distant relation and their mothersfortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supplythe deficiency of his her father had been an attorney in meryton andhad left her four thousand poundsshe had a sister married to a mr phillips who had been a clerk totheir father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled inlondon in a respectable line of tradethe village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a mostconvenient distance for the young ladies who were usually temptedthither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt andto a milliners shop just over the way the two youngest of the familycatherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentionstheir minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothingbetter offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morninghours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of newsthe country in general might be they always contrived to learn somefrom their aunt at present indeed they were well supplied both withnews and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in theneighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was theheadquarterstheir visits to mrs phillips were now productive of the mostinteresting intelligence every day added something to their knowledgeof the officers names and connections their lodgings were not long asecret and at length they began to know the officers themselves mrphillips visited them all and this opened to his nieces a store offelicity unknown before they could talk of nothing but officers andmr bingleys large fortune the mention of which gave animationto their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to theregimentals of an ensignafter listening one morning to their effusions on this subject mrbennet coolly observedfrom all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be twoof the silliest girls in the country i have suspected it some time buti am now convincedcatherine was disconcerted and made no answer but lydia with perfectindifference continued to express her admiration of captain carterand her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going thenext morning to londoni am astonished my dear said mrs bennet that you should be soready to think your own children silly if i wished to think slightinglyof anybodys children it should not be of my own howeverif my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of ityesbut as it happens they are all of them very cleverthis is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree ihad hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i mustso far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonlyfoolishmy dear mr bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense oftheir father and mother when they get to our age i dare say they willnot think about officers any more than we do i remember the time wheni liked a red coat myself very welland indeed so i do still at myheart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a yearshould want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thoughtcolonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir williams inhis regimentalsmamma cried lydia my aunt says that colonel forster and captaincarter do not go so often to miss watsons as they did when they firstcame she sees them now very often standing in clarkes librarymrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman witha note for miss bennet it came from netherfield and the servant waitedfor an answer mrs bennets eyes sparkled with pleasure and she waseagerly calling out while her daughter readwell jane who is it from what is it about what does he say welljane make haste and tell us make haste my loveit is from miss bingley said jane and then read it aloudmy dear friendif you are not so compassionate as to dine today with louisa and mewe shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our livesfor a whole days teteatete between two women can never end without aquarrel come as soon as you can on receipt of this my brother and thegentlemen are to dine with the officersyours evercaroline bingleywith the officers cried lydia i wonder my aunt did not tell us ofthatdining out said mrs bennet that is very unluckycan i have the carriage said janeno my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely torain and then you must stay all nightthat would be a good scheme said elizabeth if you were sure thatthey would not offer to send her homeoh but the gentlemen will have mr bingleys chaise to go to merytonand the hursts have no horses to theirsi had much rather go in the coachbut my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure they arewanted in the farm mr bennet are they notthey are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get thembut if you have got them today said elizabeth my mothers purposewill be answeredshe did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horseswere engaged jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and hermother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of abad day her hopes were answered jane had not been gone long beforeit rained hard her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother wasdelighted the rain continued the whole evening without intermissionjane certainly could not come backthis was a lucky idea of mine indeed said mrs bennet more thanonce as if the credit of making it rain were all her own till thenext morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of hercontrivance breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfieldbrought the following note for elizabethmy dearest lizzyi find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to beimputed to my getting wet through yesterday my kind friends will nothear of my returning till i am better they insist also on my seeing mrjonestherefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having beento meand excepting a sore throat and headache there is not much thematter with meyours etcwell my dear said mr bennet when elizabeth had read the notealoud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illnessif sheshould die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit ofmr bingley and under your ordersoh i am not afraid of her dying people do not die of little triflingcolds she will be taken good care of as long as she stays there it isall very well i would go and see her if i could have the carriageelizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her thoughthe carriage was not to be had and as she was no horsewoman walkingwas her only alternative she declared her resolutionhow can you be so silly cried her mother as to think of such athing in all this dirt you will not be fit to be seen when you gettherei shall be very fit to see janewhich is all i wantis this a hint to me lizzy said her father to send for thehorsesno indeed i do not wish to avoid the walk the distance is nothingwhen one has a motive only three miles i shall be back by dinneri admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but everyimpulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinionexertion should always be in proportion to what is requiredwe will go as far as meryton with you said catherine and lydiaelizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set offtogetherif we make haste said lydia as they walked along perhaps we maysee something of captain carter before he goesin meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of oneof the officers wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossingfield after field at a quick pace jumping over stiles and springingover puddles with impatient activity and finding herself at lastwithin view of the house with weary ankles dirty stockings and a faceglowing with the warmth of exerciseshe was shown into the breakfastparlour where all but jane wereassembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprisethat she should have walked three miles so early in the day in suchdirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to mrs hurst andmiss bingley and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contemptfor it she was received however very politely by them and in theirbrothers manners there was something better than politeness therewas good humour and kindness mr darcy said very little and mrhurst nothing at all the former was divided between admiration of thebrilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt asto the occasions justifying her coming so far alone the latter wasthinking only of his breakfasther inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered missbennet had slept ill and though up was very feverish and notwell enough to leave her room elizabeth was glad to be taken to herimmediately and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of givingalarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longedfor such a visit was delighted at her entrance she was not equalhowever to much conversation and when miss bingley left themtogether could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for theextraordinary kindness she was treated with elizabeth silently attendedherwhen breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and elizabethbegan to like them herself when she saw how much affection andsolicitude they showed for jane the apothecary came and havingexamined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caughta violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of itadvised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts the advicewas followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her headached acutely elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor werethe other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had infact nothing to do elsewherewhen the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and veryunwillingly said so miss bingley offered her the carriage and she onlywanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concernin parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offerof the chaise to an invitation to remain at netherfield for the presentelizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was dispatched tolongbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supplyof clothesat five oclock the two ladies retired to dress and at halfpast sixelizabeth was summoned to dinner to the civil inquiries which thenpoured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing themuch superior solicitude of mr bingleys she could not make a veryfavourable answer jane was by no means better the sisters on hearingthis repeated three or four times how much they were grieved howshocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they dislikedbeing ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter and theirindifference towards jane when not immediately before them restoredelizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former disliketheir brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she couldregard with any complacency his anxiety for jane was evident and hisattentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feelingherself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by theothers she had very little notice from any but him miss bingley wasengrossed by mr darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for mrhurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only toeat drink and play at cards who when he found her to prefer a plaindish to a ragout had nothing to say to herwhen dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingleybegan abusing her as soon as she was out of the room her manners werepronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinenceshe had no conversation no style no beauty mrs hurst thought thesame and addedshe has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellentwalker i shall never forget her appearance this morning she reallylooked almost wildshe did indeed louisa i could hardly keep my countenance verynonsensical to come at all why must she be scampering about thecountry because her sister had a cold her hair so untidy so blowsyyes and her petticoat i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deepin mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down tohide it not doing its officeyour picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this wasall lost upon me i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkablywell when she came into the room this morning her dirty petticoat quiteescaped my noticeyou observed it mr darcy i am sure said miss bingley and i aminclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make suchan exhibitioncertainly notto walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it isabove her ankles in dirt and alone quite alone what could she mean byit it seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independencea most countrytown indifference to decorumit shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing saidbingleyi am afraid mr darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper thatthis adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyesnot at all he replied they were brightened by the exercise ashort pause followed this speech and mrs hurst began againi have an excessive regard for miss jane bennet she is really a verysweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled but withsuch a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there isno chance of iti think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney inmerytonyes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapsidethat is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartilyif they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried bingley itwould not make them one jot less agreeablebut it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of anyconsideration in the world replied darcyto this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it theirhearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense oftheir dear friends vulgar relationswith a renewal of tenderness however they returned to her room onleaving the diningparlour and sat with her till summoned to coffeeshe was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all tilllate in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep andwhen it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should godownstairs herself on entering the drawingroom she found the wholeparty at loo and was immediately invited to join them but suspectingthem to be playing high she declined it and making her sister theexcuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could staybelow with a book mr hurst looked at her with astonishmentdo you prefer reading to cards said he that is rather singularmiss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises cards she is a greatreader and has no pleasure in anything elsei deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth i amnot a great reader and i have pleasure in many thingsin nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley andi hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite wellelizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards thetable where a few books were lying he immediately offered to fetch herothersall that his library affordedand i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my owncredit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have morethan i ever looked intoelizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with thosein the roomi am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have leftso small a collection of books what a delightful library you have atpemberley mr darcyit ought to be good he replied it has been the work of manygenerationsand then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buyingbooksi cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days astheseneglect i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties ofthat noble place charles when you build your house i wish it may behalf as delightful as pemberleyi wish it maybut i would really advise you to make your purchase in thatneighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model there is not afiner county in england than derbyshirewith all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell iti am talking of possibilities charlesupon my word caroline i should think it more possible to getpemberley by purchase than by imitationelizabeth was so much caught with what passed as to leave her verylittle attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drewnear the cardtable and stationed herself between mr bingley and hiseldest sister to observe the gameis miss darcy much grown since the spring said miss bingley willshe be as tall as i ami think she will she is now about miss elizabeth bennets height orrather tallerhow i long to see her again i never met with anybody who delighted meso much such a countenance such manners and so extremely accomplishedfor her age her performance on the pianoforte is exquisiteit is amazing to me said bingley how young ladies can have patienceto be so very accomplished as they all areall young ladies accomplished my dear charles what do you meanyes all of them i think they all paint tables cover screens andnet purses i scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this and i am surei never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without beinginformed that she was very accomplishedyour list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy hastoo much truth the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it nootherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen but i am veryfar from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general icannot boast of knowing more than halfadozen in the whole range of myacquaintance that are really accomplishednor i i am sure said miss bingleythen observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in youridea of an accomplished womanyes i do comprehend a great deal in itoh certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be reallyesteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually metwith a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawingdancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besidesall this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner ofwalking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the wordwill be but halfdeservedall this she must possess added darcy and to all this she mustyet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind byextensive readingi am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished womeni rather wonder now at your knowing anyare you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of allthisi never saw such a woman i never saw such capacity and taste andapplication and elegance as you describe unitedmrs hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of herimplied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women whoanswered this description when mr hurst called them to order withbitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward as allconversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left theroomelizabeth bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on heris one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to theother sex by undervaluing their own and with many men i dare say itsucceeds but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean artundoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressedthere is a meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescendto employ for captivation whatever bears affinity to cunning isdespicablemiss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as tocontinue the subjectelizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse andthat she could not leave her bingley urged mr jones being sent forimmediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice couldbe of any service recommended an express to town for one of the mosteminent physicians this she would not hear of but she was not sounwilling to comply with their brothers proposal and it was settledthat mr jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennetwere not decidedly better bingley was quite uncomfortable his sistersdeclared that they were miserable they solaced their wretchednesshowever by duets after supper while he could find no better reliefto his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that everyattention might be paid to the sick lady and her sisterelizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sisters room and in themorning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to theinquiries which she very early received from mr bingley by a housemaidand some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on hissisters in spite of this amendment however she requested to have anote sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form herown judgement of her situation the note was immediately dispatched andits contents as quickly complied with mrs bennet accompanied by hertwo youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfasthad she found jane in any apparent danger mrs bennet would have beenvery miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness wasnot alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as herrestoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield shewould not listen therefore to her daughters proposal of being carriedhome neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time thinkit at all advisable after sitting a little while with jane on missbingleys appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters allattended her into the breakfast parlour bingley met them with hopesthat mrs bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expectedindeed i have sir was her answer she is a great deal too ill to bemoved mr jones says we must not think of moving her we must trespassa little longer on your kindnessremoved cried bingley it must not be thought of my sister i amsure will not hear of her removalyou may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civilitythat miss bennet will receive every possible attention while sheremains with usmrs bennet was profuse in her acknowledgmentsi am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do notknow what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffersa vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which isalways the way with her for she has without exception the sweetesttemper i have ever met with i often tell my other girls they arenothing to her you have a sweet room here mr bingley and acharming prospect over the gravel walk i do not know a place in thecountry that is equal to netherfield you will not think of quitting itin a hurry i hope though you have but a short leasewhatever i do is done in a hurry replied he and therefore if ishould resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in fiveminutes at present however i consider myself as quite fixed herethat is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabethyou begin to comprehend me do you cried he turning towards heroh yesi understand you perfectlyi wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seenthrough i am afraid is pitifulthat is as it happens it does not follow that a deep intricatecharacter is more or less estimable than such a one as yourslizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on inthe wild
