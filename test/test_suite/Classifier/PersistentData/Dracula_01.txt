may bistritzleft munich at  p m on st may arriving atvienna early next morning should have arrived at  but train was anhour late budapesth seems a wonderful place from the glimpse which igot of it from the train and the little i could walk through thestreets i feared to go very far from the station as we had arrivedlate and would start as near the correct time as possible theimpression i had was that we were leaving the west and entering theeast the most western of splendid bridges over the danube which ishere of noble width and depth took us among the traditions of turkishrulewe left in pretty good time and came after nightfall to klausenburghhere i stopped for the night at the hotel royale i had for dinner orrather supper a chicken done up some way with red pepper which wasvery good but thirsty mem get recipe for mina i asked thewaiter and he said it was called paprika hendl and that as it was anational dish i should be able to get it anywhere along thecarpathians i found my smattering of german very useful here indeed idont know how i should be able to get on without ithaving had some time at my disposal when in london i had visited thebritish museum and made search among the books and maps in the libraryregarding transylvania it had struck me that some foreknowledge of thecountry could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with anobleman of that country i find that the district he named is in theextreme east of the country just on the borders of three statestransylvania moldavia and bukovina in the midst of the carpathianmountains one of the wildest and least known portions of europe i wasnot able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of thecastle dracula as there are no maps of this country as yet to comparewith our own ordnance survey maps but i found that bistritz the posttown named by count dracula is a fairly wellknown place i shall enterhere some of my notes as they may refresh my memory when i talk over mytravels with minain the population of transylvania there are four distinct nationalitiessaxons in the south and mixed with them the wallachs who are thedescendants of the dacians magyars in the west and szekelys in theeast and north i am going among the latter who claim to be descendedfrom attila and the huns this may be so for when the magyars conqueredthe country in the eleventh century they found the huns settled in it iread that every known superstition in the world is gathered into thehorseshoe of the carpathians as if it were the centre of some sort ofimaginative whirlpool if so my stay may be very interesting mem imust ask the count all about themi did not sleep well though my bed was comfortable enough for i hadall sorts of queer dreams there was a dog howling all night under mywindow which may have had something to do with it or it may have beenthe paprika for i had to drink up all the water in my carafe and wasstill thirsty towards morning i slept and was wakened by the continuousknocking at my door so i guess i must have been sleeping soundly theni had for breakfast more paprika and a sort of porridge of maize flourwhich they said was mamaliga and eggplant stuffed with forcemeat avery excellent dish which they call impletata mem get recipefor this also i had to hurry breakfast for the train started a littlebefore eight or rather it ought to have done so for after rushing tothe station at  i had to sit in the carriage for more than an hourbefore we began to move it seems to me that the further east you go themore unpunctual are the trains what ought they to be in chinaall day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full ofbeauty of every kind sometimes we saw little towns or castles on thetop of steep hills such as we see in old missals sometimes we ran byrivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each sideof them to be subject to great floods it takes a lot of water andrunning strong to sweep the outside edge of a river clear at everystation there were groups of people sometimes crowds and in all sortsof attire some of them were just like the peasants at home or those isaw coming through france and germany with short jackets and round hatsand homemade trousers but others were very picturesque the womenlooked pretty except when you got near them but they were very clumsyabout the waist they had all full white sleeves of some kind or otherand most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of somethingfluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet but of course therewere petticoats under them the strangest figures we saw were theslovaks who were more barbarian than the rest with their big cowboyhats great baggy dirtywhite trousers white linen shirts and enormousheavy leather belts nearly a foot wide all studded over with brassnails they wore high boots with their trousers tucked into them andhad long black hair and heavy black moustaches they are verypicturesque but do not look prepossessing on the stage they would beset down at once as some old oriental band of brigands they arehowever i am told very harmless and rather wanting in naturalselfassertionit was on the dark side of twilight when we got to bistritz which is avery interesting old place being practically on the frontierfor theborgo pass leads from it into bukovinait has had a very stormyexistence and it certainly shows marks of it fifty years ago a seriesof great fires took place which made terrible havoc on five separateoccasions at the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwenta siege of three weeks and lost  people the casualties of warproper being assisted by famine and diseasecount dracula had directed me to go to the golden krone hotel which ifound to my great delight to be thoroughly oldfashioned for ofcourse i wanted to see all i could of the ways of the country i wasevidently expected for when i got near the door i faced acheerylooking elderly woman in the usual peasant dresswhiteundergarment with long double apron front and back of coloured stufffitting almost too tight for modesty when i came close she bowed andsaid the herr englishman yes i said jonathan harker shesmiled and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirtsleeveswho had followed her to the door he went but immediately returned witha letter     my friendwelcome to the carpathians i am anxiously expecting     you sleep well tonight at three tomorrow the diligence will     start for bukovina a place on it is kept for you at the borgo     pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me i trust     that your journey from london has been a happy one and that you     will enjoy your stay in my beautiful landyour frienddracula mayi found that my landlord had got a letter from the countdirecting him to secure the best place on the coach for me but onmaking inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent andpretended that he could not understand my german this could not betrue because up to then he had understood it perfectly at least heanswered my questions exactly as if he did he and his wife the oldlady who had received me looked at each other in a frightened sort ofway he mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter and thatwas all he knew when i asked him if he knew count dracula and couldtell me anything of his castle both he and his wife crossed themselvesand saying that they knew nothing at all simply refused to speakfurther it was so near the time of starting that i had no time to askany one else for it was all very mysterious and not by any meanscomfortingjust before i was leaving the old lady came up to my room and said in avery hysterical waymust you go oh young herr must you go she was in such an excitedstate that she seemed to have lost her grip of what german she knew andmixed it all up with some other language which i did not know at all iwas just able to follow her by asking many questions when i told herthat i must go at once and that i was engaged on important businessshe asked againdo you know what day it is i answered that it was the fourth of mayshe shook her head as she said againoh yes i know that i know that but do you know what day it is onmy saying that i did not understand she went onit is the eve of st georges day do you not know that tonight whenthe clock strikes midnight all the evil things in the world will havefull sway do you know where you are going and what you are going toshe was in such evident distress that i tried to comfort her butwithout effect finally she went down on her knees and implored me notto go at least to wait a day or two before starting it was all veryridiculous but i did not feel comfortable however there was businessto be done and i could allow nothing to interfere with it i thereforetried to raise her up and said as gravely as i could that i thankedher but my duty was imperative and that i must go she then rose anddried her eyes and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me idid not know what to do for as an english churchman i have beentaught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous and yet itseemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such astate of mind she saw i suppose the doubt in my face for she put therosary round my neck and said for your mothers sake and went outof the room i am writing up this part of the diary whilst i am waitingfor the coach which is of course late and the crucifix is stillround my neck whether it is the old ladys fear or the many ghostlytraditions of this place or the crucifix itself i do not know but iam not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual if this book shouldever reach mina before i do let it bring my goodbye here comes thecoach                                    may the castlethe grey of the morning has passed and the sun ishigh over the distant horizon which seems jagged whether with trees orhills i know not for it is so far off that big things and little aremixed i am not sleepy and as i am not to be called till i awakenaturally i write till sleep comes there are many odd things to putdown and lest who reads them may fancy that i dined too well before ileft bistritz let me put down my dinner exactly i dined on what theycalled robber steakbits of bacon onion and beef seasoned with redpepper and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire in the simplestyle of the london cats meat the wine was golden mediasch whichproduces a queer sting on the tongue which is however notdisagreeable i had only a couple of glasses of this and nothing elsewhen i got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat and i saw himtalking with the landlady they were evidently talking of me for everynow and then they looked at me and some of the people who were sittingon the bench outside the doorwhich they call by a name meaningwordbearercame and listened and then looked at me most of thempityingly i could hear a lot of words often repeated queer words forthere were many nationalities in the crowd so i quietly got my polyglotdictionary from my bag and looked them out i must say they were notcheering to me for amongst them were ordogsatan pokolhellstregoicawitch vrolok and vlkoslakboth of which mean the samething one being slovak and the other servian for something that iseither werewolf or vampire mem i must ask the count about thesesuperstitionswhen we started the crowd round the inn door which had by this timeswelled to a considerable size all made the sign of the cross andpointed two fingers towards me with some difficulty i got afellowpassenger to tell me what they meant he would not answer atfirst but on learning that i was english he explained that it was acharm or guard against the evil eye this was not very pleasant for mejust starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man but every oneseemed so kindhearted and so sorrowful and so sympathetic that icould not but be touched i shall never forget the last glimpse which ihad of the innyard and its crowd of picturesque figures all crossingthemselves as they stood round the wide archway with its background ofrich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in thecentre of the yard then our driver whose wide linen drawers coveredthe whole front of the boxseatgotza they call themcracked his bigwhip over his four small horses which ran abreast and we set off onour journeyi soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of thescene as we drove along although had i known the language or ratherlanguages which my fellowpassengers were speaking i might not havebeen able to throw them off so easily before us lay a green slopingland full of forests and woods with here and there steep hills crownedwith clumps of trees or with farmhouses the blank gable end to theroad there was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossomappleplum pear cherry and as we drove by i could see the green grass underthe trees spangled with the fallen petals in and out amongst thesegreen hills of what they call here the mittel land ran the roadlosing itself as it swept round the grassy curve or was shut out by thestraggling ends of pine woods which here and there ran down thehillsides like tongues of flame the road was rugged but still weseemed to fly over it with a feverish haste i could not understand thenwhat the haste meant but the driver was evidently bent on losing notime in reaching borgo prund i was told that this road is in summertimeexcellent but that it had not yet been put in order after the wintersnows in this respect it is different from the general run of roads inthe carpathians for it is an old tradition that they are not to be keptin too good order of old the hospadars would not repair them lest theturk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troopsand so hasten the war which was always really at loading pointbeyond the green swelling hills of the mittel land rose mighty slopesof forest up to the lofty steeps of the carpathians themselves rightand left of us they towered with the afternoon sun falling full uponthem and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful rangedeep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks green and brown wheregrass and rock mingled and an endless perspective of jagged rock andpointed crags till these were themselves lost in the distance wherethe snowy peaks rose grandly here and there seemed mighty rifts in themountains through which as the sun began to sink we saw now and againthe white gleam of falling water one of my companions touched my arm aswe swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty snowcoveredpeak of a mountain which seemed as we wound on our serpentine way tobe right before uslook isten szekgods seatand he crossed himself reverentlyas we wound on our endless way and the sun sank lower and lower behindus the shadows of the evening began to creep round us this wasemphasised by the fact that the snowy mountaintop still held thesunset and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink here and therewe passed cszeks and slovaks all in picturesque attire but i noticedthat goitre was painfully prevalent by the roadside were many crossesand as we swept by my companions all crossed themselves here and therewas a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine who did not eventurn round as we approached but seemed in the selfsurrender ofdevotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world there weremany things new to me for instance hayricks in the trees and hereand there very beautiful masses of weeping birch their white stemsshining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves now andagain we passed a leiterwagonthe ordinary peasants cartwith itslong snakelike vertebra calculated to suit the inequalities of theroad on this were sure to be seated quite a group of homecomingpeasants the cszeks with their white and the slovaks with theircoloured sheepskins the latter carrying lancefashion their longstaves with axe at end as the evening fell it began to get very coldand the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness thegloom of the trees oak beech and pine though in the valleys whichran deep between the spurs of the hills as we ascended through thepass the dark firs stood out here and there against the background oflatelying snow sometimes as the road was cut through the pine woodsthat seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us great masses ofgreyness which here and there bestrewed the trees produced apeculiarly weird and solemn effect which carried on the thoughts andgrim fancies engendered earlier in the evening when the falling sunsetthrew into strange relief the ghostlike clouds which amongst thecarpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys sometimes thehills were so steep that despite our drivers haste the horses couldonly go slowly i wished to get down and walk up them as we do at homebut the driver would not hear of it no no he said you must notwalk here the dogs are too fierce and then he added with what heevidently meant for grim pleasantryfor he looked round to catch theapproving smile of the restand you may have enough of such mattersbefore you go to sleep the only stop he would make was a momentspause to light his lampswhen it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst thepassengers and they kept speaking to him one after the other asthough urging him to further speed he lashed the horses unmercifullywith his long whip and with wild cries of encouragement urged them onto further exertions then through the darkness i could see a sort ofpatch of grey light ahead of us as though there were a cleft in thehills the excitement of the passengers grew greater the crazy coachrocked on its great leather springs and swayed like a boat tossed on astormy sea i had to hold on the road grew more level and we appearedto fly along then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on eachside and to frown down upon us we were entering on the borgo pass oneby one several of the passengers offered me gifts which they pressedupon me with an earnestness which would take no denial these werecertainly of an odd and varied kind but each was given in simple goodfaith with a kindly word and a blessing and that strange mixture offearmeaning movements which i had seen outside the hotel atbistritzthe sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eyethen as we flew along the driver leaned forward and on each side thepassengers craning over the edge of the coach peered eagerly into thedarkness it was evident that something very exciting was eitherhappening or expected but though i asked each passenger no one wouldgive me the slightest explanation this state of excitement kept on forsome little time and at last we saw before us the pass opening out onthe eastern side there were dark rolling clouds overhead and in theair the heavy oppressive sense of thunder it seemed as though themountain range had separated two atmospheres and that now we had gotinto the thunderous one i was now myself looking out for the conveyancewhich was to take me to the count each moment i expected to see theglare of lamps through the blackness but all was dark the only lightwas the flickering rays of our own lamps in which the steam from ourharddriven horses rose in a white cloud we could see now the sandyroad lying white before us but there was on it no sign of a vehiclethe passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness which seemed to mockmy own disappointment i was already thinking what i had best do whenthe driver looking at his watch said to the others something which icould hardly hear it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone ithought it was an hour less than the time then turning to me he saidin german worse than my ownthere is no carriage here the herr is not expected after all he willnow come on to bukovina and return tomorrow or the next day betterthe next day whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh andsnort and plunge wildly so that the driver had to hold them up thenamongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossingof themselves a calèche with four horses drove up behind us overtookus and drew up beside the coach i could see from the flash of ourlamps as the rays fell on them that the horses were coalblack andsplendid animals they were driven by a tall man with a long brownbeard and a great black hat which seemed to hide his face from us icould only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes which seemed redin the lamplight as he turned to us he said to the driveryou are early tonight my friend the man stammered in replythe english herr was in a hurry to which the stranger repliedthat is why i suppose you wished him to go on to bukovina you cannotdeceive me my friend i know too much and my horses are swift as hespoke he smiled and the lamplight fell on a hardlooking mouth withvery red lips and sharplooking teeth as white as ivory one of mycompanions whispered to another the line from burgers lenore    denn die todten reiten schnell    for the dead travel fastthe strange driver evidently heard the words for he looked up with agleaming smile the passenger turned his face away at the same timeputting out his two fingers and crossing himself give me the herrsluggage said the driver and with exceeding alacrity my bags werehanded out and put in the calèche then i descended from the side of thecoach as the calèche was close alongside the driver helping me with ahand which caught my arm in a grip of steel his strength must have beenprodigious without a word he shook his reins the horses turned and weswept into the darkness of the pass as i looked back i saw the steamfrom the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps and projectedagainst it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves thenthe driver cracked his whip and called to his horses and off they swepton their way to bukovina as they sank into the darkness i felt astrange chill and a lonely feeling came over me but a cloak was thrownover my shoulders and a rug across my knees and the driver said inexcellent germanthe night is chill mein herr and my master the count bade me take allcare of you there is a flask of slivovitz the plum brandy of thecountry underneath the seat if you should require it i did not takeany but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same i felt alittle strangely and not a little frightened i think had there beenany alternative i should have taken it instead of prosecuting thatunknown night journey the carriage went at a hard pace straight alongthen we made a complete turn and went along another straight road itseemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same groundagain and so i took note of some salient point and found that this wasso i would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant buti really feared to do so for i thought that placed as i was anyprotest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention todelay byandby however as i was curious to know how time waspassing i struck a match and by its flame looked at my watch it waswithin a few minutes of midnight this gave me a sort of shock for isuppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by myrecent experiences i waited with a sick feeling of suspensethen a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the roadalong agonised wailing as if from fear the sound was taken up byanother dog and then another and another till borne on the wind whichnow sighed softly through the pass a wild howling began which seemedto come from all over the country as far as the imagination could graspit through the gloom of the night at the first howl the horses began tostrain and rear but the driver spoke to them soothingly and theyquieted down but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway fromsudden fright then far off in the distance from the mountains on eachside of us began a louder and a sharper howlingthat of wolveswhichaffected both the horses and myself in the same wayfor i was minded tojump from the calèche and run whilst they reared again and plungedmadly so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep themfrom bolting in a few minutes however my own ears got accustomed tothe sound and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was ableto descend and to stand before them he petted and soothed them andwhispered something in their ears as i have heard of horsetamersdoing and with extraordinary effect for under his caresses they becamequite manageable again though they still trembled the driver againtook his seat and shaking his reins started off at a great pace thistime after going to the far side of the pass he suddenly turned down anarrow roadway which ran sharply to the rightsoon we were hemmed in with trees which in places arched right over theroadway till we passed as through a tunnel and again great frowningrocks guarded us boldly on either side though we were in shelter wecould hear the rising wind for it moaned and whistled through therocks and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept alongit grew colder and colder still and fine powdery snow began to fallso that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket thekeen wind still carried the howling of the dogs though this grewfainter as we went on our way the baying of the wolves sounded nearerand nearer as though they were closing round on us from every side igrew dreadfully afraid and the horses shared my fear the driverhowever was not in the least disturbed he kept turning his head toleft and right but i could not see anything through the darknesssuddenly away on our left i saw a faint flickering blue flame thedriver saw it at the same moment he at once checked the horses andjumping to the ground disappeared into the darkness i did not knowwhat to do the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer but whilei wondered the driver suddenly appeared again and without a word tookhis seat and we resumed our journey i think i must have fallen asleepand kept dreaming of the incident for it seemed to be repeatedendlessly and now looking back it is like a sort of awful nightmareonce the flame appeared so near the road that even in the darknessaround us i could watch the drivers motions he went rapidly to wherethe blue flame aroseit must have been very faint for it did not seemto illumine the place around it at alland gathering a few stonesformed them into some device once there appeared a strange opticaleffect when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct itfor i could see its ghostly flicker all the same this startled me butas the effect was only momentary i took it that my eyes deceived mestraining through the darkness then for a time there were no blueflames and we sped onwards through the gloom with the howling of thewolves around us as though they were following in a moving circleat last there came a time when the driver went further afield than hehad yet gone and during his absence the horses began to tremble worsethan ever and to snort and scream with fright i could not see any causefor it for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether but justthen the moon sailing through the black clouds appeared behind thejagged crest of a beetling pineclad rock and by its light i sawaround us a ring of wolves with white teeth and lolling red tongueswith long sinewy limbs and shaggy hair they were a hundred times moreterrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howledfor myself i felt a sort of paralysis of fear it is only when a manfeels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understandtheir true importall at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had hadsome peculiar effect on them the horses jumped about and reared andlooked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to seebut the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side and theyhad perforce to remain within it i called to the coachman to come forit seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through thering and to aid his approach i shouted and beat the side of thecalèche hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side so asto give him a chance of reaching the trap how he came there i knownot but i heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command andlooking towards the sound saw him stand in the roadway as he swept hislong arms as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle the wolvesfell back and back further still just then a heavy cloud passed acrossthe face of the moon so that we were again in darknesswhen i could see again the driver was climbing into the calèche and thewolves had disappeared this was all so strange and uncanny that adreadful fear came upon me and i was afraid to speak or move the timeseemed interminable as we swept on our way now in almost completedarkness for the rolling clouds obscured the moon we kept onascending with occasional periods of quick descent but in the mainalways ascending suddenly i became conscious of the fact that thedriver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of avast ruined castle from whose tall black windows came no ray of lightand whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlitsky mayi must have been asleep for certainly if i had been fullyawake i must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place inthe gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size and as several darkways led from it under great round arches it perhaps seemed bigger thanit really is i have not yet been able to see it by daylightwhen the calèche stopped the driver jumped down and held out his handto assist me to alight again i could not but notice his prodigiousstrength his hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could havecrushed mine if he had chosen then he took out my traps and placedthem on the ground beside me as i stood close to a great door old andstudded with large iron nails and set in a projecting doorway ofmassive stone i could see even in the dim light that the stone wasmassively carved but that the carving had been much worn by time andweather as i stood the driver jumped again into his seat and shook thereins the horses started forward and trap and all disappeared down oneof the dark openingsi stood in silence where i was for i did not know what to do of bellor knocker there was no sign through these frowning walls and darkwindow openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate thetime i waited seemed endless and i felt doubts and fears crowding uponme what sort of place had i come to and among what kind of peoplewhat sort of grim adventure was it on which i had embarked was this acustomary incident in the life of a solicitors clerk sent out toexplain the purchase of a london estate to a foreigner solicitorsclerk mina would not like that solicitorfor just before leavinglondon i got word that my examination was successful and i am now afullblown solicitor i began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see ifi were awake it all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me and iexpected that i should suddenly awake and find myself at home withthe dawn struggling in through the windows as i had now and again feltin the morning after a day of overwork but my flesh answered thepinching test and my eyes were not to be deceived i was indeed awakeand among the carpathians all i could do now was to be patient and towait the coming of the morningjust as i had come to this conclusion i heard a heavy step approachingbehind the great door and saw through the chinks the gleam of a cominglight then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking ofmassive bolts drawn back a key was turned with the loud grating noiseof long disuse and the great door swung backwithin stood a tall old man clean shaven save for a long whitemoustache and clad in black from head to foot without a single speckof colour about him anywhere he held in his hand an antique silverlamp in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kindthrowing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of theopen door the old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtlygesture saying in excellent english but with a strange intonationwelcome to my house enter freely and of your own will he made nomotion of stepping to meet me but stood like a statue as though hisgesture of welcome had fixed him into stone the instant however thati had stepped over the threshold he moved impulsively forward andholding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wincean effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold asicemore like the hand of a dead than a living man again he saidwelcome to my house come freely go safely and leave something of thehappiness you bring the strength of the handshake was so much akin tothat which i had noticed in the driver whose face i had not seen thatfor a moment i doubted if it were not the same person to whom i wasspeaking so to make sure i said interrogativelycount dracula he bowed in a courtly way as he repliedi am dracula and i bid you welcome mr harker to my house come inthe night air is chill and you must need to eat and rest as he wasspeaking he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall and stepping outtook my luggage he had carried it in before i could forestall him iprotested but he insistednay sir you are my guest it is late and my people are notavailable let me see to your comfort myself he insisted on carryingmy traps along the passage and then up a great winding stair andalong another great passage on whose stone floor our steps rangheavily at the end of this he threw open a heavy door and i rejoicedto see within a welllit room in which a table was spread for supperand on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs freshly replenishedflamed and flaredthe count halted putting down my bags closed the door and crossingthe room opened another door which led into a small octagonal room litby a single lamp and seemingly without a window of any sort passingthrough this he opened another door and motioned me to enter it was awelcome sight for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed withanother log firealso added to but lately for the top logs werefreshwhich sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney the count himselfleft my luggage inside and withdrew saying before he closed thedooryou will need after your journey to refresh yourself by making yourtoilet i trust you will find all you wish when you are ready comeinto the other room where you will find your supper preparedthe light and warmth and the counts courteous welcome seemed to havedissipated all my doubts and fears having then reached my normal statei discovered that i was half famished with hunger so making a hastytoilet i went into the other roomi found supper already laid out my host who stood on one side of thegreat fireplace leaning against the stonework made a graceful wave ofhis hand to the table and saidi pray you be seated and sup how you please you will i trust excuseme that i do not join you but i have dined already and i do not supi handed to him the sealed letter which mr hawkins had entrusted to mehe opened it and read it gravely then with a charming smile he handedit to me to read one passage of it at least gave me a thrill ofpleasurei must regret that an attack of gout from which malady i am a constantsufferer forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time tocome but i am happy to say i can send a sufficient substitute one inwhom i have every possible confidence he is a young man full of energyand talent in his own way and of a very faithful disposition he isdiscreet and silent and has grown into manhood in my service he shallbe ready to attend on you when you will during his stay and shall takeyour instructions in all mattersthe count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish and ifell to at once on an excellent roast chicken this with some cheeseand a salad and a bottle of old tokay of which i had two glasses wasmy supper during the time i was eating it the count asked me manyquestions as to my journey and i told him by degrees all i hadexperiencedby this time i had finished my supper and by my hosts desire had drawnup a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered meat the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke i had now anopportunity of observing him and found him of a very markedphysiognomyhis face was a stronga very strongaquiline with high bridge of thethin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils with lofty domed forehead andhair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere hiseyebrows were very massive almost meeting over the nose and with bushyhair that seemed to curl in its own profusion the mouth so far as icould see it under the heavy moustache was fixed and rathercruellooking with peculiarly sharp white teeth these protruded overthe lips whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in aman of his years for the rest his ears were pale and at the topsextremely pointed the chin was broad and strong and the cheeks firmthough thin the general effect was one of extraordinary pallorhitherto i had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his kneesin the firelight and they had seemed rather white and fine but seeingthem now close to me i could not but notice that they were rathercoarsebroad with squat fingers strange to say there were hairs inthe centre of the palm the nails were long and fine and cut to a sharppoint as the count leaned over me and his hands touched me i could notrepress a shudder it may have been that his breath was rank but ahorrible feeling of nausea came over me which do what i would i couldnot conceal the count evidently noticing it drew back and with agrim sort of smile which showed more than he had yet done hisprotuberant teeth sat himself down again on his own side of thefireplace we were both silent for a while and as i looked towards thewindow i saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn there seemed astrange stillness over everything but as i listened i heard as if fromdown below in the valley the howling of many wolves the counts eyesgleamed and he saidlisten to themthe children of the night what music they makeseeing i suppose some expression in my face strange to him headdedah sir you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of thehunter then he rose and saidbut you must be tired your bedroom is all ready and tomorrow youshall sleep as late as you will i have to be away till the afternoonso sleep well and dream well with a courteous bow he opened for mehimself the door to the octagonal room and i entered my bedroomi am all in a sea of wonders i doubt i fear i think strange thingswhich i dare not confess to my own soul god keep me if only for thesake of those dear to me                                    mayit is again early morning but i have rested and enjoyed thelast twentyfour hours i slept till late in the day and awoke of myown accord when i had dressed myself i went into the room where we hadsupped and found a cold breakfast laid out with coffee kept hot by thepot being placed on the hearth there was a card on the table on whichwas writteni have to be absent for a while do not wait for med i set to andenjoyed a hearty meal when i had done i looked for a bell so that imight let the servants know i had finished but i could not find onethere are certainly odd deficiencies in the house considering theextraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me the table serviceis of gold and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense valuethe curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings ofmy bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics and must havebeen of fabulous value when they were made for they are centuries oldthough in excellent order i saw something like them in hampton courtbut there they were worn and frayed and motheaten but still in none ofthe rooms is there a mirror there is not even a toilet glass on mytable and i had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before icould either shave or brush my hair i have not yet seen a servantanywhere or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolvessome time after i had finished my meali do not know whether to call itbreakfast or dinner for it was between five and six oclock when i haditi looked about for something to read for i did not like to go aboutthe castle until i had asked the counts permission there wasabsolutely nothing in the room book newspaper or even writingmaterials so i opened another door in the room and found a sort oflibrary the door opposite mine i tried but found it lockedin the library i found to my great delight a vast number of englishbooks whole shelves full of them and bound volumes of magazines andnewspapers a table in the centre was littered with english magazinesand newspapers though none of them were of very recent date the bookswere of the most varied kindhistory geography politics politicaleconomy botany geology lawall relating to england and english lifeand customs and manners there were even such books of reference as thelondon directory the red and blue books whitakers almanac thearmy and navy lists andit somehow gladdened my heart to see itthelaw listwhilst i was looking at the books the door opened and the countentered he saluted me in a hearty way and hoped that i had had a goodnights rest then he went oni am glad you found your way in here for i am sure there is much thatwill interest you these companionsand he laid his hand on some ofthe bookshave been good friends to me and for some years past eversince i had the idea of going to london have given me many many hoursof pleasure through them i have come to know your great england and toknow her is to love her i long to go through the crowded streets ofyour mighty london to be in the midst of the whirl and rush ofhumanity to share its life its change its death and all that makesit what it is but alas as yet i only know your tongue through booksto you my friend i look that i know it to speakbut count i said you know and speak english thoroughly he bowedgravelyi thank you my friend for your all tooflattering estimate but yet ifear that i am but a little way on the road i would travel true i knowthe grammar and the words but yet i know not how to speak themindeed i said you speak excellentlynot so he answered well i know that did i move and speak in yourlondon none there are who would not know me for a stranger that is notenough for me here i am noble i am boyar the common people know meand i am master but a stranger in a strange land he is no one menknow him notand to know not is to care not for i am content if i amlike the rest so that no man stops if he see me or pause in hisspeaking if he hear my words ha ha a stranger i have been so longmaster that i would be master stillor at least that none other shouldbe master of me you come to me not alone as agent of my friend peterhawkins of exeter to tell me all about my new estate in london youshall i trust rest here with me awhile so that by our talking i maylearn the english intonation and i would that you tell me when i makeerror even of the smallest in my speaking i am sorry that i had to beaway so long today but you will i know forgive one who has so manyimportant affairs in handof course i said all i could about being willing and asked if i mightcome into that room when i chose he answered yes certainly andaddedyou may go anywhere you wish in the castle except where the doors arelocked where of course you will not wish to go there is reason thatall things are as they are and did you see with my eyes and know withmy knowledge you would perhaps better understand i said i was sure ofthis and then he went onwe are in transylvania and transylvania is not england our ways arenot your ways and there shall be to you many strange things nay fromwhat you have told me of your experiences already you know something ofwhat strange things there may bethis led to much conversation and as it was evident that he wanted totalk if only for talkings sake i asked him many questions regardingthings that had already happened to me or come within my noticesometimes he sheered off the subject or turned the conversation bypretending not to understand but generally he answered all i asked mostfrankly then as time went on and i had got somewhat bolder i askedhim of some of the strange things of the preceding night as forinstance why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blueflames he then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on acertain night of the yearlast night in fact when all evil spiritsare supposed to have unchecked swaya blue flame is seen over any placewhere treasure has been concealed that treasure has been hidden hewent on in the region through which you came last night there can bebut little doubt for it was the ground fought over for centuries by thewallachian the saxon and the turk why there is hardly a foot of soilin all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of menpatriots or invaders in old days there were stirring times when theaustrian and the hungarian came up in hordes and the patriots went outto meet themmen and women the aged and the children tooand waitedtheir coming on the rocks above the passes that they might sweepdestruction on them with their artificial avalanches when the invaderwas triumphant he found but little for whatever there was had beensheltered in the friendly soilbut how said i can it have remained so long undiscovered whenthere is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to lookthe count smiled and as his lips ran back over his gums the longsharp canine teeth showed out strangely he answeredbecause your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool those flames onlyappear on one night and on that night no man of this land will if hecan help it stir without his doors and dear sir even if he did hewould not know what to do why even the peasant that you tell me of whomarked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylighteven for his own work even you would not i dare be sworn be able tofind these places againthere you are right i said i know no more than the dead where evento look for them then we drifted into other matterscome he said at last tell me of london and of the house which youhave procured for me with an apology for my remissness i went into myown room to get the papers from my bag whilst i was placing them inorder i heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room and as ipassed through noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamplit for it was by this time deep into the dark the lamps were also litin the study or library and i found the count lying on the sofareading of all things in the world an english bradshaws guide when icame in he cleared the books and papers from the table and with him iwent into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts he was interested ineverything and asked me a myriad questions about the place and itssurroundings he clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on thesubject of the neighbourhood for he evidently at the end knew very muchmore than i did when i remarked this he answeredwell but my friend is it not needful that i should when i go therei shall be all alone and my friend harker jonathannay pardon me ifall into my countrys habit of putting your patronymic firstmy friendjonathan harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me he will bein exeter miles away probably working at papers of the law with myother friend peter hawkins sowe went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate atpurfleet when i had told him the facts and got his signature to thenecessary papers and had written a letter with them ready to post tomr hawkins he began to ask me how i had come across so suitable aplace i read to him the notes which i had made at the time and which iinscribe hereat purfleet on a byroad i came across just such a place as seemed tobe required and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the placewas for sale it is surrounded by a high wall of ancient structurebuilt of heavy stones and has not been repaired for a large number ofyears the closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron all eaten withrustthe estate is called carfax no doubt a corruption of the old quatreface as the house is foursided agreeing with the cardinal points ofthe compass it contains in all some twenty acres quite surrounded bythe solid stone wall above mentioned there are many trees on it whichmake it in places gloomy and there is a deep darklooking pond orsmall lake evidently fed by some springs as the water is clear andflows away in a fairsized stream the house is very large and of allperiods back i should say to mediæval times for one part is of stoneimmensely thick with only a few windows high up and heavily barred withiron it looks like part of a keep and is close to an old chapel orchurch i could not enter it as i had not the key of the door leadingto it from the house but i have taken with my kodak views of it fromvarious points the house has been added to but in a very stragglingway and i can only guess at the amount of ground it covers which mustbe very great there are but few houses close at hand one being a verylarge house only recently added to and formed into a private lunaticasylum it is not however visible from the groundswhen i had finished he saidi am glad that it is old and big i myself am of an old family and tolive in a new house would kill me a house cannot be made habitable in aday and after all how few days go to make up a century i rejoicealso that there is a chapel of old times we transylvanian nobles lovenot to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead i seek notgaiety nor mirth not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine andsparkling waters which please the young and gay i am no longer youngand my heart through weary years of mourning over the dead is notattuned to mirth moreover the walls of my castle are broken theshadows are many and the wind breathes cold through the brokenbattlements and casements i love the shade and the shadow and wouldbe alone with my thoughts when i may somehow his words and his lookdid not seem to accord or else it was that his cast of face made hissmile look malignant and saturninepresently with an excuse he left me asking me to put all my paperstogether he was some little time away and i began to look at some ofthe books around me one was an atlas which i found opened naturally atengland as if that map had been much used on looking at it i found incertain places little rings marked and on examining these i noticedthat one was near london on the east side manifestly where his newestate was situated the other two were exeter and whitby on theyorkshire coastit was the better part of an hour when the count returned aha hesaid still at your books good but you must not work always come iam informed that your supper is ready he took my arm and we went intothe next room where i found an excellent supper ready on the table thecount again excused himself as he had dined out on his being away fromhome but he sat as on the previous night and chatted whilst i ateafter supper i smoked as on the last evening and the count stayed withme chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject hourafter hour i felt that it was getting very late indeed but i did notsay anything for i felt under obligation to meet my hosts wishes inevery way i was not sleepy as the long sleep yesterday had fortifiedme but i could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one atthe coming of the dawn which is like in its way the turn of the tidethey say that people who are near death die generally at the change tothe dawn or at the turn of the tide any one who has when tired andtied as it were to his post experienced this change in the atmospherecan well believe it all at once we heard the crow of a cock coming upwith preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air countdracula jumping to his feet saidwhy there is the morning again how remiss i am to let you stay up solong you must make your conversation regarding my dear new country ofengland less interesting so that i may not forget how time flies byus and with a courtly bow he quickly left mei went into my own room and drew the curtains but there was little tonotice my window opened into the courtyard all i could see was thewarm grey of quickening sky so i pulled the curtains again and havewritten of this day                                    mayi began to fear as i wrote in this book that i was getting toodiffuse but now i am glad that i went into detail from the first forthere is something so strange about this place and all in it that icannot but feel uneasy i wish i were safe out of it or that i hadnever come it may be that this strange nightexistence is telling onme but would that that were all if there were any one to talk to icould bear it but there is no one i have only the count to speak withand hei fear i am myself the only living soul within the place letme be prosaic so far as facts can be it will help me to bear up andimagination must not run riot with me if it does i am lost let me sayat once how i standor seem toi only slept a few hours when i went to bed and feeling that i couldnot sleep any more got up i had hung my shaving glass by the windowand was just beginning to shave suddenly i felt a hand on my shoulderand heard the counts voice saying to me goodmorning i started forit amazed me that i had not seen him since the reflection of the glasscovered the whole room behind me in starting i had cut myself slightlybut did not notice it at the moment having answered the countssalutation i turned to the glass again to see how i had been mistakenthis time there could be no error for the man was close to me and icould see him over my shoulder but there was no reflection of him inthe mirror the whole room behind me was displayed but there was nosign of a man in it except myself this was startling and coming onthe top of so many strange things was beginning to increase that vaguefeeling of uneasiness which i always have when the count is near but atthe instant i saw that the cut had bled a little and the blood wastrickling over my chin i laid down the razor turning as i did so halfround to look for some sticking plaster when the count saw my face hiseyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury and he suddenly made a grab atmy throat i drew away and his hand touched the string of beads whichheld the crucifix it made an instant change in him for the fury passedso quickly that i could hardly believe that it was ever theretake care he said take care how you cut yourself it is moredangerous than you think in this country then seizing the shavingglass he went on and this is the wretched thing that has done themischief it is a foul bauble of mans vanity away with it andopening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand he flungout the glass which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stonesof the courtyard far below then he withdrew without a word it is veryannoying for i do not see how i am to shave unless in my watchcase orthe bottom of the shavingpot which is fortunately of metalwhen i went into the diningroom breakfast was prepared but i couldnot find the count anywhere so i breakfasted alone it is strange thatas yet i have not seen the count eat or drink he must be a verypeculiar man after breakfast i did a little exploring in the castle iwent out on the stairs and found a room looking towards the south theview was magnificent and from where i stood there was every opportunityof seeing it the castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice astone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet withouttouching anything as far as the eye can reach is a sea of green treetops with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm here andthere are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges throughthe forestsbut i am not in heart to describe beauty for when i had seen the view iexplored further doors doors doors everywhere and all locked andbolted in no place save from the windows in the castle walls is therean available exitthe castle is a veritable prison and i am a prisonerwhen i found that i was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over mei rushed up and down the stairs trying every door and peering out ofevery window i could find but after a little the conviction of myhelplessness overpowered all other feelings when i look back after afew hours i think i must have been mad for the time for i behaved muchas a rat does in a trap when however the conviction had come to methat i was helpless i sat down quietlyas quietly as i have ever doneanything in my lifeand began to think over what was best to be done iam thinking still and as yet have come to no definite conclusion ofone thing only am i certain that it is no use making my ideas known tothe count he knows well that i am imprisoned and as he has done ithimself and has doubtless his own motives for it he would only deceiveme if i trusted him fully with the facts so far as i can see my onlyplan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself and my eyesopen i am i know either being deceived like a baby by my own fearsor else i am in desperate straits and if the latter be so i need andshall need all my brains to get throughi had hardly come to this conclusion when i heard the great door belowshut and knew that the count had returned he did not come at once intothe library so i went cautiously to my own room and found him makingthe bed this was odd but only confirmed what i had all alongthoughtthat there were no servants in the house when later i saw himthrough the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in thediningroom i was assured of it for if he does himself all thesemenial offices surely it is proof that there is no one else to do themthis gave me a fright for if there is no one else in the castle itmust have been the count himself who was the driver of the coach thatbrought me here this is a terrible thought for if so what does itmean that he could control the wolves as he did by only holding up hishand in silence how was it that all the people at bistritz and on thecoach had some terrible fear for me what meant the giving of thecrucifix of the garlic of the wild rose of the mountain ash blessthat good good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck for it is acomfort and a strength to me whenever i touch it it is odd that a thingwhich i have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrousshould in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help is it that thereis something in the essence of the thing itself or that it is a mediuma tangible help in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort sometime if it may be i must examine this matter and try to make up mymind about it in the meantime i must find out all i can about countdracula as it may help me to understand tonight he may talk ofhimself if i turn the conversation that way i must be very carefulhowever not to awake his suspicion                                   midnighti have had a long talk with the count i asked him a fewquestions on transylvania history and he warmed up to the subjectwonderfully in his speaking of things and people and especially ofbattles he spoke as if he had been present at them all this heafterwards explained by saying that to a boyar the pride of his houseand name is his own pride that their glory is his glory that theirfate is his fate whenever he spoke of his house he always said weand spoke almost in the plural like a king speaking i wish i could putdown all he said exactly as he said it for to me it was mostfascinating it seemed to have in it a whole history of the country hegrew excited as he spoke and walked about the room pulling his greatwhite moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands asthough he would crush it by main strength one thing he said which ishall put down as nearly as i can for it tells in its way the story ofhis racewe szekelys have a right to be proud for in our veins flows the bloodof many brave races who fought as the lion fights for lordship herein the whirlpool of european races the ugric tribe bore down fromiceland the fighting spirit which thor and wodin gave them which theirberserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of europe ayand of asia and africa too till the peoples thought that thewerewolves themselves had come here too when they came they foundthe huns whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flametill the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of thoseold witches who expelled from scythia had mated with the devils in thedesert fools fools what devil or what witch was ever so great asattila whose blood is in these veins he held up his arms is it awonder that we were a conquering race that we were proud that when themagyar the lombard the avar the bulgar or the turk poured histhousands on our frontiers we drove them back is it strange that whenarpad and his legions swept through the hungarian fatherland he found ushere when he reached the frontier that the honfoglalas was completedthere and when the hungarian flood swept eastward the szekelys wereclaimed as kindred by the victorious magyars and to us for centurieswas trusted the guarding of the frontier of turkeyland ay and morethan that endless duty of the frontier guard for as the turks saywater sleeps and enemy is sleepless who more gladly than wethroughout the four nations received the bloody sword or at itswarlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the king when wasredeemed that great shame of my nation the shame of cassova when theflags of the wallach and the magyar went down beneath the crescent whowas it but one of my own race who as voivode crossed the danube and beatthe turk on his own ground this was a dracula indeed woe was it thathis own unworthy brother when he had fallen sold his people to theturk and brought the shame of slavery on them was it not this draculaindeed who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again andagain brought his forces over the great river into turkeyland whowhen he was beaten back came again and again and again though he hadto come alone from the bloody field where his troops were beingslaughtered since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph theysaid that he thought only of himself bah what good are peasantswithout a leader where ends the war without a brain and heart toconduct it again when after the battle of mohács we threw off thehungarian yoke we of the dracula blood were amongst their leaders forour spirit would not brook that we were not free ah young sir theszekelysand the dracula as their hearts blood their brains andtheir swordscan boast a record that mushroom growths like thehapsburgs and the romanoffs can never reach the warlike days are overblood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace andthe glories of the great races are as a tale that is toldit was by this time close on morning and we went to bed mem thisdiary seems horribly like the beginning of the arabian nights foreverything has to break off at cockcrowor like the ghost of hamletsfather                                    maylet me begin with factsbare meagre facts verified bybooks and figures and of which there can be no doubt i must notconfuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my ownobservation or my memory of them last evening when the count came fromhis room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on thedoing of certain kinds of business i had spent the day wearily overbooks and simply to keep my mind occupied went over some of thematters i had been examined in at lincolns inn there was a certainmethod in the counts inquiries so i shall try to put them down insequence the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to mefirst he asked if a man in england might have two solicitors or more itold him he might have a dozen if he wished but that it would not bewise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction as onlyone could act at a time and that to change would be certain to militateagainst his interest he seemed thoroughly to understand and went on toask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man toattend say to banking and another to look after shipping in caselocal help were needed in a place far from the home of the bankingsolicitor i asked him to explain more fully so that i might not by anychance mislead him so he saidi shall illustrate your friend and mine mr peter hawkins from underthe shadow of your beautiful cathedral at exeter which is far fromlondon buys for me through your good self my place at london good nowhere let me say frankly lest you should think it strange that i havesought the services of one so far off from london instead of some oneresident there that my motive was that no local interest might beserved save my wish only and as one of london residence might perhapshave some purpose of himself or friend to serve i went thus afield toseek my agent whose labours should be only to my interest now supposei who have much of affairs wish to ship goods say to newcastle ordurham or harwich or dover might it not be that it could with moreease be done by consigning to one in these ports i answered thatcertainly it would be most easy but that we solicitors had a system ofagency one for the other so that local work could be done locally oninstruction from any solicitor so that the client simply placinghimself in the hands of one man could have his wishes carried out byhim without further troublebut said he i could be at liberty to direct myself is it not soof course i replied and such is often done by men of business whodo not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one persongood he said and then went on to ask about the means of makingconsignments and the forms to be gone through and of all sorts ofdifficulties which might arise but by forethought could be guardedagainst i explained all these things to him to the best of my abilityand he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made awonderful solicitor for there was nothing that he did not think of orforesee for a man who was never in the country and who did notevidently do much in the way of business his knowledge and acumen werewonderful when he had satisfied himself on these points of which he hadspoken and i had verified all as well as i could by the booksavailable he suddenly stood up and saidhave you written since your first letter to our friend mr peterhawkins or to any other it was with some bitterness in my heart thati answered that i had not that as yet i had not seen any opportunity ofsending letters to anybodythen write now my young friend he said laying a heavy hand on myshoulder write to our friend and to any other and say if it willplease you that you shall stay with me until a month from nowdo you wish me to stay so long i asked for my heart grew cold at thethoughti desire it much nay i will take no refusal when your masteremployer what you will engaged that someone should come on his behalfit was understood that my needs only were to be consulted i have notstinted is it not sowhat could i do but bow acceptance it was mr hawkinss interest notmine and i had to think of him not myself and besides while countdracula was speaking there was that in his eyes and in his bearingwhich made me remember that i was a prisoner and that if i wished it icould have no choice the count saw his victory in my bow and hismastery in the trouble of my face for he began at once to use them butin his own smooth resistless wayi pray you my good young friend that you will not discourse of thingsother than business in your letters it will doubtless please yourfriends to know that you are well and that you look forward to gettinghome to them is it not so as he spoke he handed me three sheets ofnotepaper and three envelopes they were all of the thinnest foreignpost and looking at them then at him and noticing his quiet smilewith the sharp canine teeth lying over the red underlip i understoodas well as if he had spoken that i should be careful what i wrote forhe would be able to read it so i determined to write only formal notesnow but to write fully to mr hawkins in secret and also to mina forto her i could write in shorthand which would puzzle the count if hedid see it when i had written my two letters i sat quiet reading abook whilst the count wrote several notes referring as he wrote them tosome books on his table then he took up my two and placed them with hisown and put by his writing materials after which the instant the doorhad closed behind him i leaned over and looked at the letters whichwere face down on the table i felt no compunction in doing so forunder the circumstances i felt that i should protect myself in every wayi couldone of the letters was directed to samuel f billington no  thecrescent whitby another to herr leutner varna the third was tocoutts  co london and the fourth to herren klopstock  billreuthbankers budapesth the second and fourth were unsealed i was justabout to look at them when i saw the doorhandle move i sank back in myseat having just had time to replace the letters as they had been andto resume my book before the count holding still another letter in hishand entered the room he took up the letters on the table and stampedthem carefully and then turning to me saidi trust you will forgive me but i have much work to do in private thisevening you will i hope find all things as you wish at the door heturned and after a moments pause saidlet me advise you my dear young friendnay let me warn you with allseriousness that should you leave these rooms you will not by anychance go to sleep in any other part of the castle it is old and hasmany memories and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely bewarned should sleep now or ever overcome you or be like to do thenhaste to your own chamber or to these rooms for your rest will then besafe but if you be not careful in this respect thenhe finished hisspeech in a gruesome way for he motioned with his hands as if he werewashing them i quite understood my only doubt was as to whether anydream could be more terrible than the unnatural horrible net of gloomand mystery which seemed closing around me                                   lateri endorse the last words written but this time there is nodoubt in question i shall not fear to sleep in any place where he isnot i have placed the crucifix over the head of my bedi imagine thatmy rest is thus freer from dreams and there it shall remainwhen he left me i went to my room after a little while not hearing anysound i came out and went up the stone stair to where i could look outtowards the south there was some sense of freedom in the vast expanseinaccessible though it was to me as compared with the narrow darknessof the courtyard looking out on this i felt that i was indeed inprison and i seemed to want a breath of fresh air though it were ofthe night i am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on meit is destroying my nerve i start at my own shadow and am full of allsorts of horrible imaginings god knows that there is ground for myterrible fear in this accursed place i looked out over the beautifulexpanse bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light asday in the soft light the distant hills became melted and the shadowsin the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness the mere beauty seemedto cheer me there was peace and comfort in every breath i drew as ileaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving a storeybelow me and somewhat to my left where i imagined from the order ofthe rooms that the windows of the counts own room would look out thewindow at which i stood was tall and deep stonemullioned and thoughweatherworn was still complete but it was evidently many a day sincethe case had been there i drew back behind the stonework and lookedcarefully outwhat i saw was the counts head coming out from the window i did notsee the face but i knew the man by the neck and the movement of hisback and arms in any case i could not mistake the hands which i had hadso many opportunities of studying i was at first interested andsomewhat amused for it is wonderful how small a matter will interestand amuse a man when he is a prisoner but my very feelings changed torepulsion and terror when i saw the whole man slowly emerge from thewindow and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyssface down with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings atfirst i could not believe my eyes i thought it was some trick of themoonlight some weird effect of shadow but i kept looking and it couldbe no delusion i saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of thestones worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years and by thususing every projection and inequality move downwards with considerablespeed just as a lizard moves along a wallwhat manner of man is this or what manner of creature is it in thesemblance of man i feel the dread of this horrible place overpoweringme i am in fearin awful fearand there is no escape for me i amencompassed about with terrors that i dare not think of                                    mayonce more have i seen the count go out in his lizard fashionhe moved downwards in a sidelong way some hundred feet down and a gooddeal to the left he vanished into some hole or window when his headhad disappeared i leaned out to try and see more but withoutavailthe distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight iknew he had left the castle now and thought to use the opportunity toexplore more than i had dared to do as yet i went back to the room andtaking a lamp tried all the doors they were all locked as i hadexpected and the locks were comparatively new but i went down thestone stairs to the hall where i had entered originally i found i couldpull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains but thedoor was locked and the key was gone that key must be in the countsroom i must watch should his door be unlocked so that i may get it andescape i went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairsand passages and to try the doors that opened from them one or twosmall rooms near the hall were open but there was nothing to see inthem except old furniture dusty with age and motheaten at lasthowever i found one door at the top of the stairway which though itseemed to be locked gave a little under pressure i tried it harderand found that it was not really locked but that the resistance camefrom the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat and the heavy doorrested on the floor here was an opportunity which i might not haveagain so i exerted myself and with many efforts forced it back so thati could enter i was now in a wing of the castle further to the rightthan the rooms i knew and a storey lower down from the windows i couldsee that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle thewindows of the end room looking out both west and south on the latterside as well as to the former there was a great precipice the castlewas built on the corner of a great rock so that on three sides it wasquite impregnable and great windows were placed here where sling orbow or culverin could not reach and consequently light and comfortimpossible to a position which had to be guarded were secured to thewest was a great valley and then rising far away great jaggedmountain fastnesses rising peak on peak the sheer rock studded withmountain ash and thorn whose roots clung in cracks and crevices andcrannies of the stone this was evidently the portion of the castleoccupied by the ladies in bygone days for the furniture had more air ofcomfort than any i had seen the windows were curtainless and theyellow moonlight flooding in through the diamond panes enabled one tosee even colours whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay overall and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth mylamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight but i wasglad to have it with me for there was a dread loneliness in the placewhich chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble still it was betterthan living alone in the rooms which i had come to hate from thepresence of the count and after trying a little to school my nerves ifound a soft quietude come over me here i am sitting at a little oaktable where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen with muchthought and many blushes her illspelt loveletter and writing in mydiary in shorthand all that has happened since i closed it last it isnineteenth century uptodate with a vengeance and yet unless mysenses deceive me the old centuries had and have powers of their ownwhich mere modernity cannot kill                                   later the morning of  maygod preserve my sanity for to this iam reduced safety and the assurance of safety are things of the pastwhilst i live on here there is but one thing to hope for that i may notgo mad if indeed i be not mad already if i be sane then surely itis maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in thishateful place the count is the least dreadful to me that to him alone ican look for safety even though this be only whilst i can serve hispurpose great god merciful god let me be calm for out of that waylies madness indeed i begin to get new lights on certain things whichhave puzzled me up to now i never quite knew what shakespeare meantwhen he made hamlet say    my tablets quick my tablets    tis meet that i put it down etcfor now feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the shockhad come which must end in its undoing i turn to my diary for reposethe habit of entering accurately must help to soothe methe counts mysterious warning frightened me at the time it frightensme more now when i think of it for in future he has a fearful hold uponme i shall fear to doubt what he may saywhen i had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book andpen in my pocket i felt sleepy the counts warning came into my mindbut i took a pleasure in disobeying it the sense of sleep was upon meand with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider the softmoonlight soothed and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedomwhich refreshed me i determined not to return tonight to thegloomhaunted rooms but to sleep here where of old ladies had satand sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad fortheir menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars i drew a greatcouch out of its place near the corner so that as i lay i could lookat the lovely view to east and south and unthinking of and uncaring forthe dust composed myself for sleep i suppose i must have fallenasleep i hope so but i fear for all that followed was startlinglyrealso real that now sitting here in the broad full sunlight of themorning i cannot in the least believe that it was all sleepi was not alone the room was the same unchanged in any way since icame into it i could see along the floor in the brilliant moonlightmy own footsteps marked where i had disturbed the long accumulation ofdust in the moonlight opposite me were three young women ladies bytheir dress and manner i thought at the time that i must be dreamingwhen i saw them for though the moonlight was behind them they threwno shadow on the floor they came close to me and looked at me for sometime and then whispered together two were dark and had high aquilinenoses like the count and great dark piercing eyes that seemed to bealmost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon the other wasfair as fair as can be with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyeslike pale sapphires i seemed somehow to know her face and to know itin connection with some dreamy fear but i could not recollect at themoment how or where all three had brilliant white teeth that shone likepearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips there was somethingabout them that made me uneasy some longing and at the same time somedeadly fear i felt in my heart a wicked burning desire that they wouldkiss me with those red lips it is not good to note this down lest someday it should meet minas eyes and cause her pain but it is the truththey whispered together
