you dont know about me without you have read a book by the name of theadventures of tom sawyer but that aint no matter  that book was madeby mr mark twain and he told the truth mainly  there was thingswhich he stretched but mainly he told the truth  that is nothing  inever seen anybody but lied one time or another without it was auntpolly or the widow or maybe mary  aunt pollytoms aunt polly sheisand mary and the widow douglas is all told about in that book whichis mostly a true book with some stretchers as i said beforenow the way that the book winds up is this  tom and me found the moneythat the robbers hid in the cave and it made us rich  we got sixthousand dollars apieceall gold  it was an awful sight of money whenit was piled up  well judge thatcher he took it and put it outat interest and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the yearroundmore than a body could tell what to do with  the widow douglasshe took me for her son and allowed she would sivilize me but it wasrough living in the house all the time considering how dismal regularand decent the widow was in all her ways and so when i couldnt standit no longer i lit out  i got into my old rags and my sugarhogsheadagain and was free and satisfied  but tom sawyer he hunted me up andsaid he was going to start a band of robbers and i might join if iwould go back to the widow and be respectable  so i went backthe widow she cried over me and called me a poor lost lamb and shecalled me a lot of other names too but she never meant no harm byit she put me in them new clothes again and i couldnt do nothing butsweat and sweat and feel all cramped up  well then the old thingcommenced again  the widow rung a bell for supper and you had to cometo time when you got to the table you couldnt go right to eating butyou had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a littleover the victuals though there warnt really anything the matter withthemthat is nothing only everything was cooked by itself  in abarrel of odds and ends it is different things get mixed up and thejuice kind of swaps around and the things go betterafter supper she got out her book and learned me about moses and thebulrushers and i was in a sweat to find out all about him but by andby she let it out that moses had been dead a considerable long time sothen i didnt care no more about him because i dont take no stock indead peoplepretty soon i wanted to smoke and asked the widow to let me  but shewouldnt  she said it was a mean practice and wasnt clean and i musttry to not do it any more  that is just the way with some people  theyget down on a thing when they dont know nothing about it  here she wasabothering about moses which was no kin to her and no use to anybodybeing gone you see yet finding a power of fault with me for doing athing that had some good in it  and she took snuff too of course thatwas all right because she done it herselfher sister miss watson a tolerable slim old maid with goggles onhad just come to live with her and took a set at me now with aspellingbook she worked me middling hard for about an hour and thenthe widow made her ease up  i couldnt stood it much longer  then foran hour it was deadly dull and i was fidgety  miss watson would saydont put your feet up there huckleberry and dont scrunch uplike that huckleberryset up straight and pretty soon she wouldsay dont gap and stretch like that huckleberrywhy dont you try tobehave  then she told me all about the bad place and i said i wishedi was there she got mad then but i didnt mean no harm  all i wantedwas to go somewheres all i wanted was a change i warnt particular she said it was wicked to say what i said said she wouldnt say it forthe whole world she was going to live so as to go to the good place well i couldnt see no advantage in going where she was going so imade up my mind i wouldnt try for it  but i never said so because itwould only make trouble and wouldnt do no goodnow she had got a start and she went on and told me all about the goodplace  she said all a body would have to do there was to go around allday long with a harp and sing forever and ever  so i didnt thinkmuch of it but i never said so  i asked her if she reckoned tom sawyerwould go there and she said not by a considerable sight  i was gladabout that because i wanted him and me to be togethermiss watson she kept pecking at me and it got tiresome and lonesome by and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers and theneverybody was off to bed  i went up to my room with a piece of candleand put it on the table  then i set down in a chair by the window andtried to think of something cheerful but it warnt no use  i feltso lonesome i most wished i was dead  the stars were shining and theleaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful and i heard an owl awayoff whowhooing about somebody that was dead and a whippowill and adog crying about somebody that was going to die and the wind was tryingto whisper something to me and i couldnt make out what it was and soit made the cold shivers run over me then away out in the woods i heardthat kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell aboutsomething thats on its mind and cant make itself understood and socant rest easy in its grave and has to go about that way every nightgrieving  i got so downhearted and scared i did wish i had somecompany  pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder and iflipped it off and it lit in the candle and before i could budge itwas all shriveled up  i didnt need anybody to tell me that that wasan awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck so i was scaredand most shook the clothes off of me i got up and turned around in mytracks three times and crossed my breast every time and then i tiedup a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away  buti hadnt no confidence  you do that when youve lost a horseshoe thatyouve found instead of nailing it up over the door but i hadnt everheard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when youd killeda spideri set down again ashaking all over and got out my pipe for a smokefor the house was all as still as death now and so the widow wouldntknow well after a long time i heard the clock away off in the towngo boomboomboomtwelve licks and all still againstiller thanever pretty soon i heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst thetreessomething was a stirring  i set still and listened  directly icould just barely hear a meyow meyow down there  that was good says i meyow meyow as soft as i could and then i put out thelight and scrambled out of the window on to the shed  then i slippeddown to the ground and crawled in among the trees and sure enoughthere was tom sawyer waiting for mewe went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end ofthe widows garden stooping down so as the branches wouldnt scrape ourheads when we was passing by the kitchen i fell over a root and madea noise  we scrouched down and laid still  miss watsons big niggernamed jim was setting in the kitchen door we could see him prettyclear because there was a light behind him  he got up and stretchedhis neck out about a minute listening  then he sayswho dahhe listened some more then he come tiptoeing down and stood rightbetween us we could a touched him nearly  well likely it wasminutes and minutes that there warnt a sound and we all there so closetogether  there was a place on my ankle that got to itching but idasnt scratch it and then my ear begun to itch and next my backright between my shoulders  seemed like id die if i couldnt scratch well ive noticed that thing plenty times since  if you are withthe quality or at a funeral or trying to go to sleep when you aintsleepyif you are anywheres where it wont do for you to scratch whyyou will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places pretty soon jimsayssay who is you  whar is you  dog my cats ef i didn hear sumfnwell i know what is gwyne to do  is gwyne to set down here andlisten tell i hears it aginso he set down on the ground betwixt me and tom  he leaned his back upagainst a tree and stretched his legs out till one of them most touchedone of mine  my nose begun to itch  it itched till the tears come intomy eyes  but i dasnt scratch  then it begun to itch on the insidenext i got to itching underneath  i didnt know how i was going to setstill this miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes butit seemed a sight longer than that  i was itching in eleven differentplaces now  i reckoned i couldnt stand it moren a minute longerbut i set my teeth hard and got ready to try  just then jim begunto breathe heavy next he begun to snoreand then i was pretty sooncomfortable againtom he made a sign to mekind of a little noise with his mouthand wewent creeping away on our hands and knees  when we was ten foot off tomwhispered to me and wanted to tie jim to the tree for fun  but i saidno he might wake and make a disturbance and then theyd find out iwarnt in then tom said he hadnt got candles enough and he would slipin the kitchen and get some more  i didnt want him to try  i said jimmight wake up and come  but tom wanted to resk it so we slid in thereand got three candles and tom laid five cents on the table for paythen we got out and i was in a sweat to get away but nothing would dotom but he must crawl to where jim was on his hands and knees and playsomething on him  i waited and it seemed a good while everything wasso still and lonesomeas soon as tom was back we cut along the path around the garden fenceand by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side ofthe house  tom said he slipped jims hat off of his head and hung iton a limb right over him and jim stirred a little but he didnt wakeafterwards jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a tranceand rode him all over the state and then set him under the trees againand hung his hat on a limb to show who done it  and next time jim toldit he said they rode him down to new orleans and after that everytime he told it he spread it more and more till by and by he said theyrode him all over the world and tired him most to death and his backwas all over saddleboils  jim was monstrous proud about it and hegot so he wouldnt hardly notice the other niggers  niggers would comemiles to hear jim tell about it and he was more looked up to than anynigger in that country  strange niggers would stand with their mouthsopen and look him all over same as if he was a wonder  niggers isalways talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire butwhenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such thingsjim would happen in and say hm  what you know bout witches andthat nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat  jim always keptthat fivecenter piece round his neck with a string and said it was acharm the devil give to him with his own hands and told him he couldcure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just bysaying something to it but he never told what it was he said to it niggers would come from all around there and give jim anything theyhad just for a sight of that fivecenter piece but they wouldnt touchit because the devil had had his hands on it  jim was most ruined fora servant because he got stuck up on account of having seen the deviland been rode by witcheswell when tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away downinto the village and could see three or four lights twinkling wherethere was sick folks maybe and the stars over us was sparkling everso fine and down by the village was the river a whole mile broad andawful still and grand  we went down the hill and found jo harper andben rogers and two or three more of the boys hid in the old tanyard so we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a halfto the big scar on the hillside and went ashorewe went to a clump of bushes and tom made everybody swear to keep thesecret and then showed them a hole in the hill right in the thickestpart of the bushes  then we lit the candles and crawled in on ourhands and knees  we went about two hundred yards and then the caveopened up tom poked about amongst the passages and pretty soon duckedunder a wall where you wouldnt a noticed that there was a hole  wewent along a narrow place and got into a kind of room all damp andsweaty and cold and there we stopped  tom saysnow well start this band of robbers and call it tom sawyers gangeverybody that wants to join has got to take an oath and write his namein bloodeverybody was willing  so tom got out a sheet of paper that he hadwrote the oath on and read it  it swore every boy to stick to theband and never tell any of the secrets and if anybody done anything toany boy in the band whichever boy was ordered to kill that person andhis family must do it and he mustnt eat and he mustnt sleep till hehad killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts which was the signof the band and nobody that didnt belong to the band could use thatmark and if he did he must be sued and if he done it again he must bekilled  and if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets hemust have his throat cut and then have his carcass burnt up and theashes scattered all around and his name blotted off of the list withblood and never mentioned again by the gang but have a curse put on itand be forgot forevereverybody said it was a real beautiful oath and asked tom if he gotit out of his own head  he said some of it but the rest was out ofpiratebooks and robberbooks and every gang that was hightoned haditsome thought it would be good to kill the families of boys that toldthe secrets  tom said it was a good idea so he took a pencil and wroteit in then ben rogers saysheres huck finn he haint got no family what you going to do bouthimwell haint he got a father says tom sawyeryes hes got a father but you cant never find him these days  heused to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard but he haint been seenin these parts for a year or morethey talked it over and they was going to rule me out because theysaid every boy must have a family or somebody to kill or else itwouldnt be fair and square for the others  well nobody could think ofanything to doeverybody was stumped and set still  i was most readyto cry but all at once i thought of a way and so i offered them misswatsonthey could kill her  everybody saidoh shell do  thats all right  huck can come inthen they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign withand i made my mark on the papernow says ben rogers whats the line of business of this gangnothing only robbery and murder tom saidbut who are we going to robhouses or cattle orstuff stealing cattle and such things aint robbery its burglary says tom sawyer  we aint burglars  that aint no sort of style  weare highwaymen  we stop stages and carriages on the road with maskson and kill the people and take their watches and moneymust we always kill the peopleoh certainly  its best  some authorities think different butmostly its considered best to kill themexcept some that you bring tothe cave here and keep them till theyre ransomedransomed  whats thati dont know  but thats what they do  ive seen it in books and soof course thats what weve got to dobut how can we do it if we dont know what it iswhy blame it all weve got to do it  dont i tell you its in thebooks  do you want to go to doing different from whats in the booksand get things all muddled upoh thats all very fine to say tom sawyer but how in the nationare these fellows going to be ransomed if we dont know how to do itto themthats the thing i want to get at  now what do you reckon itiswell i dont know  but peraps if we keep them till theyre ransomedit means that we keep them till theyre deadnow thats something like  thatll answer  why couldnt you saidthat before  well keep them till theyre ransomed to death and abothersome lot theyll be tooeating up everything and always tryingto get loosehow you talk ben rogers  how can they get loose when theres a guardover them ready to shoot them down if they move a pega guard  well that is good  so somebodys got to set up all nightand never get any sleep just so as to watch them  i think thatsfoolishness why cant a body take a club and ransom them as soon asthey get herebecause it aint in the books sothats why  now ben rogers do youwant to do things regular or dont youthats the idea  dont youreckon that the people that made the books knows whats the correctthing to do  do you reckon you can learn em anything  not by a gooddeal no sir well just go on and ransom them in the regular wayall right  i dont mind but i say its a fool way anyhow  say dowe kill the women toowell ben rogers if i was as ignorant as you i wouldnt let on  killthe women  no nobody ever saw anything in the books like that  youfetch them to the cave and youre always as polite as pie to themand by and by they fall in love with you and never want to go home anymorewell if thats the way im agreed but i dont take no stock in itmighty soon well have the cave so cluttered up with women and fellowswaiting to be ransomed that there wont be no place for the robbersbut go ahead i aint got nothing to saylittle tommy barnes was asleep now and when they waked him up he wasscared and cried and said he wanted to go home to his ma and didntwant to be a robber any moreso they all made fun of him and called him crybaby and that made himmad and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets  buttom give him five cents to keep quiet and said we would all go home andmeet next week and rob somebody and kill some peopleben rogers said he couldnt get out much only sundays and so he wantedto begin next sunday but all the boys said it would be wicked to do iton sunday and that settled the thing  they agreed to get together andfix a day as soon as they could and then we elected tom sawyer firstcaptain and jo harper second captain of the gang and so started homei clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day wasbreaking my new clothes was all greased up and clayey and i wasdogtiredwell i got a good goingover in the morning from old miss watson onaccount of my clothes but the widow she didnt scold but only cleanedoff the grease and clay and looked so sorry that i thought i wouldbehave awhile if i could  then miss watson she took me in the closetand prayed but nothing come of it  she told me to pray every day andwhatever i asked for i would get it  but it warnt so  i tried itonce i got a fishline but no hooks  it warnt any good to me withouthooks  i tried for the hooks three or four times but somehow icouldnt make it work  by and by one day i asked miss watson totry for me but she said i was a fool  she never told me why and icouldnt make it out no wayi set down one time back in the woods and had a long think about it i says to myself if a body can get anything they pray for why dontdeacon winn get back the money he lost on pork  why cant the widow getback her silver snuffbox that was stole  why cant miss watson fat upno says i to my self there aint nothing in it  i went and told thewidow about it and she said the thing a body could get by praying forit was spiritual gifts  this was too many for me but she told mewhat she meanti must help other people and do everything i could forother people and look out for them all the time and never think aboutmyself this was including miss watson as i took it  i went out in thewoods and turned it over in my mind a long time but i couldnt see noadvantage about itexcept for the other people so at last i reckonedi wouldnt worry about it any more but just let it go  sometimes thewidow would take me one side and talk about providence in a way to makea bodys mouth water but maybe next day miss watson would take holdand knock it all down again  i judged i could see that there was twoprovidences and a poor chap would stand considerable show with thewidows providence but if miss watsons got him there warnt no helpfor him any more  i thought it all out and reckoned i would belongto the widows if he wanted me though i couldnt make out how he wasagoing to be any better off then than what he was before seeing i wasso ignorant and so kind of lowdown and ornerypap he hadnt been seen for more than a year and that was comfortablefor me i didnt want to see him no more  he used to always whale mewhen he was sober and could get his hands on me though i used to taketo the woods most of the time when he was around  well about this timehe was found in the river drownded about twelve mile above town sopeople said  they judged it was him anyway said this drownded man wasjust his size and was ragged and had uncommon long hair which was alllike pap but they couldnt make nothing out of the face because it hadbeen in the water so long it warnt much like a face at all  they saidhe was floating on his back in the water  they took him and buried himon the bank  but i warnt comfortable long because i happened to thinkof something  i knowed mighty well that a drownded man dont float onhis back but on his face  so i knowed then that this warnt pap buta woman dressed up in a mans clothes  so i was uncomfortable again i judged the old man would turn up again by and by though i wished hewouldntwe played robber now and then about a month and then i resigned  allthe boys did  we hadnt robbed nobody hadnt killed any people butonly just pretended  we used to hop out of the woods and go chargingdown on hogdrivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to marketbut we never hived any of them  tom sawyer called the hogs ingots and he called the turnips and stuff julery and we would go to thecave and powwow over what we had done and how many people we had killedand marked  but i couldnt see no profit in it  one time tom sent aboy to run about town with a blazing stick which he called a sloganwhich was the sign for the gang to get together and then he said hehad got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of spanishmerchants and rich arabs was going to camp in cave hollow with twohundred elephants and six hundred camels and over a thousand sumter mules all loaded down with dimonds and they didnt have only a guardof four hundred soldiers and so we would lay in ambuscade as he calledit and kill the lot and scoop the things  he said we must slick upour swords and guns and get ready  he never could go after even aturnipcart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for itthough they was only lath and broomsticks and you might scour at themtill you rotted and then they warnt worth a mouthful of ashes morethan what they was before  i didnt believe we could lick such a crowdof spaniards and arabs but i wanted to see the camels and elephantsso i was on hand next day saturday in the ambuscade and when we gotthe word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill  but there warntno spaniards and arabs and there warnt no camels nor no elephants it warnt anything but a sundayschool picnic and only a primerclassat that  we busted it up and chased the children up the hollow but wenever got anything but some doughnuts and jam though ben rogers gota rag doll and jo harper got a hymnbook and a tract and then theteacher charged in and made us drop everything and cut i didnt see no dimonds and i told tom sawyer so  he said there wasloads of them there anyway and he said there was arabs there tooand elephants and things  i said why couldnt we see them then  hesaid if i warnt so ignorant but had read a book called don quixote iwould know without asking  he said it was all done by enchantment  hesaid there was hundreds of soldiers there and elephants and treasureand so on but we had enemies which he called magicians and they hadturned the whole thing into an infant sundayschool just out of spite i said all right then the thing for us to do was to go for themagicians  tom sawyer said i was a numskullwhy said he a magician could call up a lot of genies and theywould hash you up like nothing before you could say jack robinson  theyare as tall as a tree and as big around as a churchwell i says spose we got some genies to help uscant we lickthe other crowd thenhow you going to get themi dont know  how do they get themwhy they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring and then the geniescome tearing in with the thunder and lightning aripping around and thesmoke arolling and everything theyre told to do they up and do it they dont think nothing of pulling a shottower up by the roots andbelting a sundayschool superintendent over the head with itor anyother manwho makes them tear around sowhy whoever rubs the lamp or the ring  they belong to whoever rubsthe lamp or the ring and theyve got to do whatever he says  if hetells them to build a palace forty miles long out of dimonds and fillit full of chewinggum or whatever you want and fetch an emperorsdaughter from china for you to marry theyve got to do itand theyvegot to do it before sunup next morning too  and more  theyve gotto waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it youunderstandwell says i i think they are a pack of flatheads for not keepingthe palace themselves stead of fooling them away like that  and whatsmoreif i was one of them i would see a man in jericho before i woulddrop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamphow you talk huck finn  why youd have to come when he rubbed itwhether you wanted to or notwhat and i as high as a tree and as big as a church  all right theni would come but i lay id make that man climb the highest tree therewas in the countryshucks it aint no use to talk to you huck finn  you dont seem toknow anything somehowperfect sapheadi thought all this over for two or three days and then i reckoned iwould see if there was anything in it  i got an old tin lamp and aniron ring and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till i sweatlike an injun calculating to build a palace and sell it but it warntno use none of the genies come  so then i judged that all that stuffwas only just one of tom sawyers lies  i reckoned he believed in thearabs and the elephants but as for me i think different  it had allthe marks of a sundayschoolwell three or four months run along and it was well into the winternow i had been to school most all the time and could spell and read andwrite just a little and could say the multiplication table up to sixtimes seven is thirtyfive and i dont reckon i could ever get anyfurther than that if i was to live forever  i dont take no stock inmathematics anywayat first i hated the school but by and by i got so i could stand itwhenever i got uncommon tired i played hookey and the hiding i got nextday done me good and cheered me up  so the longer i went to school theeasier it got to be  i was getting sort of used to the widows waystoo and they warnt so raspy on me  living in a house and sleeping ina bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly but before the cold weather iused to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes and so that was arest to me  i liked the old ways best but i was getting so i liked thenew ones too a little bit the widow said i was coming along slow butsure and doing very satisfactory  she said she warnt ashamed of meone morning i happened to turn over the saltcellar at breakfast i reached for some of it as quick as i could to throw over my leftshoulder and keep off the bad luck but miss watson was in ahead of meand crossed me off she says take your hands away huckleberry whata mess you are always making  the widow put in a good word for me butthat warnt going to keep off the bad luck i knowed that well enough i started out after breakfast feeling worried and shaky andwondering where it was going to fall on me and what it was going to be there is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck but this wasnt oneof them kind so i never tried to do anything but just poked alonglowspirited and on the watchouti went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you gothrough the high board fence  there was an inch of new snow on theground and i seen somebodys tracks  they had come up from the quarryand stood around the stile a while and then went on around the gardenfence  it was funny they hadnt come in after standing around so  icouldnt make it out  it was very curious somehow  i was going tofollow around but i stooped down to look at the tracks first  i didntnotice anything at first but next i did  there was a cross in the leftbootheel made with big nails to keep off the devili was up in a second and shinning down the hill  i looked over myshoulder every now and then but i didnt see nobody  i was at judgethatchers as quick as i could get there  he saidwhy my boy you are all out of breath  did you come for yourinterestno sir i says is there some for meoh yes a halfyearly is in last nightover a hundred and fiftydollars  quite a fortune for you  you had better let me invest italong with your six thousand because if you take it youll spend itno sir i says i dont want to spend it  i dont want it atallnor the six thousand nuther  i want you to take it i want to giveit to youthe six thousand and allhe looked surprised  he couldnt seem to make it out  he sayswhy what can you mean my boyi says dont you ask me no questions about it please  youll takeitwont youhe sayswell im puzzled  is something the matterplease take it says i and dont ask me nothingthen i wont have totell no lieshe studied a while and then he saysohoo  i think i see  you want to sell all your property to menotgive it  thats the correct ideathen he wrote something on a paper and read it over and saysthere you see it says for a consideration  that means i have boughtit of you and paid you for it  heres a dollar for you  now you signitso i signed it and leftmiss watsons nigger jim had a hairball as big as your fist whichhad been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox and he used to domagic with it  he said there was a spirit inside of it and it knowedeverything  so i went to him that night and told him pap was hereagain for i found his tracks in the snow  what i wanted to know waswhat he was going to do and was he going to stay  jim got out hishairball and said something over it and then he held it up and droppedit on the floor  it fell pretty solid and only rolled about an inch jim tried it again and then another time and it acted just the same jim got down on his knees and put his ear against it and listened but it warnt no use he said it wouldnt talk he said sometimes itwouldnt talk without money  i told him i had an old slick counterfeitquarter that warnt no good because the brass showed through the silvera little and it wouldnt pass nohow even if the brass didnt showbecause it was so slick it felt greasy and so that would tell on itevery time  i reckoned i wouldnt say nothing about the dollar i gotfrom the judge i said it was pretty bad money but maybe the hairballwould take it because maybe it wouldnt know the difference  jim smeltit and bit it and rubbed it and said he would manage so the hairballwould think it was good  he said he would split open a raw irish potatoand stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night and nextmorning you couldnt see no brass and it wouldnt feel greasy no moreand so anybody in town would take it in a minute let alone a hairball well i knowed a potato would do that before but i had forgot itjim put the quarter under the hairball and got down and listenedagain this time he said the hairball was all right  he said itwould tell my whole fortune if i wanted it to  i says go on  so thehairball talked to jim and jim told it to me  he saysyo ole father doan know yit what hes agwyne to do  sometimes hespec hell go way en den agin he spec hell stay  de bes way

was drunk and he went to judge thatchers and bullyraggedhim and tried to make him give up the money but he couldnt and thenhe swore hed make the law force himthe judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me awayfrom him and let one of them be my guardian but it was a new judge thathad just come and he didnt know the old man so he said courts mustntinterfere and separate families if they could help it said hed druthernot take a child away from its father  so judge thatcher and the widowhad to quit on the businessthat pleased the old man till he couldnt rest  he said hed cowhideme till i was black and blue if i didnt raise some money for him  iborrowed three dollars from judge thatcher and pap took it and gotdrunk and went ablowing around and cussing and whooping and carryingon and he kept it up all over town with a tin pan till most midnightthen they jailed him and next day they had him before court and jailedhim again for a week  but he said he was satisfied said he was bossof his son and hed make it warm for himwhen he got out the new judge said he was agoing to make a man of himso he took him to his own house and dressed him up clean and nice andhad him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family and was justold pie to him so to speak  and after supper he talked to him abouttemperance and such things till the old man cried and said hed beena fool and fooled away his life but now he was agoing to turn overa new leaf and be a man nobody wouldnt be ashamed of and he hoped thejudge would help him and not look down on him  the judge said he couldhug him for them words so he cried and his wife she cried again papsaid hed been a man that had always been misunderstood before and thejudge said he believed it  the old man said that what a man wantedthat was down was sympathy and the judge said it was so so they criedagain  and when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out hishand and sayslook at it gentlemen and ladies all take ahold of it shake ittheres a hand that was the hand of a hog but it aint so no more itsthe hand of a man thats started in on a new life andll die beforehell go back  you mark them wordsdont forget i said them  its aclean hand now shake itdont be afeardso they shook it one after the other all around and cried  thejudges wife she kissed it  then the old man he signed a pledgemadehis mark the judge said it was the holiest time on record or somethinglike that then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room which wasthe spare room and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty andclumb out on to the porchroof and slid down a stanchion and traded hisnew coat for a jug of fortyrod and clumb back again and had a good oldtime and towards daylight he crawled out again drunk as a fiddler androlled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places and was mostfroze to death when somebody found him after sunup  and when they cometo look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they couldnavigate itthe judge he felt kind of sore  he said he reckoned a body could reformthe old man with a shotgun maybe but he didnt know no other waywell pretty soon the old man was up and around again and then he wentfor judge thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money and hewent for me too for not stopping school  he catched me a couple oftimes and thrashed me but i went to school just the same and dodgedhim or outrun him most of the time  i didnt want to go to school muchbefore but i reckoned id go now to spite pap  that law trial was aslow businessappeared like they warnt ever going to get started on itso every now and then id borrow two or three dollars off of the judgefor him to keep from getting a cowhiding  every time he got money hegot drunk and every time he got drunk he raised cain around town andevery time he raised cain he got jailed  he was just suitedthis kindof thing was right in his linehe got to hanging around the widows too much and so she told him atlast that if he didnt quit using around there she would make troublefor him well wasnt he mad  he said he would show who was huckfinns boss  so he watched out for me one day in the spring andcatched me and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff andcrossed over to the illinois shore where it was woody and there warntno houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thickyou couldnt find it if you didnt know where it washe kept me with him all the time and i never got a chance to run offwe lived in that old cabin and he always locked the door and put thekey under his head nights  he had a gun which he had stole i reckonand we fished and hunted and that was what we lived on  every littlewhile he locked me in and went down to the store three miles to theferry and traded fish and game for whisky and fetched it home and gotdrunk and had a good time and licked me  the widow she found out wherei was by and by and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me butpap drove him off with the gun and it warnt long after that till i wasused to being where i was and liked itall but the cowhide partit was kind of lazy and jolly laying off comfortable all day smokingand fishing and no books nor study  two months or more run along andmy clothes got to be all rags and dirt and i didnt see how id evergot to like it so well at the widows where you had to wash and eat ona plate and comb up and go to bed and get up regular and be foreverbothering over a book and have old miss watson pecking at you all thetime  i didnt want to go back no more  i had stopped cussing becausethe widow didnt like it but now i took to it again because pap hadntno objections  it was pretty good times up in the woods there take itall aroundbut by and by pap got too handy with his hickry and i couldnt standit i was all over welts  he got to going away so much too andlocking me in  once he locked me in and was gone three days  it wasdreadful lonesome  i judged he had got drownded and i wasnt evergoing to get out any more  i was scared  i made up my mind i would fixup some way to leave there  i had tried to get out of that cabin manya time but i couldnt find no way  there warnt a window to it bigenough for a dog to get through  i couldnt get up the chimbly itwas too narrow  the door was thick solid oak slabs  pap was prettycareful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was awayi reckon i had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times well iwas most all the time at it because it was about the only way to put inthe time  but this time i found something at last i found an old rustywoodsaw without any handle it was laid in between a rafter and theclapboards of the roof i greased it up and went to work  there was anold horseblanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabinbehind the table to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks andputting the candle out  i got under the table and raised the blanketand went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log outbig enoughto let me through  well it was a good long job but i was gettingtowards the end of it when i heard paps gun in the woods  i got rid ofthe signs of my work and dropped the blanket and hid my saw and prettysoon pap come inpap warnt in a good humorso he was his natural self  he said he wasdown town and everything was going wrong  his lawyer said he reckonedhe would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started onthe trial but then there was ways to put it off a long time and judgethatcher knowed how to do it and he said people allowed thered beanother trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for myguardian and they guessed it would win this time  this shook me upconsiderable because i didnt want to go back to the widows any moreand be so cramped up and sivilized as they called it  then the old mangot to cussing and cussed everything and everybody he could think ofand then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadnt skipped anyand after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all roundincluding a considerable parcel of people which he didnt know the namesof and so called them whatshisname when he got to them and wentright along with his cussinghe said he would like to see the widow get me  he said he would watchout and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a placesix or seven mile off to stow me in where they might hunt till theydropped and they couldnt find me  that made me pretty uneasy againbut only for a minute i reckoned i wouldnt stay on hand till he gotthat chancethe old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he hadgot there was a fiftypound sack of corn meal and a side of baconammunition and a fourgallon jug of whisky and an old book and twonewspapers for wadding besides some tow  i toted up a load and wentback and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest  i thought it allover and i reckoned i would walk off with the gun and some lines andtake to the woods when i run away  i guessed i wouldnt stay in oneplace but just tramp right across the country mostly night times andhunt and fish to keep alive and so get so far away that the old man northe widow couldnt ever find me any more  i judged i would saw out andleave that night if pap got drunk enough and i reckoned he would  igot so full of it i didnt notice how long i was staying till the oldman hollered and asked me whether i was asleep or drowndedi got the things all up to the cabin and then it was about dark  whilei was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort ofwarmed up and went to ripping again  he had been drunk over in townand laid in the gutter all night and he was a sight to look at  a bodywould a thought he was adamhe was just all mud  whenever his liquorbegun to work he most always went for the govment this time he sayscall this a govment why just look at it and see what its likeheres the law astanding ready to take a mans son away from himamans own son which he has had all the trouble and all the anxietyand all the expense of raising  yes just as that man has got thatson raised at last and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin forhim and give him a rest the law up and goes for him  and they callthat govment  that aint all nuther  the law backs that old judgethatcher up and helps him to keep me out o my property  heres whatthe law does  the law takes a man worth six thousand dollars andupards and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this and letshim go round in clothes that aint fitten for a hog they call thatgovment  a man cant get his rights in a govment like this sometimesive a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all yesand i told em so i told old thatcher so to his face  lots of emheard me and can tell what i said  says i for two cents id leave theblamed country and never come anear it agin  thems the very words  isays look at my hatif you call it a hatbut the lid raises up and therest of it goes down till its below my chin and then it aint rightlya hat at all but more like my head was shoved up through a jint ostovepipe  look at it says isuch a hat for me to wearone of thewealthiest men in this town if i could git my rightsoh yes this is a wonderful govment wonderful  why looky herethere was a free nigger there from ohioa mulatter most as white asa white man  he had the whitest shirt on you ever see too and theshiniest hat and there aint a man in that town thats got as fineclothes as what he had and he had a gold watch and chain and asilverheaded canethe awfulest old grayheaded nabob in the state  andwhat do you think  they said he was a pfessor in a college and couldtalk all kinds of languages and knowed everything  and that aint thewust they said he could vote when he was at home  well that let meout thinks i what is the country acoming to  it was lection dayand i was just about to go and vote myself if i warnt too drunk to getthere but when they told me there was a state in this country wheretheyd let that nigger vote i drawed out  i says ill never vote agin thems the very words i said they all heard me and the country mayrot for all meill never vote agin as long as i live  and to see thecool way of that niggerwhy he wouldnt a give me the road if i hadntshoved him out o the way  i says to the people why aint this niggerput up at auction and soldthats what i want to know  and what do youreckon they said why they said he couldnt be sold till hed been inthe state six months and he hadnt been there that long yet  therenowthats a specimen  they call that a govment that cant sell a freenigger till hes been in the state six months  heres a govment thatcalls itself a govment and lets on to be a govment and thinks it is agovment and yets got to set stockstill for six whole months beforeit can take a hold of a prowling thieving infernal whiteshirted freenigger andpap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs wastaking him to so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork andbarked both shins and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kindof languagemostly hove at the nigger and the govment though he givethe tub some too all along here and there  he hopped around thecabin considerable first on one leg and then on the other holdingfirst one shin and then the other one and at last he let out with hisleft foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick  but itwarnt good judgment because that was the boot that had a couple of histoes leaking out of the front end of it so now he raised a howl thatfairly made a bodys hair raise and down he went in the dirt androlled there and held his toes and the cussing he done then laid overanything he had ever done previous  he said so his own self afterwards he had heard old sowberry hagan in his best days and he said it laidover him too but i reckon that was sort of piling it on maybeafter supper pap took the jug and said he had enough whisky therefor two drunks and one delirium tremens  that was always his word  ijudged he would be blind drunk in about an hour and then i would stealthe key or saw myself out one or tother  he drank and drank andtumbled down on his blankets by and by but luck didnt run my way he didnt go sound asleep but was uneasy  he groaned and moaned andthrashed around this way and that for a long time  at last i got sosleepy i couldnt keep my eyes open all i could do and so before iknowed what i was about i was sound asleep and the candle burningi dont know how long i was asleep but all of a sudden there was anawful scream and i was up  there was pap looking wild and skippingaround every which way and yelling about snakes  he said they wascrawling up his legs and then he would give a jump and scream and sayone had bit him on the cheekbut i couldnt see no snakes  he startedand run round and round the cabin hollering take him off take himoff hes biting me on the neck  i never see a man
