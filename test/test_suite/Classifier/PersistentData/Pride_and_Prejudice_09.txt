are several of the young men too that shelikes very much the officers may not be so pleasant in general sregimenthis daughters request for such it might be considered of beingadmitted into her family again before she set off for the northreceived at first an absolute negative but jane and elizabethwho agreed in wishing for the sake of their sisters feelings andconsequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parentsurged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly to receive herand her husband at longbourn as soon as they were married that he wasprevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished and theirmother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to showher married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to thenorth when mr bennet wrote again to his brother therefore he senthis permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon asthe ceremony was over they should proceed to longbourn elizabeth wassurprised however that wickham should consent to such a scheme andhad she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him wouldhave been the last object of her wishestheir sisters wedding day arrived and jane and elizabeth felt for herprobably more than she felt for herself the carriage was sent tomeet them at  and they were to return in it by dinnertime theirarrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets and jane more especiallywho gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had shebeen the culprit and was wretched in the thought of what her sistermust endurethey came the family were assembled in the breakfast room to receivethem smiles decked the face of mrs bennet as the carriage drove up tothe door her husband looked impenetrably grave her daughters alarmedanxious uneasylydias voice was heard in the vestibule the door was thrown open andshe ran into the room her mother stepped forwards embraced her andwelcomed her with rapture gave her hand with an affectionate smileto wickham who followed his lady and wished them both joy with analacrity which shewed no doubt of their happinesstheir reception from mr bennet to whom they then turned was not quiteso cordial his countenance rather gained in austerity and he scarcelyopened his lips the easy assurance of the young couple indeed wasenough to provoke him elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennetwas shocked lydia was lydia still untamed unabashed wild noisyand fearless she turned from sister to sister demanding theircongratulations and when at length they all sat down looked eagerlyround the room took notice of some little alteration in it andobserved with a laugh that it was a great while since she had beentherewickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his mannerswere always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage beenexactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while heclaimed their relationship would have delighted them all elizabeth hadnot before believed him quite equal to such assurance but she sat downresolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudenceof an impudent man she blushed and jane blushed but the cheeks of thetwo who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colourthere was no want of discourse the bride and her mother could neitherof them talk fast enough and wickham who happened to sit nearelizabeth began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhoodwith a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in herreplies they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in theworld nothing of the past was recollected with pain and lydia ledvoluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to forthe worldonly think of its being three months she cried since i went awayit seems but a fortnight i declare and yet there have been thingsenough happened in the time good gracious when i went away i am surei had no more idea of being married till i came back again though ithought it would be very good fun if i washer father lifted up his eyes jane was distressed elizabeth lookedexpressively at lydia but she who never heard nor saw anything ofwhich she chose to be insensible gaily continued oh mamma do thepeople hereabouts know i am married today i was afraid they might notand we overtook william goulding in his curricle so i was determined heshould know it and so i let down the sideglass next to him and tookoff my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame so thathe might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like anythingelizabeth could bear it no longer she got up and ran out of the roomand returned no more till she heard them passing through the hall tothe dining parlour she then joined them soon enough to see lydia withanxious parade walk up to her mothers right hand and hear her sayto her eldest sister ah jane i take your place now and you must golower because i am a married womanit was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassmentfrom which she had been so wholly free at first her ease and goodspirits increased she longed to see mrs phillips the lucases andall their other neighbours and to hear herself called mrs wickham by each of them and in the mean time she went after dinner to show herring and boast of being married to mrs hill and the two housemaidswell mamma said she when they were all returned to the breakfastroom and what do you think of my husband is not he a charming man iam sure my sisters must all envy me i only hope they may have halfmy good luck they must all go to brighton that is the place to gethusbands what a pity it is mamma we did not all govery true and if i had my will we should but my dear lydia i dontat all like your going such a way off must it be sooh lord yesthere is nothing in that i shall like it of allthings you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us weshall be at newcastle all the winter and i dare say there will be someballs and i will take care to get good partners for them alli should like it beyond anything said her motherand then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sistersbehind you and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before thewinter is overi thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth but i do notparticularly like your way of getting husbandstheir visitors were not to remain above ten days with them mr wickhamhad received his commission before he left london and he was to joinhis regiment at the end of a fortnightno one but mrs bennet regretted that their stay would be so short andshe made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter andhaving very frequent parties at home these parties were acceptable toall to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as didthink than such as did notwickhams affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expectedto find it not equal to lydias for him she had scarcely needed herpresent observation to be satisfied from the reason of things thattheir elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love ratherthan by his and she would have wondered why without violently caringfor her he chose to elope with her at all had she not felt certainthat his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances andif that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunityof having a companionlydia was exceedingly fond of him he was her dear wickham on everyoccasion no one was to be put in competition with him he did everything best in the world and she was sure he would kill more birds onthe first of september than any body else in the countryone morning soon after their arrival as she was sitting with her twoelder sisters she said to elizabethlizzy i never gave you an account of my wedding i believe youwere not by when i told mamma and the others all about it are not youcurious to hear how it was managedno really replied elizabeth i think there cannot be too little saidon the subjectla you are so strange but i must tell you how it went off we weremarried you know at st clements because wickhams lodgings were inthat parish and it was settled that we should all be there by elevenoclock my uncle and aunt and i were to go together and the otherswere to meet us at the church well monday morning came and i was insuch a fuss i was so afraid you know that something would happen toput it off and then i should have gone quite distracted and there wasmy aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just asif she was reading a sermon however i did not hear above one word inten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham i longedto know whether he would be married in his blue coatwell and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would neverbe over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and auntwere horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them if youll believeme i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there afortnight not one party or scheme or anything to be sure london wasrather thin but however the little theatre was open well and sojust as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away uponbusiness to that horrid man mr stone and then you know when oncethey get together there is no end of it well i was so frightened idid not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away and if wewere beyond the hour we could not be married all day but luckily hecame back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out howeveri recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going thewedding need not be put off for mr darcy might have done as wellmr darcy repeated elizabeth in utter amazementoh yeshe was to come there with wickham you know but graciousme i quite forgot i ought not to have said a word about it i promisedthem so faithfully what will wickham say it was to be such a secretif it was to be secret said jane say not another word on thesubject you may depend upon my seeking no furtheroh certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity we willask you no questionsthank you said lydia for if you did i should certainly tell youall and then wickham would be angryon such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of herpower by running awaybut to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at leastit was impossible not to try for information mr darcy had been ather sisters wedding it was exactly a scene and exactly among peoplewhere he had apparently least to do and least temptation to goconjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into herbrain but she was satisfied with none those that best pleased her asplacing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable shecould not bear such suspense and hastily seizing a sheet of paperwrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of whatlydia had dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had beenintendedyou may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must beto know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparativelyspeaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at sucha time pray write instantly and let me understand itunless it isfor very cogent reasons to remain in the secrecy which lydia seemsto think necessary and then i must endeavour to be satisfied withignorancenot that i shall though she added to herself as she finishedthe letter and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourablemanner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find itoutjanes delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak toelizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall elizabeth was gladof ittill it appeared whether her inquiries would receive anysatisfaction she had rather be without a confidanteelizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter assoon as she possibly could she was no sooner in possession of itthan hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely tobe interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared tobe happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did notcontain a denialgracechurch street sept my dear niecei have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morningto answering it as i foresee that a little writing will not comprisewhat i have to tell you i must confess myself surprised by yourapplication i did not expect it from you dont think me angryhowever for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined suchinquiries to be necessary on your side if you do not choose tounderstand me forgive my impertinence your uncle is as much surprisedas i amand nothing but the belief of your being a party concernedwould have allowed him to act as he has done but if you are reallyinnocent and ignorant i must be more expliciton the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a mostunexpected visitor mr darcy called and was shut up with him severalhours it was all over before i arrived so my curiosity was not sodreadfully racked as yours seems to have been he came to tell mrgardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr wickham wereand that he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedlylydia once from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one dayafter ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting forthem the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing tohimself that wickhams worthlessness had not been so well known as tomake it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confidein him he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride andconfessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his privateactions open to the world his character was to speak for itself hecalled it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedyan evil which had been brought on by himself if he had anothermotive i am sure it would never disgrace him he had been some daysin town before he was able to discover them but he had something todirect his search which was more than we had and the consciousnessof this was another reason for his resolving to follow usthere is a lady it seems a mrs younge who was some time agogoverness to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some causeof disapprobation though he did not say what she then took a largehouse in edwardstreet and has since maintained herself by lettinglodgings this mrs younge was he knew intimately acquainted withwickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got totown but it was two or three days before he could get from her what hewanted she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery andcorruption for she really did know where her friend was to be foundwickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and hadshe been able to receive them into her house they would have taken uptheir abode with her at length however our kind friend procured thewishedfor direction they were in  street he saw wickham andafterwards insisted on seeing lydia his first object with her heacknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgracefulsituation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailedon to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go buthe found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was she caredfor none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hearof leaving wickham she was sure they should be married some time orother and it did not much signify when since such were her feelingsit only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage whichin his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had neverbeen his design he confessed himself obliged to leave the regimenton account of some debts of honour which were very pressing andscrupled not to lay all the illconsequences of lydias flight on herown folly alone he meant to resign his commission immediately and asto his future situation he could conjecture very little about it hemust go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should havenothing to live onmr darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once thoughmr bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been ableto do something for him and his situation must have been benefited bymarriage but he found in reply to this question that wickham stillcherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage insome other country under such circumstances however he was not likelyto be proof against the temptation of immediate reliefthey met several times for there was much to be discussed wickham ofcourse wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to bereasonableevery thing being settled between them mr darcys next step was tomake your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurchstreet the evening before i came home but mr gardiner could not beseen and mr darcy found on further inquiry that your father wasstill with him but would quit town the next morning he did not judgeyour father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as youruncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after thedeparture of the former he did not leave his name and till the nextday it was only known that a gentleman had called on businesson saturday he came again your father was gone your uncle at homeand as i said before they had a great deal of talk togetherthey met again on sunday and then i saw him too it was not allsettled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off tolongbourn but our visitor was very obstinate i fancy lizzy thatobstinacy is the real defect of his character after all he has beenaccused of many faults at different times but this is the true onenothing was to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure andi do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it youruncle would most readily have settled the wholethey battled it together for a long time which was more than eitherthe gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved but at last your unclewas forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to hisniece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of itwhich went sorely against the grain and i really believe your letterthis morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanationthat would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise whereit was due but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or janeat mostyou know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the youngpeople his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerablymore than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her ownsettled upon her and his commission purchased the reason why allthis was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above itwas owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration thatwickhams character had been so misunderstood and consequently that hehad been received and noticed as he was perhaps there was some truthin this though i doubt whether his reserve or anybodys reservecan be answerable for the event but in spite of all this fine talkingmy dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle wouldnever have yielded if we had not given him credit for anotherinterest in the affairwhen all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends whowere still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be inlondon once more when the wedding took place and all money matters werethen to receive the last finishi believe i have now told you every thing it is a relation whichyou tell me is to give you great surprise i hope at least it will notafford you any displeasure lydia came to us and wickham had constantadmission to the house he was exactly what he had been when iknew him in hertfordshire but i would not tell you how little i wassatisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us if i had notperceived by janes letter last wednesday that her conduct on cominghome was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tellyou can give you no fresh pain i talked to her repeatedly in the mostserious manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she haddone and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family if sheheard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen i wassometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth andjane and for their sakes had patience with hermr darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed youattended the wedding he dined with us the next day and was to leavetown again on wednesday or thursday will you be very angry with me mydear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never boldenough to say before how much i like him his behaviour to us hasin every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire hisunderstanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but a littlemore liveliness and that if he marry prudently his wife may teachhim i thought him very slyhe hardly ever mentioned your name butslyness seems the fashionpray forgive me if i have been very presuming or at least do notpunish me so far as to exclude me from p i shall never be quite happytill i have been all round the park a low phaeton with a nice littlepair of ponies would be the very thingbut i must write no more the children have been wanting me this halfhouryours very sincerelym gardinerthe contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spiritsin which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore thegreatest share the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty hadproduced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sistersmatch which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness toogreat to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from thepain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be truehe had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself allthe trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in whichsupplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate anddespise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reasonwith persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished toavoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce he haddone all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem herheart did whisper that he had done it for her but it was a hope shortlychecked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her vanitywas insufficient when required to depend on his affection for herfora woman who had already refused himas able to overcome a sentiment sonatural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham brotherinlawof wickham every kind of pride must revolt from the connection he hadto be sure done much she was ashamed to think how much but he hadgiven a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinarystretch of belief it was reasonable that he should feel he had beenwrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it andthough she would not place herself as his principal inducement shecould perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assisthis endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materiallyconcerned it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they wereunder obligations to a person who could never receive a return theyowed the restoration of lydia her character every thing to him ohhow heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had everencouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him forherself she was humbled but she was proud of him proud that in a causeof compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himselfshe read over her aunts commendation of him again and again itwas hardly enough but it pleased her she was even sensible of somepleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both sheand her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsistedbetween mr darcy and herselfshe was roused from her seat and her reflections by some onesapproach and before she could strike into another path she wasovertaken by wickhami am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister said heas he joined heryou certainly do she replied with a smile but it does not followthat the interruption must be unwelcomei should be sorry indeed if it were we were always good friends andnow we are bettertrue are the others coming outi do not know mrs bennet and lydia are going in the carriage tomeryton and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and aunt thatyou have actually seen pemberleyshe replied in the affirmativei almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be too muchfor me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle and you saw theold housekeeper i suppose poor reynolds she was always very fond ofme but of course she did not mention my name to youyes she didand what did she saythat you were gone into the army and she was afraid hadnot turnedout well at such a distance as that you know things are strangelymisrepresentedcertainly he replied biting his lips elizabeth hoped she hadsilenced him but he soon afterwards saidi was surprised to see darcy in town last month we passed each otherseveral times i wonder what he can be doing thereperhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh saidelizabeth it must be something particular to take him there at thistime of yearundoubtedly did you see him while you were at lambton i thought iunderstood from the gardiners that you hadyes he introduced us to his sisterand do you like hervery muchi have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this yearor two when i last saw her she was not very promising i am very gladyou liked her i hope she will turn out welli dare say she will she has got over the most trying agedid you go by the village of kymptoni do not recollect that we didi mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had amost delightful placeexcellent parsonage house it would have suitedme in every respecthow should you have liked making sermonsexceedingly well i should have considered it as part of my dutyand the exertion would soon have been nothing one ought not torepinebut to be sure it would have been such a thing for me thequiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideasof happiness but it was not to be did you ever hear darcy mention thecircumstance when you were in kenti have heard from authority which i thought as good that it wasleft you conditionally only and at the will of the present patronyou have yes there was something in that i told you so from thefirst you may rememberi did hear too that there was a time when sermonmaking was notso palatable to you as it seems to be at present that you actuallydeclared your resolution of never taking orders and that the businesshad been compromised accordinglyyou did and it was not wholly without foundation you may rememberwhat i told you on that point when first we talked of itthey were now almost at the door of the house for she had walked fastto get rid of him and unwilling for her sisters sake to provoke himshe only said in reply with a goodhumoured smilecome mr wickham we are brother and sister you know do not letus quarrel about the past in future i hope we shall be always of onemindshe held out her hand he kissed it with affectionate gallantry thoughhe hardly knew how to look and they entered the housemr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that henever again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabethby introducing the subject of it and she was pleased to find that shehad said enough to keep him quietthe day of his and lydias departure soon came and mrs bennet wasforced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no meansentered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle was likely tocontinue at least a twelvemonthoh my dear lydia she cried when shall we meet againoh lord i dont know not these two or three years perhapswrite to me very often my dearas often as i can but you know married women have never much time forwriting my sisters may write to me they will have nothing else todomr wickhams adieus were much more affectionate than his wifes hesmiled looked handsome and said many pretty thingshe is as fine a fellow said mr bennet as soon as they were out ofthe house as ever i saw he simpers and smirks and makes love tous all i am prodigiously proud of him i defy even sir william lucashimself to produce a more valuable soninlawthe loss of her daughter made mrs bennet very dull for several daysi often think said she that there is nothing so bad as parting withones friends one seems so forlorn without themthis is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter saidelizabeth it must make you better satisfied that your other four aresingleit is no such thing lydia does not leave me because she is marriedbut only because her husbands regiment happens to be so far off ifthat had been nearer she would not have gone so soonbut the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortlyrelieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by anarticle of news which then began to be in circulation the housekeeperat netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of hermaster who was coming down in a day or two to shoot there for severalweeks mrs bennet was quite in the fidgets she looked at jane andsmiled and shook her head by turnswell well and so mr bingley is coming down sister for mrsphillips first brought her the news well so much the better notthat i care about it though he is nothing to us you know and i amsure i never want to see him again but however he is very welcometo come to netherfield if he likes it and who knows what may happenbut that is nothing to us you know sister we agreed long ago never tomention a word about it and so is it quite certain he is comingyou may depend on it replied the other for mrs nicholls was inmeryton last night i saw her passing by and went out myself on purposeto know the truth of it and she told me that it was certain true hecomes down on thursday at the latest very likely on wednesday she wasgoing to the butchers she told me on purpose to order in some meat onwednesday and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killedmiss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changingcolour it was many months since she had mentioned his name toelizabeth but now as soon as they were alone together she saidi saw you look at me today lizzy when my aunt told us of the presentreport and i know i appeared distressed but dont imagine it was fromany silly cause i was only confused for the moment because i felt thati should be looked at i do assure you that the news does not affectme either with pleasure or pain i am glad of one thing that he comesalone because we shall see the less of him not that i am afraid ofmyself but i dread other peoples remarkselizabeth did not know what to make of it had she not seen him inderbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with noother view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partialto jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his comingthere with his friends permission or being bold enough to comewithout ityet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannotcome to a house which he has legally hired without raising all thisspeculation i will leave him to himselfin spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be herfeelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easilyperceive that her spirits were affected by it they were more disturbedmore unequal than she had often seen themthe subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parentsabout a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward againas soon as ever mr bingley comes my dear said mrs bennet youwill wait on him of courseno no you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if iwent to see him he should marry one of my daughters but it ended innothing and i will not be sent on a fools errand againhis wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attentionwould be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his returning tonetherfieldtis an etiquette i despise said he if he wants our societylet him seek it he knows where we live i will not spend my hoursin running after my neighbours every time they go away and come backagainwell all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not waiton him but however that shant prevent my asking him to dine here iam determined we must have mrs long and the gouldings soon that willmake thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at table forhimconsoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear herhusbands incivility though it was very mortifying to know that herneighbours might all see mr bingley in consequence of it beforethey did as the day of his arrival drew neari begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister itwould be nothing i could see him with perfect indifference but i canhardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of my mother means wellbut she does not know no one can know how much i suffer from what shesays happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is overi wish i could say anything to comfort you replied elizabeth but itis wholly out of my power you must feel it and the usual satisfactionof preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me because you havealways so muchmr bingley arrived mrs bennet through the assistance of servantscontrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxietyand fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could she countedthe days that must intervene before their invitation could be senthopeless of seeing him before but on the third morning after hisarrival in hertfordshire she saw him from her dressingroom windowenter the paddock and ride towards the househer daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy jane resolutelykept her place at the table but elizabeth to satisfy her mother wentto the windowshe lookedshe saw mr darcy with him and sat downagain by her sisterthere is a gentleman with him mamma said kitty who can it besome acquaintance or other my dear i suppose i am sure i do notknowla replied kitty it looks just like that man that used to be withhim before mr whatshisname that tall proud mangood gracious mr darcyand so it does i vow well any friend ofmr bingleys will always be welcome here to be sure but else i mustsay that i hate the very sight of himjane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern she knew but littleof their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardnesswhich must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first timeafter receiving his explanatory letter both sisters were uncomfortableenough each felt for the other and of course for themselves and theirmother talked on of her dislike of mr darcy and her resolution to becivil to him only as mr bingleys friend without being heard by eitherof them but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not besuspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrsgardiners letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards himto jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refusedand whose merit she had undervalued but to her own more extensiveinformation he was the person to whom the whole family were indebtedfor the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with aninterest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just aswhat jane felt for bingley her astonishment at his comingat hiscoming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her againwas almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his alteredbehaviour in derbyshirethe colour which had been driven from her face returned for half aminute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre toher eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection andwishes must still be unshaken but she would not be securelet me first see how he behaves said she it will then be earlyenough for expectationshe sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring tolift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face ofher sister as the servant was approaching the door jane looked a littlepaler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected on thegentlemens appearing her colour increased yet she received them withtolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from anysymptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisanceelizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat downagain to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command shehad ventured only one glance at darcy he looked serious as usual andshe thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than asshe had seen him at pemberley but perhaps he could not in her motherspresence be what he was before her uncle and aunt it was a painful butnot an improbable conjecturebingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short periodsaw him looking both pleased and embarrassed he was received by mrsbennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamedespecially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness ofher curtsey and address to his friendelizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latterthe preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamywas hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so illapplieddarcy after inquiring of her how mr and mrs gardiner did a questionwhich she could not answer without confusion said scarcely anything hewas not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence butit had not been so in derbyshire there he had talked to her friendswhen he could not to herself but now several minutes elapsed withoutbringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resistthe impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as oftenfound him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object butthe ground more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than whenthey last met were plainly expressed she was disappointed and angrywith herself for being socould i expect it to be otherwise said she yet why did he comeshe was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself and tohim she had hardly courage to speakshe inquired after his sister but could do no moreit is a long time mr bingley since you went away said mrs bennethe readily agreed to iti began to be afraid you would never come back again people did sayyou meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas but however i hopeit is not true a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhoodsince you went away miss lucas is married and settled and one of myown daughters i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must haveseen it in the papers it was in the times and the courier i knowthough it was not put in as it ought to be it was only said latelygeorge wickham esq to miss lydia bennet without there being asyllable said of her father or the place where she lived or anythingit was my brother gardiners drawing up too and i wonder how he came tomake such an awkward business of it did you see itbingley replied that he did and made his congratulations elizabethdared not lift up her eyes how mr darcy looked therefore she couldnot tellit is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married continued her mother but at the same time mr bingley it is veryhard to have her taken such a way from me they are gone down tonewcastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stayi do not know how long his regiment is there for i suppose you haveheard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into theregulars thank heaven he has some friends though perhaps not somany as he deserveselizabeth who knew this to be levelled at mr darcy was in suchmisery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat it drew from herhowever the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectuallydone before and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay inthe country at present a few weeks he believedwhen you have killed all your own birds mr bingley said her motheri beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mrbennets manor i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you andwill save all the best of the covies for youelizabeths misery increased at such unnecessary such officiousattention were the same fair prospect to arise at present as hadflattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would behastening to the same vexatious conclusion at that instant she feltthat years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends formoments of such painful confusionthe first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more tobe in company with either of them their society can afford no pleasurethat will atone for such wretchedness as this let me never see eitherone or the other againyet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer nocompensation received soon afterwards material relief from observinghow much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of herformer lover when first he came in he had spoken to her but littlebut every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention hefound her as handsome as she had been last year as good natured andas unaffected though not quite so chatty jane was anxious that nodifference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuadedthat she talked as much as ever but her mind was so busily engagedthat she did not always know when she was silentwhen the gentlemen rose to go away mrs bennet was mindful of herintended civility and they were invited and engaged to dine atlongbourn in a few days timeyou are quite a visit in my debt mr bingley she added for whenyou went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner withus as soon as you returned i have not forgot you see and i assureyou i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keepyour engagementbingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something ofhis concern at having been prevented by business they then went awaymrs bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dinethere that day but though she always kept a very good table she didnot think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a manon whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and prideof one who had ten thousand a yearas soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spiritsor in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects thatmust deaden them more mr darcys behaviour astonished and vexed herwhy if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said shedid he come at allshe could settle it in no way that gave her pleasurehe could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt whenhe was in town and why not to me if he fears me why come hither ifhe no longer cares for me why silent teasing teasing man i willthink no more about himher resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approachof her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which showed herbetter satisfied with their visitors than elizabethnow said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectlyeasy i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again byhis coming i am glad he dines here on tuesday it will then be publiclyseen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferentacquaintanceyes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly oh janetake caremy dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger nowi think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love withyou as ever                              they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and mrs bennet inthe meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the goodhumour and common politeness of bingley in half an hours visit hadrevivedon tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn and the twowho were most anxiously expected to the credit of their punctualityas sportsmen were in very good time when they repaired to thediningroom elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would takethe place which in all their former parties had belonged to him byher sister her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forboreto invite him to sit by herself on entering the room he seemed tohesitate but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it wasdecided he placed himself by herelizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friendhe bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined thatbingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyeslikewise turned towards mr darcy with an expression of halflaughingalarmhis behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as showed anadmiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuadedelizabeth that if left wholly to himself janes happiness and hisown would be speedily secured though she dared not depend upon theconsequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour itgave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was inno cheerful humour mr darcy was almost as far from her as the tablecould divide them he was on one side of her mother she knew how littlesuch a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear toadvantage she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse butshe could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal andcold was their manner whenever they did her mothers ungraciousnessmade the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeths mindand she would at times have given anything to be privileged to tellhim that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of thefamilyshe was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity ofbringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass awaywithout enabling them to enter into something more of conversation thanthe mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance anxiousand uneasy the period which passed in the drawingroom before thegentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made heruncivil she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which allher chance of pleasure for the evening must dependif he does not come to me then said she i shall give him up foreverthe gentlemen came and she thought he looked as if he would haveanswered her hopes but alas the ladies had crowded round the tablewhere miss bennet was making tea and elizabeth pouring out the coffeein so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near herwhich would admit of a chair and on the gentlemens approaching one ofthe girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisperthe men shant come and part us i am determined we want none of themdo wedarcy had walked away to another part of the room she followed him withher eyes envied everyone to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enoughto help anybody to coffee and then was enraged against herself forbeing so sillya man who has once been refused how could i ever be foolish enough toexpect a renewal of his love is there one among the sex who would notprotest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same womanthere is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelingsshe was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee cuphimself and she seized the opportunity of sayingis your sister at pemberley stillyes she will remain there till christmasand quite alone have all her friends left hermrs annesley is with her the others have been gone on to scarboroughthese three weeksshe could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to conversewith her he might have better success he stood by her however forsome minutes in silence and at last on the young ladys whisperingto elizabeth again he walked awaywhen the teathings were removed and the cardtables placed the ladiesall rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by himwhen all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to hermothers rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seatedwith the rest of the party she now lost every expectation of pleasurethey were confined for the evening at different tables and she hadnothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her sideof the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herselfmrs bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen tosupper but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of theothers and she had no opportunity of detaining themwell girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves whatsay you to the day i think every thing has passed off uncommonly welli assure you the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw thevenison was roasted to a turnand everybody said they never saw sofat a haunch the soup was fifty times better than what we had at thelucases last week and even mr darcy acknowledged that the partridgeswere remarkably well done and i suppose he has two or three frenchcooks at least and my dear jane i never saw you look in greaterbeauty mrs long said so too for i asked her whether you did not andwhat do you think she said besides ah mrs bennet we shall have herat netherfield at last she did indeed i do think mrs long is as gooda creature as ever livedand her nieces are very pretty behaved girlsand not at all handsome i like them prodigiouslymrs bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough ofbingleys behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him atlast and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happyhumour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed atnot seeing him there again the next day to make his proposalsit has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth theparty seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other i hope wemay often meet againelizabeth smiledlizzy you must not do so you must not suspect me it mortifies mei assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as anagreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it i amperfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never hadany design of engaging my affection it is only that he is blessedwith greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generallypleasing than any other manyou are very cruel said her sister you will not let me smile andare provoking me to it every momenthow hard it is in some cases to be believedand how impossible in othersbut why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than iacknowledgethat is a question which i hardly know how to answer we all love toinstruct though we can teach only what is not worth knowing forgiveme and if you persist in indifference do not make me your confidantea few days after this visit mr bingley called again and alone hisfriend had left him that morning for london but was to return home inten days time he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkablygood spirits mrs bennet invited him to dine with them but with manyexpressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewherenext time you call said she i hope we shall be more luckyhe should be particularly happy at any time etc etc and if she wouldgive him leave would take an early opportunity of waiting on themcan you come tomorrowyes he had no engagement at all for tomorrow and her invitation wasaccepted with alacrityhe came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of themdressed in ran mrs bennet to her daughters room in her dressinggown and with her hair half finished crying outmy dear jane make haste and hurry down he is comemr bingley iscome he is indeed make haste make haste here sarah come to missbennet this moment and help her on with her gown never mind misslizzys hairwe will be down as soon as we can said jane but i dare say kitty isforwarder than either of us for she went up stairs half an hour agooh hang kitty what has she to do with it come be quick be quickwhere is your sash my dearbut when her mother was gone jane would not be prevailed on to go downwithout one of her sistersthe same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in theevening after tea mr bennet retired to the library as was hiscustom and mary went up stairs to her instrument two obstacles ofthe five being thus removed mrs bennet sat looking and winking atelizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making anyimpression on them elizabeth would not observe her and when at lastkitty did she very innocently said what is the matter mamma what doyou keep winking at me for what am i to donothing child nothing i did not wink at you she then sat stillfive minutes longer but unable to waste such a precious occasion shesuddenly got up and saying to kitty come here my love i want tospeak to you took her out of the room jane instantly gave a lookat elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation and herentreaty that she would not give in to it in a few minutes mrsbennet halfopened the door and called outlizzy my dear i want to speak with youelizabeth was forced to gowe may as well leave them by themselves you know said her mother assoon as she was in the hall kitty and i are going up stairs to sit inmy dressingroomelizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remainedquietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight then returnedinto the drawingroommrs bennets schemes for this day were ineffectual bingley was everything that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter hisease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to theirevening party and he bore with the illjudged officiousness of themother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and commandof countenance particularly grateful to the daughterhe scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he wentaway an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and mrsbennets means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husbandafter this day jane said no more of her indifference not a word passedbetween the sisters concerning bingley but elizabeth went to bed inthe happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless mr darcyreturned within the stated time seriously however she felt tolerablypersuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentlemansconcurrencebingley was punctual to his appointment and he and mr bennet spentthe morning together as had been agreed on the latter was much moreagreeable than his companion expected there was nothing of presumptionor folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him intosilence and he was more communicative and less eccentric than theother had ever seen him bingley of course returned with him to dinnerand in the evening mrs bennets invention was again at work to getevery body away from him and her daughter elizabeth who had a letterto write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after teafor as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not bewanted to counteract her mothers schemesbut on returning to the drawingroom when her letter was finished shesaw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her motherhad been too ingenious for her on opening the door she perceived hersister and bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged inearnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces ofboth as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other wouldhave told it all their situation was awkward enough but hers shethought was still worse not a syllable was uttered by either andelizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who aswell as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a fewwords to her sister ran out of the roomjane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would givepleasure and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliestemotion that she was the happiest creature in the worldtis too much she added by far too much i do not deserve it ohwhy is not everybody as happyelizabeths congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmtha delight which words could but poorly express every sentence ofkindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane but she would notallow herself to stay with her sister or say half that remained to besaid for the presenti must go instantly to my mother she cried i would not on anyaccount trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear itfrom anyone but myself he is gone to my father already oh lizzy toknow that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dearfamily how shall i bear so much happinessshe then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up thecard party and was sitting up stairs with kittyelizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and easewith which an affair was finally settled that had given them so manyprevious months of suspense and vexationand this said she is the end of all his friends anxiouscircumspection of all his sisters falsehood and contrivance thehappiest wisest most reasonable endin a few minutes she was joined by bingley whose conference with herfather had been short and to the purposewhere is your sister said he hastily as he opened the doorwith my mother up stairs she will be down in a moment i dare sayhe then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishesand affection of a sister elizabeth honestly and heartily expressedher delight in the prospect of their relationship they shook hands withgreat cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listento all he had to say of his own happiness and of janes perfectionsand in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all hisexpectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had forbasis the excellent understanding and superexcellent disposition ofjane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her andhimselfit was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction ofmiss bennets mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face asmade her look handsomer than ever kitty simpered and smiled and hopedher turn was coming soon mrs bennet could not give her consent orspeak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelingsthough she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour and whenmr bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly showedhow really happy he wasnot a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till theirvisitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone heturned to his daughter and saidjane i congratulate you you will be a very happy womanjane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for hisgoodnessyou are a good girl he replied and i have great pleasure inthinking you will be so happily settled i have not a doubt of yourdoing very well together your tempers are by no means unlike you areeach of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on soeasy that every servant will cheat you and so generous that you willalways exceed your incomei hope not so imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would beunpardonable in meexceed their income my dear mr bennet cried his wife what are youtalking of why he has four or five thousand a year and very likelymore then addressing her daughter oh my dear dear jane i am sohappy i am sure i shant get a wink of sleep all night i knew how itwould be i always said it must be so at last i was sure you could notbe so beautiful for nothing i remember as soon as ever i saw him whenhe first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it wasthat you should come together oh he is the handsomest young man thatever was seenwickham lydia were all forgotten jane was beyond competition herfavourite child at that moment she cared for no other her youngersisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happinesswhich she might in future be able to dispensemary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield and kittybegged very hard for a few balls there every winterbingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourncoming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till aftersupper unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enoughdetested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himselfobliged to acceptelizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister forwhile he was present jane had no attention to bestow on anyone elsebut she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hoursof separation that must sometimes occur in the absence of jane healways attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking ofher and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means ofreliefhe has made me so happy said she one evening by telling me that hewas totally ignorant of my being in town last spring i had not believedit possiblei suspected as much replied elizabeth but how did he account foritit must have been his sisters doing they were certainly no friends tohis acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might havechosen so much more advantageously in many respects but when they seeas i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they willlearn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though wecan never be what we once were to each otherthat is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth that i everheard you utter good girl it would vex me indeed to see you againthe dupe of miss bingleys pretended regardwould you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last novemberhe really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my beingindifferent would have prevented his coming down againhe made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of hismodestythis naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence andthe little value he put on his own good qualities elizabeth was pleasedto find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend forthough jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world sheknew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against himi am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed criedjane oh lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessedabove them all if i could but see you as happy if there were butsuch another man for youif you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy asyou till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have yourhappiness no no let me shift for myself and perhaps if i have verygood luck i may meet with another mr collins in timethe situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long asecret mrs bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs phillipsand she ventured without any permission to do the same by all herneighbours in merytonthe
