said in the closest mannerwe were born in the same parish within the same park the greatestpart of our youth was passed together inmates of the same housesharing the same amusements objects of the same parental care myfather began life in the profession which your uncle mr phillipsappears to do so much credit tobut he gave up everything to be ofuse to the late mr darcy and devoted all his time to the care of thepemberley property he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy a mostintimate confidential friend mr darcy often acknowledged himself tobe under the greatest obligations to my fathers active superintendenceand when immediately before my fathers death mr darcy gave him avoluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it tobe as much a debt of gratitude to him as of his affection to myselfhow strange cried elizabeth how abominable i wonder that the verypride of this mr darcy has not made him just to you if from no bettermotive that he should not have been too proud to be dishonestfordishonesty i must call itit is wonderful replied wickham for almost all his actions maybe traced to pride and pride had often been his best friend it hasconnected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling but we arenone of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were strongerimpulses even than pridecan such abominable pride as his have ever done him goodyes it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his moneyfreely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve thepoor family pride and filial pridefor he is very proud of whathis father washave done this not to appear to disgrace his familyto degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of thepemberley house is a powerful motive he has also brotherly pridewhich with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind andcareful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried upas the most attentive and best of brotherswhat sort of girl is miss darcyhe shook his head i wish i could call her amiable it gives me pain tospeak ill of a darcy but she is too much like her brothervery veryproud as a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fondof me and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement but she isnothing to me now she is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteenand i understand highly accomplished since her fathers death herhome has been london where a lady lives with her and superintends hereducationafter many pauses and many trials of other subjects elizabeth could nothelp reverting once more to the first and sayingi am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley how can mr bingleywho seems good humour itself and is i really believe truly amiablebe in friendship with such a man how can they suit each other do youknow mr bingleynot at allhe is a sweettempered amiable charming man he cannot know what mrdarcy isprobably not but mr darcy can please where he chooses he does notwant abilities he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worthhis while among those who are at all his equals in consequence he isa very different man from what he is to the less prosperous hispride never deserts him but with the rich he is liberalminded justsincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeableallowing somethingfor fortune and figurethe whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered roundthe other table and mr collins took his station between his cousinelizabeth and mrs phillips the usual inquiries as to his success weremade by the latter it had not been very great he had lost everypoint but when mrs phillips began to express her concern thereuponhe assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the leastimportance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and beggedthat she would not make herself uneasyi know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to acardtable they must take their chances of these things and happily iam not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object thereare undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to ladycatherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regardinglittle mattersmr wickhams attention was caught and after observing mr collins fora few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relationwas very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourghlady catherine de bourgh she replied has very lately given hima living i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to hernotice but he certainly has not known her longyou know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcywere sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcyno indeed i did not i knew nothing at all of lady catherinesconnections i never heard of her existence till the day beforeyesterdayher daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it isbelieved that she and her cousin will unite the two estatesthis information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor missbingley vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless heraffection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were alreadyselfdestined for anothermr collins said she speaks highly both of lady catherine and herdaughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyshipi suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being hispatroness she is an arrogant conceited womani believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickham i havenot seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never likedher and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent she has thereputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believeshe derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part fromher authoritative manner and the rest from the pride for hernephew who chooses that everyone connected with him should have anunderstanding of the first classelizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it andthey continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supperput an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mrwickhams attentions there could be no conversation in the noiseof mrs phillipss supper party but his manners recommended him toeverybody whatever he said was said well and whatever he did donegracefully elizabeth went away with her head full of him she couldthink of nothing but of mr wickham and of what he had told her allthe way home but there was not time for her even to mention his nameas they went for neither lydia nor mr collins were once silent lydiatalked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and thefish she had won and mr collins in describing the civility of mr andmrs phillips protesting that he did not in the least regard his lossesat whist enumerating all the dishes at supper and repeatedly fearingthat he crowded his cousins had more to say than he could well managebefore the carriage stopped at longbourn houseelizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between mrwickham and herself jane listened with astonishment and concern sheknew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so unworthy of mrbingleys regard and yet it was not in her nature to question theveracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham thepossibility of his having endured such unkindness was enough tointerest all her tender feelings and nothing remained therefore to bedone but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of eachand throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not beotherwise explainedthey have both said she been deceived i dare say in some wayor other of which we can form no idea interested people have perhapsmisrepresented each to the other it is in short impossible for us toconjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated themwithout actual blame on either sidevery true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say onbehalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in thebusiness do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill ofsomebodylaugh as much as you choose but you will not laugh me out of myopinion my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful lightit places mr darcy to be treating his fathers favourite in sucha manner one whom his father had promised to provide for it isimpossible no man of common humanity no man who had any value for hischaracter could be capable of it can his most intimate friends be soexcessively deceived in him oh noi can much more easily believe mr bingleys being imposed on thanthat mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave melast night names facts everything mentioned without ceremony if itbe not so let mr darcy contradict it besides there was truth in hislooksit is difficult indeedit is distressing one does not know what tothinki beg your pardon one knows exactly what to thinkbut jane could think with certainty on only one pointthat mr bingleyif he had been imposed on would have much to suffer when the affairbecame publicthe two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where thisconversation passed by the arrival of the very persons of whom they hadbeen speaking mr bingley and his sisters came to give their personalinvitation for the longexpected ball at netherfield which was fixedfor the following tuesday the two ladies were delighted to see theirdear friend again called it an age since they had met and repeatedlyasked what she had been doing with herself since their separation tothe rest of the family they paid little attention avoiding mrs bennetas much as possible saying not much to elizabeth and nothing at all tothe others they were soon gone again rising from their seats with anactivity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as ifeager to escape from mrs bennets civilitiesthe prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to everyfemale of the family mrs bennet chose to consider it as given incompliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flatteredby receiving the invitation from mr bingley himself instead of aceremonious card jane pictured to herself a happy evening in thesociety of her two friends and the attentions of their brother andelizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mrwickham and of seeing a confirmation of everything in mr darcys lookand behaviour the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia dependedless on any single event or any particular person for though theyeach like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with mr wickhamhe was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and a ballwas at any rate a ball and even mary could assure her family that shehad no disinclination for itwhile i can have my mornings to myself said she it is enoughithink it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagementssociety has claims on us all and i profess myself one of thosewho consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable foreverybodyelizabeths spirits were so high on this occasion that though she didnot often speak unnecessarily to mr collins she could not help askinghim whether he intended to accept mr bingleys invitation and ifhe did whether he would think it proper to join in the eveningsamusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained noscruple whatever on that head and was very far from dreading a rebukeeither from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh by venturing todancei am by no means of the opinion i assure you said he that a ballof this kind given by a young man of character to respectable peoplecan have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancingmyself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my faircousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity ofsoliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especiallya preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the rightcause and not to any disrespect for herelizabeth felt herself completely taken in she had fully proposed beingengaged by mr wickham for those very dances and to have mr collinsinstead her liveliness had never been worse timed there was no helpfor it however mr wickhams happiness and her own were perforcedelayed a little longer and mr collinss proposal accepted with asgood a grace as she could she was not the better pleased with hisgallantry from the idea it suggested of something more it now firststruck her that she was selected from among her sisters as worthyof being mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form aquadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitorsthe idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasingcivilities toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at acompliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished thangratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long beforeher mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriagewas extremely agreeable to her elizabeth however did not chooseto take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be theconsequence of any reply mr collins might never make the offer andtill he did it was useless to quarrel about himif there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of theyounger miss bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at thistime for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball therewas such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to merytononce no aunt no officers no news could be sought afterthe veryshoeroses for netherfield were got by proxy even elizabeth might havefound some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended theimprovement of her acquaintance with mr wickham and nothing less thana dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday andmonday endurable to kitty and lydiatill elizabeth entered the drawingroom at netherfield and looked invain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled adoubt of his being present had never occurred to her the certaintyof meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections thatmight not unreasonably have alarmed her she had dressed with more thanusual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of allthat remained unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more thanmight be won in the course of the evening but in an instant arosethe dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr darcyspleasure in the bingleys invitation to the officers and thoughthis was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence waspronounced by his friend denny to whom lydia eagerly applied and whotold them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business theday before and was not yet returned adding with a significant smilei do not imagine his business would have called him away just now ifhe had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman herethis part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught byelizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable forwickhams absence than if her first surmise had been just everyfeeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediatedisappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility tothe polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to makeattendance forbearance patience with darcy was injury to wickham shewas resolved against any sort of conversation with him and turned awaywith a degree of illhumour which she could not wholly surmount even inspeaking to mr bingley whose blind partiality provoked herbut elizabeth was not formed for illhumour and though every prospectof her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on herspirits and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she hadnot seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary transitionto the oddities of her cousin and to point him out to her particularnotice the first two dances however brought a return of distressthey were dances of mortification mr collins awkward and solemnapologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without beingaware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeablepartner for a couple of dances can give the moment of her release fromhim was ecstasyshe danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking ofwickham and of hearing that he was universally liked when those danceswere over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation withher when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy who tookher so much by surprise in his application for her hand thatwithout knowing what she did she accepted him he walked away againimmediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence ofmind charlotte tried to console heri dare say you will find him very agreeableheaven forbid that would be the greatest misfortune of all to finda man agreeable whom one is determined to hate do not wish me such anevilwhen the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim herhand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be asimpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasantin the eyes of a man ten times his consequence elizabeth made noanswer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to whichshe was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy andreading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholdingit they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began toimagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and atfirst was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it wouldbe the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she madesome slight observation on the dance he replied and was againsilent after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second timewithit is your turn to say something now mr darcy i talkedabout the dance and you ought to make some sort of remark on the sizeof the room or the number of coupleshe smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should besaidvery well that reply will do for the present perhaps by and by i mayobserve that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones butnow we may be silentdo you talk by rule then while you are dancingsometimes one must speak a little you know it would look odd to beentirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage ofsome conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have thetrouble of saying as little as possibleare you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do youimagine that you are gratifying mineboth replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a greatsimilarity in the turn of our minds we are each of an unsocialtaciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to saysomething that will amaze the whole room and be handed down toposterity with all the eclat of a proverbthis is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure said he how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say youthink it a faithful portrait undoubtedlyi must not decide on my own performancehe made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone downthe dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very oftenwalk to meryton she answered in the affirmative and unable to resistthe temptation added when you met us there the other day we had justbeen forming a new acquaintancethe effect was immediate a deeper shade of hauteur overspread hisfeatures but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herselffor her own weakness could not go on at length darcy spoke and in aconstrained manner said mr wickham is blessed with such happy mannersas may ensure his making friendswhether he may be equally capable ofretaining them is less certainhe has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabethwith emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from allhis lifedarcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject atthat moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to passthrough the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving mrdarcy he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him onhis dancing and his partneri have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir such verysuperior dancing is not often seen it is evident that you belong to thefirst circles allow me to say however that your fair partner does notdisgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeatedespecially when a certain desirable event my dear eliza glancing ather sister and bingley shall take place what congratulations will thenflow in i appeal to mr darcybut let me not interrupt you sir youwill not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of thatyoung lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding methe latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sirwilliams allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and hiseyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley andjane who were dancing together recovering himself however shortlyhe turned to his partner and said sir williams interruption has mademe forget what we were talking ofi do not think we were speaking at all sir william could not haveinterrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselveswe have tried two or three subjects already without success and what weare to talk of next i cannot imaginewhat think you of books said he smilingbooksoh no i am sure we never read the same or not with the samefeelingsi am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least beno want of subject we may compare our different opinionsnoi cannot talk of books in a ballroom my head is always full ofsomething elsethe present always occupies you in such scenesdoes it said hewith a look of doubtyes always she replied without knowing what she said for herthoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appearedby her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say mr darcythat you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created wasunappeasable you are very cautious i suppose as to its beingcreatedi am said he with a firm voiceand never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudicei hope notit is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinionto be secure of judging properly at firstmay i ask to what these questions tendmerely to the illustration of your character said she endeavouringto shake off her gravity i am trying to make it outand what is your successshe shook her head i do not get on at all i hear such differentaccounts of you as puzzle me exceedinglyi can readily believe answered he gravely that reports may varygreatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you werenot to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason tofear that the performance would reflect no credit on eitherbut if i do not take your likeness now i may never have anotheropportunityi would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly repliedshe said no more and they went down the other dance and parted insilence and on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degreefor in darcys breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towardsher which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger againstanotherthey had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her andwith an expression of civil disdain accosted herso miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickhamyour sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousandquestions and i find that the young man quite forgot to tell you amonghis other communication that he was the son of old wickham the latemr darcys steward let me recommend you however as a friend not togive implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to mr darcysusing him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he hasalways been remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treatedmr darcy in a most infamous manner i do not know the particulars buti know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to blame that hecannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brotherthought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation tothe officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himselfout of the way his coming into the country at all is a most insolentthing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it i pity youmiss eliza for this discovery of your favourites guilt but reallyconsidering his descent one could not expect much betterhis guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same saidelizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worsethan of being the son of mr darcys steward and of that i canassure you he informed me himselfi beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneerexcuse my interferenceit was kindly meantinsolent girl said elizabeth to herself you are much mistakenif you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this i seenothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mrdarcy she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to makeinquiries on the same subject of bingley jane met her with a smile ofsuch sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficientlymarked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the eveningelizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude forwickham resentment against his enemies and everything else gave waybefore the hope of janes being in the fairest way for happinessi want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than hersisters what you have learnt about mr wickham but perhaps you havebeen too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which caseyou may be sure of my pardonno replied jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothingsatisfactory to tell you mr bingley does not know the whole ofhis history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which haveprincipally offended mr darcy but he will vouch for the good conductthe probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced thatmr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he hasreceived and i am sorry to say by his account as well as his sistersmr wickham is by no means a respectable young man i am afraid he hasbeen very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr darcys regardmr bingley does not know mr wickham himselfno he never saw him till the other morning at merytonthis account then is what he has received from mr darcy i amsatisfied but what does he say of the livinghe does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heardthem from mr darcy more than once but he believes that it was left tohim conditionally onlyi have not a doubt of mr bingleys sincerity said elizabeth warmlybut you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only mrbingleys defense of his friend was a very able one i dare say butsince he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learntthe rest from that friend himself i shall venture to still think ofboth gentlemen as i did beforeshe then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and onwhich there could be no difference of sentiment elizabeth listened withdelight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of mrbingleys regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidencein it on their being joined by mr bingley himself elizabeth withdrewto miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her lastpartner she had scarcely replied before mr collins came up to themand told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate asto make a most important discoveryi have found out said he by a singular accident that there is nowin the room a near relation of my patroness i happened to overhear thegentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours ofthe house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother ladycatherine how wonderfully these sort of things occur who would havethought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine debourgh in this assembly i am most thankful that the discovery is madein time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going todo and trust he will excuse my not having done it before my totalignorance of the connection must plead my apologyyou are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcyindeed i am i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlieri believe him to be lady catherines nephew it will be in my power toassure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday sennightelizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring himthat mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introductionas an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt thatit was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on eitherside and that if it were it must belong to mr darcy the superior inconsequence to begin the acquaintance mr collins listened to herwith the determined air of following his own inclination and when sheceased speaking replied thusmy dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world inyour excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of yourunderstanding but permit me to say that there must be a widedifference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laityand those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe thati consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity withthe highest rank in the kingdomprovided that a proper humility ofbehaviour is at the same time maintained you must therefore allow me tofollow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me toperform what i look on as a point of duty pardon me for neglecting toprofit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constantguide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted byeducation and habitual study to decide on what is right than a younglady like yourself and with a low bow he left her to attack mrdarcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whoseastonishment at being so addressed was very evident her cousin prefacedhis speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word ofit she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips thewords apology hunsford and lady catherine de bourgh it vexedher to see him expose himself to such a man mr darcy was eyeing himwith unrestrained wonder and when at last mr collins allowed him timeto speak replied with an air of distant civility mr collins howeverwas not discouraged from speaking again and mr darcys contempt seemedabundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at theend of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way mrcollins then returned to elizabethi have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with myreception mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention he answeredme with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of sayingthat he was so well convinced of lady catherines discernment as to becertain she could never bestow a favour unworthily it was really a veryhandsome thought upon the whole i am much pleased with himas elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turnedher attention almost entirely on her sister and mr bingley and thetrain of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth tomade her perhaps almost as happy as jane she saw her in idea settled inthat very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affectioncould bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances ofendeavouring even to like bingleys two sisters her mothers thoughtsshe plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not toventure near her lest she might hear too much when they sat down tosupper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness whichplaced them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to findthat her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freelyopenly and of nothing else but her expectation that jane would soonbe married to mr bingley it was an animating subject and mrs bennetseemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of thematch his being such a charming young man and so rich and living butthree miles from them were the first points of selfgratulation andthen it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were ofjane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much asshe could do it was moreover such a promising thing for her youngerdaughters as janes marrying so greatly must throw them in the way ofother rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to beable to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister thatshe might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked it wasnecessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because onsuch occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than mrsbennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life sheconcluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equallyfortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was nochance of itin vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her motherswords or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audiblewhisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that thechief of it was overheard by mr darcy who sat opposite to them hermother only scolded her for being nonsensicalwhat is mr darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him i amsure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to saynothing he may not like to hearfor heavens sake madam speak lower what advantage can it be for youto offend mr darcy you will never recommend yourself to his friend byso doingnothing that she could say however had any influence her mother wouldtalk of her views in the same intelligible tone elizabeth blushed andblushed again with shame and vexation she could not help frequentlyglancing her eye at mr darcy though every glance convinced her of whatshe dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she wasconvinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her the expressionof his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed andsteady gravityat length however mrs bennet had no more to say and lady lucas whohad been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw nolikelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham andchicken elizabeth now began to revive but not long was the interval oftranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of andshe had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreatypreparing to oblige the company by many significant looks and silententreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisancebut in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity ofexhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song elizabethseyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched herprogress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was veryill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanksof the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on tofavour them again after the pause of half a minute began anothermarys powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice wasweak and her manner affected elizabeth was in agonies she looked atjane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking tobingley she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signsof derision at each other and at darcy who continued howeverimperturbably grave she looked at her father to entreat hisinterference lest mary should be singing all night he took the hintand when mary had finished her second song said aloud that will doextremely well child you have delighted us long enough let the otheryoung ladies have time to exhibitmary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted andelizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her fathers speech was afraidher anxiety had done no good others of the party were now applied toif i said mr collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing ishould have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with anair for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectlycompatible with the profession of a clergyman i do not mean howeverto assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our timeto music for there are certainly other things to be attended to therector of a parish has much to do in the first place he must makesuch an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and notoffensive to his patron he must write his own sermons and the timethat remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the careand improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from makingas comfortable as possible and i do not think it of light importancethat he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybodyespecially towards those to whom he owes his preferment i cannot acquithim of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should omit anoccasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with thefamily and with a bow to mr darcy he concluded his speech which hadbeen spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room many staredmanysmiled but no one looked more amused than mr bennet himself while hiswife seriously commended mr collins for having spoken so sensiblyand observed in a halfwhisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkablyclever good kind of young manto elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement toexpose themselves as much as they could during the evening it wouldhave been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit orfiner success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sisterthat some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that hisfeelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which hemust have witnessed that his two sisters and mr darcy however shouldhave such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enoughand she could not determine whether the silent contempt of thegentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerablethe rest of the evening brought her little amusement she was teased bymr collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and thoughhe could not prevail on her to dance with him again put it out of herpower to dance with others in vain did she entreat him to stand up withsomebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the roomhe assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to itthat his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself toher and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to herthe whole evening there was no arguing upon such a project she owedher greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them andgoodnaturedly engaged mr collinss conversation to herselfshe was at least free from the offense of mr darcys further noticethough often standing within a very short distance of her quitedisengaged he never came near enough to speak she felt it to be theprobable consequence of her allusions to mr wickham and rejoiced initthe longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and bya manoeuvre of mrs bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter ofan hour after everybody else was gone which gave them time to see howheartily they were wished away by some of the family mrs hurst and hersister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue andwere evidently impatient to have the house to themselves they repulsedevery attempt of mrs bennet at conversation and by so doing threw alanguor over the whole party which was very little relieved by thelong speeches of mr collins who was complimenting mr bingley and hissisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality andpoliteness which had marked their behaviour to their guests darcy saidnothing at all mr bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scenemr bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from therest and talked only to each other elizabeth preserved as steady asilence as either mrs hurst or miss bingley and even lydia was toomuch fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lordhow tired i am accompanied by a violent yawnwhen at length they arose to take leave mrs bennet was most pressinglycivil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn andaddressed herself especially to mr bingley to assure him how happy hewould make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time withoutthe ceremony of a formal invitation bingley was all grateful pleasureand he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting onher after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the nextday for a short timemrs bennet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under thedelightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations ofsettlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedlysee her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or fourmonths of having another daughter married to mr collins she thoughtwith equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasureelizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though theman and the match were quite good enough for her the worth of eachwas eclipsed by mr bingley and netherfieldthe next day opened a new scene at longbourn mr collins made hisdeclaration in form having resolved to do it without loss of time ashis leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and havingno feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even atthe moment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all theobservances which he supposed a regular part of the business onfinding mrs bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls togethersoon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these wordsmay i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabethwhen i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in thecourse of this morningbefore elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise mrsbennet answered instantly oh dearyescertainly i am sure lizzywill be very happyi am sure she can have no objection come kitty iwant you up stairs and gathering her work together she was hasteningaway when elizabeth called outdear madam do not go i beg you will not go mr collins must excuseme he can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear i amgoing away myselfno no nonsense lizzy i desire you to stay where you are and uponelizabeths seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about toescape she added lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing mrcollinselizabeth would not oppose such an injunctionand a momentsconsideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get itover as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried toconceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided betweendistress and diversion mrs bennet and kitty walked off and as soon asthey were gone mr collins beganbelieve me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far fromdoing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections youwould have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this littleunwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respectedmothers permission for this address you can hardly doubt thepurport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you todissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken almost assoon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion ofmy future life but before i am run away with by my feelings on thissubject perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons formarryingand moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the designof selecting a wife as i certainly didthe idea of mr collins with all his solemn composure being run awaywith by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she couldnot use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him furtherand he continuedmy reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing forevery clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the exampleof matrimony in his parish secondly that i am convinced that it willadd very greatly to my happiness and thirdlywhich perhaps i oughtto have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice andrecommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of callingpatroness twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unaskedtoo on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before ileft hunsfordbetween our pools at quadrille while mrs jenkinson wasarranging miss de bourghs footstool that she said mr collins youmust marry a clergyman like you must marry choose properly choosea gentlewoman for my sake and for your own let her be an activeuseful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a smallincome go a good way this is my advice find such a woman as soon asyou can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her allow me by theway to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the noticeand kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of theadvantages in my power to offer you will find her manners beyondanything i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must beacceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence andrespect which her rank will inevitably excite thus much for my generalintention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my viewswere directed towards longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where ican assure you there are many amiable young women but the fact is thatbeing as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honouredfather who however may live many years longer i could not satisfymyself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters thatthe loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholyevent takes placewhich however as i have already said may notbe for several years this has been my motive my fair cousin andi flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem and now nothingremains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of theviolence of my affection to fortune i am perfectly indifferent andshall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am wellaware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand poundsin the four per cents which will not be yours till after your mothersdecease is all that you may ever be entitled to on that headtherefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself thatno ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are marriedit was absolutely necessary to interrupt him nowyou are too hasty sir she cried you forget that i have made noanswer let me do it without further loss of time accept my thanks forthe compliment you are paying me i am very sensible of the honour ofyour proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than todecline themi am not now to learn replied mr collins with a formal wave of thehand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of theman whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for theirfavour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even athird time i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have justsaid and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere longupon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is a ratherextraordinary one after my declaration i do assure you that i am notone of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are sodaring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a secondtime i am perfectly serious in my refusal you could not make mehappy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world whocould make you so nay were your friend lady catherine to know me iam persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for thesituationwere it certain that lady catherine would think so said mr collinsvery gravelybut i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at alldisapprove of you and you may be certain when i have the honour ofseeing her again i shall speak in the very highest terms of yourmodesty economy and other amiable qualificationindeed mr collins all praise of me will be unnecessary youmust give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the complimentof believing what i say i wish you very happy and very rich and byrefusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwisein making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of yourfeelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbournestate whenever it falls without any selfreproach this matter maybe considered therefore as finally settled and rising as shethus spoke she would have quitted the room had mr collins not thusaddressed herwhen i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject ishall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now givenme though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because iknow it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man onthe first application and perhaps you have even now said as much toencourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of thefemale characterreally mr collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle meexceedingly if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the formof encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way asto convince you of its being oneyou must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that yourrefusal of my addresses is merely words of course my reasons forbelieving it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand isunworthy of your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer wouldbe any other than highly desirable my situation in life my connectionswith the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own arecircumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into furtherconsideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by nomeans certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you yourportion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undothe effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications as i musttherefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of mei shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love bysuspense according to the usual practice of elegant femalesi do assure you sir that i have no pretensions whatever to that kindof elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man i wouldrather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere i thank youagain and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals butto accept them is absolutely impossible my feelings in every respectforbid it can i speak plainer do not consider me now as an elegantfemale intending to plague you but as a rational creature speakingthe truth from her heartyou are uniformly charming cried he with an air of awkwardgallantry and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the expressauthority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail ofbeing acceptableto such perseverance in wilful selfdeception elizabeth would makeno reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined ifhe persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flatteringencouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be utteredin such a manner as to be decisive and whose behaviour at least couldnot be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant femalemr collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of hissuccessful love for mrs bennet having dawdled about in the vestibuleto watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth openthe door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than sheentered the breakfastroom and congratulated both him and herself inwarm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection mr collinsreceived and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and thenproceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the resultof which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since therefusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flowfrom her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her characterthis information however startled mrs bennet she would have beenglad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encouragehim by protesting against his proposals but she dared not believe itand could not help saying sobut depend upon it mr collins she added that lizzy shall bebrought to reason i will speak to her about it directly she is a veryheadstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i willmake her know itpardon me for interrupting you madam cried mr collins but ifshe is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she wouldaltogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation whonaturally looks for happiness in the marriage state if therefore sheactually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better notto force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects oftemper she could not contribute much to my felicitysir you quite misunderstand me said mrs bennet alarmed lizzy isonly headstrong in such matters as these in everything else she is asgoodnatured a girl as ever lived i will go directly to mr bennet andwe shall very soon settle it with her i am sureshe would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to herhusband called out as she entered the library oh mr bennet youare wanted immediately we are all in an uproar you must come and makelizzy marry mr collins for she vows she will not have him and if youdo not make haste he will change his mind and not have hermr bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed themon her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered byher communicationi have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she hadfinished her speech of what are you talkingof mr collins and lizzy lizzy declares she will not have mr collinsand mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzyand what am i to do on the occasion it seems an hopeless businessspeak to lizzy about it yourself tell her that you insist upon hermarrying himlet her be called down she shall hear my opinionmrs bennet rang the bell and miss elizabeth was summoned to thelibrarycome here child cried her father as she appeared i have sent foryou on an affair of importance i understand that mr collins has madeyou an offer of marriage is it true elizabeth replied that it wasvery welland this offer of marriage you have refusedi have sirvery well we now come to the point your mother insists upon youraccepting it is it not so mrs bennetyes or i will never see her againan unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth from this day you mustbe a stranger to one of your parents your mother will never see youagain if you do not marry mr collins and i will never see you againif you doelizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginningbut mrs bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded theaffair as she wished was excessively disappointedwhat do you mean mr bennet in talking this way you promised me toinsist upon her marrying himmy dear replied her husband i have two small favours to requestfirst that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on thepresent occasion and secondly of my room i shall be glad to have thelibrary to myself as soon as may benot yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband didmrs bennet give up the point she talked to elizabeth again and againcoaxed and threatened her by turns she endeavoured to secure janein her interest but jane with all possible mildness declinedinterfering and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness andsometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks though her mannervaried however her determination never didmr collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passedhe thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousincould refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no otherway his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of herdeserving her mothers reproach prevented his feeling any regretwhile the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spendthe day with them she was met in the vestibule by lydia who flying toher cried in a half whisper i am glad you are come for there is suchfun here what do you think has happened this morning mr collins hasmade an offer to lizzy and she will not have himcharlotte hardly had time to answer before they were joined by kittywho came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered thebreakfastroom where mrs bennet was alone than she likewise began onthe subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and entreatingher to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all herfamily pray do my dear miss lucas she added in a melancholy tonefor nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly usednobody feels for my poor nervescharlottes reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabethaye there she comes continued mrs bennet looking as unconcernedas may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york providedshe can have her own way but i tell you miss lizzyif you take itinto your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this wayyou will never get a husband at alland i am sure i do not know who isto maintain you when your father is dead i shall not be able to keepyouand so i warn you i have done with you from this very day i toldyou in the library you know that i should never speak to you againand you will find me as good as my word i have no pleasure in talkingto undutiful children not that i have much pleasure indeed in talkingto anybody people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can haveno great inclination for talking nobody can tell what i suffer but itis always so those who do not complain are never pitiedher daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible thatany attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase theirritation she talked on therefore without interruption from any ofthem till they were joined by mr collins who entered the room withan air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said tothe girls now i do insist upon it that you all of you holdyour tongues and let me and mr collins have a little conversationtogetherelizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed butlydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlottedetained first by the civility of mr collins whose inquiries afterherself and all her family were very minute and then by a littlecuriosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretendingnot to hear in a doleful voice mrs bennet began the projectedconversation oh mr collinsmy dear madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this pointfar be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked hisdispleasure to resent the behaviour of your daughter resignationto inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of ayoung man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early prefermentand i trust i am resigned perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubtof my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her handfor i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect aswhen the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in ourestimation you will not i hope consider me as showing any disrespectto your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions toyour daughters favour without having paid yourself and mr bennet thecompliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in mybehalf my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted mydismission from your daughters lips instead of your own but we are allliable to error i have certainly meant well through the whole affairmy object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with dueconsideration for the advantage of all your family and if my mannerhas been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologisethe discussion of mr collinss offer was now nearly at an end andelizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarilyattending it and occasionally from some peevish allusions of hermother as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chieflyexpressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid herbut by stiffness of manner and resentful silence he scarcely ever spoketo her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible ofhimself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas whosecivility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all andespecially to her friendthe morrow produced no abatement of mrs bennets illhumour or illhealth mr collins was also in the same state of angry pride elizabethhad hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan didnot appear in the least affected by it he was always to have gone onsaturday and to saturday he meant to stayafter breakfast the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr wickhamwere returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ballhe joined them on their entering the town and attended them to theiraunts where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody waswell talked over to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledgedthat the necessity of his absence had been selfimposedi found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meetmr darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for somany hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenesmight arise unpleasant to more than myselfshe highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a fulldiscussion of it and for all the commendation which they civillybestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back withthem to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended toher his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all thecompliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as anoccasion of introducing him to her father and mothersoon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet it camefrom netherfield the envelope contained a sheet of elegant littlehotpressed paper well covered with a ladys fair flowing hand andelizabeth saw her sisters countenance change as she read it and sawher dwelling intently on some particular passages jane recollectedherself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usualcheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxietyon the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and nosooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from janeinvited her to follow her up stairs when they had gained their own roomjane taking out the letter saidthis is from caroline bingley what it contains has surprised me a gooddeal the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are ontheir way to townand without any intention of coming back again youshall hear what she saysshe then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the informationof their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directlyand of their meaning to dine in grosvenor street where mr hurst had ahouse the next was in these words i do not pretend to regret anythingi shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friendbut we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of thatdelightful intercourse we have known and in the meanwhile maylessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreservedcorrespondence i depend on you for that to these highflownexpressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrustand though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she sawnothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that theirabsence from netherfield would prevent mr bingleys being there and asto the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must cease toregard it in the enjoyment of hisit is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not beable to see your friends before they leave the country but may we nothope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looksforward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightfulintercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greatersatisfaction as sisters mr bingley will not be detained in london bythemcaroline decidedly says that none of the party will return intohertfordshire this winter i will read it to youwhen my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business whichtook him to london might be concluded in three or four days but as weare certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when
