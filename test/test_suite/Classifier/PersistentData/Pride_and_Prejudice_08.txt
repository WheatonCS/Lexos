a tone of gentleness and commiserationlet me call your maid is there nothing you could take to give youpresent relief a glass of wine shall i get you one you are very illno i thank you she replied endeavouring to recover herself thereis nothing the matter with me i am quite well i am only distressed bysome dreadful news which i have just received from longbournshe burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes couldnot speak another word darcy in wretched suspense could only saysomething indistinctly of his concern and observe her in compassionatesilence at length she spoke again i have just had a letter from janewith such dreadful news it cannot be concealed from anyone my youngersister has left all her friendshas eloped has thrown herself intothe power ofof mr wickham they are gone off together from brightonyou know him too well to doubt the rest she has no money noconnections nothing that can tempt him toshe is lost for everdarcy was fixed in astonishment when i consider she added in a yetmore agitated voice that i might have prevented it i who knew whathe was had i but explained some part of it onlysome part of what ilearnt to my own family had his character been known this could nothave happened but it is allall too late nowi am grieved indeed cried darcy grievedshocked but is itcertainabsolutely certainoh yes they left brighton together on sunday night and were tracedalmost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone toscotlandand what has been done what has been attempted to recover hermy father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my unclesimmediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in halfanhour butnothing can be donei know very well that nothing can be done how issuch a man to be worked on how are they even to be discovered i havenot the smallest hope it is every way horribledarcy shook his head in silent acquiescencewhen my eyes were opened to his real characteroh had i known whati ought what i dared to do but i knew noti was afraid of doing toomuch wretched wretched mistakedarcy made no answer he seemed scarcely to hear her and was walkingup and down the room in earnest meditation his brow contracted his airgloomy elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it herpower was sinking everything must sink under such a proof of familyweakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace she could neitherwonder nor condemn but the belief of his selfconquest brought nothingconsolatory to her bosom afforded no palliation of her distress itwas on the contrary exactly calculated to make her understand her ownwishes and never had she so honestly felt that she could have lovedhim as now when all love must be vainbut self though it would intrude could not engross her lydiathehumiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowedup every private care and covering her face with her handkerchiefelizabeth was soon lost to everything else and after a pause ofseveral minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation bythe voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spokecompassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have beenlong desiring my absence nor have i anything to plead in excuse of mystay but real though unavailing concern would to heaven that anythingcould be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation tosuch distress but i will not torment you with vain wishes which mayseem purposely to ask for your thanks this unfortunate affair will ifear prevent my sisters having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberleytodayoh yes be so kind as to apologise for us to miss darcy say thaturgent business calls us home immediately conceal the unhappy truth aslong as it is possible i know it cannot be longhe readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow forher distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at presentreason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with onlyone serious parting look went awayas he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that theyshould ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality ashad marked their several meetings in derbyshire and as she threw aretrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so fullof contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of thosefeelings which would now have promoted its continuance and wouldformerly have rejoiced in its terminationif gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection elizabethschange of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty but ifotherwiseif regard springing from such sources is unreasonable orunnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising ona first interview with its object and even before two words have beenexchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had givensomewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickhamand that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the otherless interesting mode of attachment be that as it may she saw himgo with regret and in this early example of what lydias infamy mustproduce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretchedbusiness never since reading janes second letter had she entertaineda hope of wickhams meaning to marry her no one but jane she thoughtcould flatter herself with such an expectation surprise was the leastof her feelings on this development while the contents of the firstletter remained in her mind she was all surpriseall astonishment thatwickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marryfor money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appearedincomprehensible but now it was all too natural for such an attachmentas this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not supposelydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intentionof marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtuenor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy preyshe had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire thatlydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydiawanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody sometimes oneofficer sometimes another had been her favourite as their attentionsraised them in her opinion her affections had continually beenfluctuating but never without an object the mischief of neglect andmistaken indulgence towards such a girloh how acutely did she nowfeel itshe was wild to be at hometo hear to see to be upon the spot toshare with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in afamily so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion andrequiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothingcould be done for lydia her uncles interference seemed of the utmostimportance and till he entered the room her impatience was severe mrand mrs gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servantsaccount that their niece was taken suddenly ill but satisfying theminstantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of theirsummons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscriptof the last with trembling energythough lydia had never been afavourite with them mr and mrs gardiner could not but be deeplyafflicted not lydia only but all were concerned in it and after thefirst exclamations of surprise and horror mr gardiner promised everyassistance in his power elizabeth though expecting no less thankedhim with tears of gratitude and all three being actuated by one spiriteverything relating to their journey was speedily settled they were tobe off as soon as possible but what is to be done about pemberley cried mrs gardiner john told us mr darcy was here when you sent forus was it soyes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagementthat is all settledwhat is all settled repeated the other as she ran into her room toprepare and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the realtruth oh that i knew how it wasbut wishes were vain or at least could only serve to amuse her in thehurry and confusion of the following hour had elizabeth been at leisureto be idle she would have remained certain that all employment wasimpossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share ofbusiness as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes tobe written to all their friends at lambton with false excuses for theirsudden departure an hour however saw the whole completed and mrgardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothingremained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery ofthe morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she couldhave supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourni have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as theydrove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am muchmore inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does on thematter it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man shouldform such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected orfriendless and who was actually staying in his colonels family that iam strongly inclined to hope the best could he expect that her friendswould not step forward could he expect to be noticed again by theregiment after such an affront to colonel forster his temptation isnot adequate to the riskdo you really think so cried elizabeth brightening up for a momentupon my word said mrs gardiner i begin to be of your unclesopinion it is really too great a violation of decency honour andinterest for him to be guilty of i cannot think so very ill ofwickham can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believehim capable of itnot perhaps of neglecting his own interest but of every otherneglect i can believe him capable if indeed it should be so but idare not hope it why should they not go on to scotland if that had beenthe casein the first place replied mr gardiner there is no absolute proofthat they are not gone to scotlandoh but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is sucha presumption and besides no traces of them were to be found on thebarnet roadwell thensupposing them to be in london they may be there thoughfor the purpose of concealment for no more exceptional purpose it isnot likely that money should be very abundant on either side and itmight strike them that they could be more economically though lessexpeditiously married in london than in scotlandbut why all this secrecy why any fear of detection why must theirmarriage be private oh no nothis is not likely his most particularfriend you see by janes account was persuaded of his never intendingto marry her wickham will never marry a woman without some money hecannot afford it and what claims has lydiawhat attraction has shebeyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sakeforego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well as to whatrestraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on adishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i knownothing of the effects that such a step might produce but as to yourother objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good lydia hasno brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my fathersbehaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has everseemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he woulddo as little and think as little about it as any father could do insuch a matterbut can you think that lydia is so lost to everything but love of himas to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriageit does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth withtears in her eyes that a sisters sense of decency and virtue in sucha point should admit of doubt but really i know not what to sayperhaps i am not doing her justice but she is very young she has neverbeen taught to think on serious subjects and for the last halfyearnay for a twelvemonthshe has been given up to nothing but amusementand vanity she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idleand frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her waysince the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but loveflirtation and officers have been in her head she has been doingeverything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to givegreaterwhat shall i call it susceptibility to her feelings which arenaturally lively enough and we all know that wickham has every charm ofperson and address that can captivate a womanbut you see that jane said her aunt does not think so very ill ofwickham as to believe him capable of the attemptof whom does jane ever think ill and who is there whatever might betheir former conduct that she would think capable of such an attempttill it were proved against them but jane knows as well as i do whatwickham really is we both know that he has been profligate in everysense of the word that he has neither integrity nor honour that he isas false and deceitful as he is insinuatingand do you really know all this cried mrs gardiner whose curiosityas to the mode of her intelligence was all alivei do indeed replied elizabeth colouring i told you the other dayof his infamous behaviour to mr darcy and you yourself when last atlongbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behavedwith such forbearance and liberality towards him and there are othercircumstances which i am not at libertywhich it is not worth while torelate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless fromwhat he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proudreserved disagreeable girl yet he knew to the contrary himself hemust know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have foundherbut does lydia know nothing of this can she be ignorant of what youand jane seem so well to understandoh yesthat that is the worst of all till i was in kent and sawso much both of mr darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i wasignorant of the truth myself and when i returned home the shirewas to leave meryton in a week or fortnights time as that was thecase neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought itnecessary to make our knowledge public for of what use couldit apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all theneighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown and even when it wassettled that lydia should go with mrs forster the necessity of openingher eyes to his character never occurred to me that she could bein any danger from the deception never entered my head that such aconsequence as this could ensue you may easily believe was farenough from my thoughtswhen they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason isuppose to believe them fond of each othernot the slightest i can remember no symptom of affection on eitherside and had anything of the kind been perceptible you must be awarethat ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away when firsthe entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we allwere every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him forthe first two months but he never distinguished her by any particularattention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant andwild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regimentwho treated her with more distinction again became her favourites                              it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be addedto their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject byits repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long duringthe whole of the journey from elizabeths thoughts it was never absentfixed there by the keenest of all anguish selfreproach she could findno interval of ease or forgetfulnessthey travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one nighton the road reached longbourn by dinner time the next day it was acomfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been weariedby long expectationsthe little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standingon the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when thecarriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up theirfaces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety ofcapers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcomeelizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them a hasty kisshurried into the vestibule where jane who came running down from hermothers apartment immediately met herelizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled theeyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether anything had beenheard of the fugitivesnot yet replied jane but now that my dear uncle is come i hopeeverything will be wellis my father in townyes he went on tuesday as i wrote you wordand have you heard from him oftenwe have heard only twice he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to saythat he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which iparticularly begged him to do he merely added that he should not writeagain till he had something of importance to mentionand my motherhow is she how are you allmy mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatlyshaken she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing youall she does not yet leave her dressingroom mary and kitty thankheaven are quite wellbut youhow are you cried elizabeth you look pale how much youmust have gone throughher sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and theirconversation which had been passing while mr and mrs gardiner wereengaged with their children was now put an end to by the approachof the whole party jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed andthanked them both with alternate smiles and tearswhen they were all in the drawingroom the questions which elizabethhad already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soonfound that jane had no intelligence to give the sanguine hope ofgood however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yetdeserted her she still expected that it would all end well and thatevery morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her fatherto explain their proceedings and perhaps announce their marriagemrs bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutesconversation together received them exactly as might be expected withtears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villainousconduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and illusageblaming everybody but the person to whose illjudging indulgence theerrors of her daughter must principally be owingif i had been able said she to carry my point in going to brightonwith all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydiahad nobody to take care of her why did the forsters ever let her go outof their sight i am sure there was some great neglect or other on theirside for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had beenwell looked after i always thought they were very unfit to have thecharge of her but i was overruled as i always am poor dear childand now heres mr bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickhamwherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to becomeof us all the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in hisgrave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what weshall dothey all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and mr gardiner aftergeneral assurances of his affection for her and all her family told herthat he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist mrbennet in every endeavour for recovering lydiado not give way to useless alarm added he though it is right to beprepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certainit is not quite a week since they left brighton in a few days more wemay gain some news of them and till we know that they are not marriedand have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over aslost as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and makehim come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consulttogether as to what is to be doneoh my dear brother replied mrs bennet that is exactly what icould most wish for and now do when you get to town find them outwherever they may be and if they are not married already make themmarry and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that buttell lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy themafter they are married and above all keep mr bennet from fightingtell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frighted out of mywitsand have such tremblings such flutterings all over mesuchspasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart thati can get no rest by night nor by day and tell my dear lydia not togive any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she doesnot know which are the best warehouses oh brother how kind you are iknow you will contrive it allbut mr gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavoursin the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as wellin her hopes as her fear and after talking with her in this manner tilldinner was on the table they all left her to vent all her feelings onthe housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughtersthough her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no realoccasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt tooppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold hertongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged itbetter that one only of the household and the one whom they couldmost trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on thesubjectin the diningroom they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had beentoo busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearancebefore one came from her books and the other from her toilette thefaces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visiblein either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the angerwhich she had herself incurred in this business had given more offretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty as for mary she wasmistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenanceof grave reflection soon after they were seated at tablethis is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked ofbut we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms ofeach other the balm of sisterly consolationthen perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she addedunhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this usefullesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that onefalse step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no lessbrittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded inher behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sexelizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressedto make any reply mary however continued to console herself with suchkind of moral extractions from the evil before themin the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be forhalfanhour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself ofthe opportunity of making any inquiries which jane was equally eager tosatisfy after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequelof this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and missbennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continuedthe subject by saying but tell me all and everything about it whichi have not already heard give me further particulars what did colonelforster say had they no apprehension of anything before the elopementtook place they must have seen them together for evercolonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partialityespecially on lydias side but nothing to give him any alarm i am sogrieved for him his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost hewas coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he hadany idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehensionfirst got abroad it hastened his journeyand was denny convinced that wickham would not marry did he know oftheir intending to go off had colonel forster seen denny himselfyes but when questioned by him denny denied knowing anything oftheir plans and would not give his real opinion about it he did notrepeat his persuasion of their not marryingand from that i aminclined to hope he might have been misunderstood beforeand till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained adoubt i suppose of their being really marriedhow was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains i felta little uneasya little fearful of my sisters happiness with himin marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quiteright my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt howimprudent a match it must be kitty then owned with a very naturaltriumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydias last lettershe had prepared her for such a step she had known it seems of theirbeing in love with each other many weeksbut not before they went to brightonno i believe notand did colonel forster appear to think well of wickham himself doeshe know his real characteri must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerlydid he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant and since this sadaffair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debtbut i hope this may be falseoh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of himthis could not have happenedperhaps it would have been better replied her sister but to exposethe former faults of any person without knowing what their presentfeelings were seemed unjustifiable we acted with the best intentionscould colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydias note to hiswifehe brought it with him for us to seejane then took it from her pocketbook and gave it to elizabeth thesewere the contentsmy dear harrietyou will laugh when you know where i am gone and i cannot helplaughing myself at your surprise tomorrow morning as soon as i ammissed i am going to gretna green and if you cannot guess with whoi shall think you a simpleton for there is but one man in the world ilove and he is an angel i should never be happy without him so thinkit no harm to be off you need not send them word at longbourn of mygoing if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greaterwhen i write to them and sign my name lydia wickham what a good jokeit will be i can hardly write for

we meet with great pleasure i shallsend for my clothes when i get to longbourn but i wish you would tellsally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they arepacked up goodbye give my love to colonel forster i hope you willdrink to our good journeyyour affectionate friendlydia bennetoh thoughtless thoughtless lydia cried elizabeth when she hadfinished it what a letter is this to be written at such a momentbut at least it shows that she was serious on the subject of theirjourney whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on herside a scheme of infamy my poor father how he must have felt iti never saw anyone so shocked he could not speak a word for full tenminutes my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house insuch confusionoh jane cried elizabeth was there a servant belonging to it whodid not know the whole story before the end of the dayi do not know i hope there was but to be guarded at such a time isvery difficult my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured togive her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do somuch as i might have done but the horror of what might possibly happenalmost took from me my facultiesyour attendance upon her has been too much for you you do not lookwell oh that i had been with you you have had every care and anxietyupon yourself alonemary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in everyfatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of themkitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hoursof repose should not be broken in on my aunt phillips came to longbournon tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay tillthursday with me she was of great use and comfort to us all andlady lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning tocondole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters ifthey should be of use to usshe had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth perhaps shemeant well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot seetoo little of ones neighbours assistance is impossible condolenceinsufferable let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfiedshe then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father hadintended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughterhe meant i believe replied jane to go to epsom the place wherethey last changed horses see the postilions and try if anything couldbe made out from them his principal object must be to discover thenumber of the hackney coach which took them from clapham it had comewith a fare from london and as he thought that the circumstance of agentleman and ladys removing from one carriage into another mightbe remarked he meant to make inquiries at clapham if he could anyhowdiscover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare hedetermined to make inquiries there and hoped it might not be impossibleto find out the stand and number of the coach i do not know of anyother designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be goneand his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in findingout even so much as thisthe whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr bennet the nextmorning but the post came in without bringing a single line from himhis family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent anddilatory correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertionthey were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence tosend but even of that they would have been glad to be certain mrgardiner had waited only for the letters before he set offwhen he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constantinformation of what was going on and their uncle promised at partingto prevail on mr bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he couldto the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the onlysecurity for her husbands not being killed in a duelmrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a fewdays longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceableto her nieces she shared in their attendance on mrs bennet and was agreat comfort to them in their hours of freedom their other aunt alsovisited them frequently and always as she said with the design ofcheering and heartening them upthough as she never came withoutreporting some fresh instance of wickhams extravagance or irregularityshe seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she foundthemall meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who but three monthsbefore had been almost an angel of light he was declared to be in debtto every tradesman in the place and his intrigues all honoured withthe title of seduction had been extended into every tradesmans familyeverybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the worldand everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted theappearance of his goodness elizabeth though she did not credit abovehalf of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance ofher sisters ruin more certain and even jane who believed still lessof it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now comewhen if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirelydespaired of they must in all probability have gained some news ofthemmr gardiner left longbourn on sunday on tuesday his wife received aletter from him it told them that on his arrival he had immediatelyfound out his brother and persuaded him to come to gracechurch streetthat mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrivalbut without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was nowdetermined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town as mr bennetthought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their firstcoming to london before they procured lodgings mr gardiner himselfdid not expect any success from this measure but as his brother waseager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it he added that mrbennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promisedto write again very soon there was also a postscript to this effecti have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out ifpossible from some of the young mans intimates in the regimentwhether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely toknow in what part of town he has now concealed himself if there wereanyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such aclue as that it might be of essential consequence at present we havenothing to guide us colonel forster will i dare say do everything inhis power to satisfy us on this head but on second thoughts perhapslizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than anyother personelizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to herauthority proceeded but it was not in her power to give any informationof so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved she had neverheard of his having had any relations except a father and mother bothof whom had been dead many years it was possible however that some ofhis companions in the shire might be able to give more informationand though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the applicationwas a something to look forward toevery day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most anxiouspart of each was when the post was expected the arrival of letterswas the grand object of every mornings impatience through letterswhatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated and everysucceeding day was expected to bring some news of importancebut before they heard again from mr gardiner a letter arrived fortheir father from a different quarter from mr collins which as janehad received directions to open all that came for him in his absenceshe accordingly read and elizabeth who knew what curiosities hisletters always were looked over her and read it likewise it was asfollowsmy dear siri feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situationin life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are nowsuffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter fromhertfordshire be assured my dear sir that mrs collins and myselfsincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family inyour present distress which must be of the bitterest kind becauseproceeding from a cause which no time can remove no arguments shall bewanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortuneor thatmay comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others themost afflicting to a parents mind the death of your daughter wouldhave been a blessing in comparison of this and it is the more tobe lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotteinforms me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter hasproceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though at the same timefor the consolation of yourself and mrs bennet i am inclined to thinkthat her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not beguilty of such an enormity at so early an age howsoever that may beyou are grievously to be pitied in which opinion i am not only joinedby mrs collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter towhom i have related the affair they agree with me in apprehending thatthis false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes ofall the others for who as lady catherine herself condescendingly sayswill connect themselves with such a family and this consideration leadsme moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain eventof last november for had it been otherwise i must have been involvedin all your sorrow and disgrace let me then advise you dear sir toconsole yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy childfrom your affection for ever and leave her to reap the fruits of herown heinous offensei am dear sir etc etcmr gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer fromcolonel forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to sendit was not known that wickham had a single relationship with whom hekept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near oneliving his former acquaintances had been numerous but since hehad been in the militia it did not appear that he was on terms ofparticular friendship with any of them there was no one thereforewho could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him and in thewretched state of his own finances there was a very powerful motive forsecrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by lydias relations forit had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to avery considerable amount colonel forster believed that more than athousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at brightonhe owed a good deal in town but his debts of honour were still moreformidable mr gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particularsfrom the longbourn family jane heard them with horror a gamester she cried this is wholly unexpected i had not an idea of itmr gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see theirfather at home on the following day which was saturday renderedspiritless by the illsuccess of all their endeavours he had yieldedto his brotherinlaws entreaty that he would return to his family andleave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisablefor continuing their pursuit when mrs bennet was told of this she didnot express so much satisfaction as her children expected consideringwhat her anxiety for his life had been beforewhat is he coming home and without poor lydia she cried sure hewill not leave london before he has found them who is to fight wickhamand make him marry her if he comes awayas mrs gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that sheand the children should go to london at the same time that mr bennetcame from it the coach therefore took them the first stage of theirjourney and brought its master back to longbournmrs gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and herderbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world hisname had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece andthe kind of halfexpectation which mrs gardiner had formed of theirbeing followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing elizabeth hadreceived none since her return that could come from pemberleythe present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse forthe lowness of her spirits unnecessary nothing therefore could befairly conjectured from that though elizabeth who was by this timetolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly awarethat had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread oflydias infamy somewhat better it would have spared her she thoughtone sleepless night out of twowhen mr bennet arrived he had all the appearance of his usualphilosophic composure he said as little as he had ever been in thehabit of saying made no mention of the business that had taken himaway and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak ofitit was not till the afternoon when he had joined them at tea thatelizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then on her brieflyexpressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied saynothing of that who should suffer but myself it has been my own doingand i ought to feel ityou must not be too severe upon yourself replied elizabethyou may well warn me against such an evil human nature is so proneto fall into it no lizzy let me once in my life feel how much i havebeen to blame i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impressionit will pass away soon enoughdo you suppose them to be in londonyes where else can they be so well concealedand lydia used to want to go to london added kittyshe is happy then said her father drily and her residence therewill probably be of some durationthen after a short silence he continuedlizzy i bear you no illwill for being justified in your advice to melast may which considering the event shows some greatness of mindthey were interrupted by miss bennet who came to fetch her mothersteathis is a parade he cried which does one good it gives such anelegance to misfortune another day i will do the same i will sit in mylibrary in my nightcap and powdering gown and give as much trouble asi can or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs awayi am not going to run away papa said kitty fretfully if i shouldever go to brighton i would behave better than lydiayou go to brighton i would not trust you so near it as eastbournefor fifty pounds no kitty i have at last learnt to be cautious andyou will feel the effects of it no officer is ever to enter intomy house again nor even to pass through the village balls will beabsolutely prohibited unless you stand up with one of your sistersand you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you havespent ten minutes of every day in a rational mannerkitty who took all these threats in a serious light began to crywell well said he do not make yourself unhappy if you are a goodgirl for the next ten years i will take you to a review at the end ofthemtwo days after mr bennets return as jane and elizabeth were walkingtogether in the shrubbery behind the house they saw the housekeepercoming towards them and concluding that she came to call them to theirmother went forward to meet her but instead of the expected summonswhen they approached her she said to miss bennet i beg your pardonmadam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have got somegood news from town so i took the liberty of coming to askwhat do you mean hill we have heard nothing from towndear madam cried mrs hill in great astonishment dont you knowthere is an express come for master from mr gardiner he has been herethis halfhour and master has had a letteraway ran the girls too eager to get in to have time for speech theyran through the vestibule into the breakfastroom from thence to thelibrary their father was in neither and they were on the point ofseeking him up stairs with their mother when they were met by thebutler who saidif you are looking for my master maam he is walking towards thelittle copseupon this information they instantly passed through the hall oncemore and ran across the lawn after their father who was deliberatelypursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddockjane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running aselizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breathcame up with him and eagerly cried outoh papa what newswhat news have you heard from my uncleyes i have had a letter from him by expresswell and what news does it bringgood or badwhat is there of good to be expected said he taking the letter fromhis pocket but perhaps you would like to read itelizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand jane now came upread it aloud said their father for i hardly know myself what it isaboutgracechurch street monday august my dear brotherat last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such asupon the whole i hope it will give you satisfaction soon after youleft me on saturday i was fortunate enough to find

marriedelizabeth read oni have seen them both they are not married nor can i find therewas any intention of being so but if you are willing to perform theengagements which i have ventured to make on your side i hope it willnot be long before they are all that is required of you is to assureto your daughter by settlement her equal share of the five thousandpounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself andmy sister and moreover to enter into an engagement of allowing herduring your life one hundred pounds per annum these are conditionswhich considering everything i had no hesitation in complying withas far as i thought myself privileged for you i shall send this byexpress that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer youwill easily comprehend from these particulars that mr wickhamscircumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to bethe world has been deceived in that respect and i am happy to say therewill be some little money even when all his debts are discharged tosettle on my niece in addition to her own fortune if as i concludewill be the case you send me full powers to act in your name throughoutthe whole of this business i will immediately give directions tohaggerston for preparing a proper settlement there will not be thesmallest occasion for your coming to town again therefore stay quiet atlongbourn and depend on my diligence and care send back your answer asfast as you can and be careful to write explicitly we have judged itbest that my niece should be married from this house of which i hopeyou will approve she comes to us today i shall write again as soon asanything more is determined on yours etcedw gardineris it possible cried elizabeth when she had finished can it bepossible that he will marry herwickham is not so undeserving then as we thought him said hersister my dear father i congratulate youand have you answered the letter cried elizabethno but it must be done soonmost earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before hewroteoh my dear father she cried come back and write immediatelyconsider how important every moment is in such a caselet me write for you said jane if you dislike the troubleyourselfi dislike it very much he replied but it must be doneand so saying he turned back with them and walked towards the houseand may i ask said elizabeth but the terms i suppose must becomplied withcomplied with i am only ashamed of his asking so littleand they must marry yet he is such a manyes yes they must marry there is nothing else to be done but thereare two things that i want very much to know one is how much moneyyour uncle has laid down to bring it about and the other how am i everto pay himmoney my uncle cried jane what do you mean siri mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight atemptation as one hundred a year during my life and fifty after i amgonethat is very true said elizabeth though it had not occurred to mebefore his debts to be discharged and something still to remain ohit must be my uncles doings generous good man i am afraid he hasdistressed himself a small sum could not do all thisno said her father wickhams a fool if he takes her with a farthingless than ten thousand pounds i should be sorry to think so ill of himin the very beginning of our relationshipten thousand pounds heaven forbid how is half such a sum to berepaidmr bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continuedsilent till they reached the house their father then went on to thelibrary to write and the girls walked into the breakfastroomand they are really to be married cried elizabeth as soon as theywere by themselves how strange this is and for this we are to bethankful that they should marry small as is their chance of happinessand wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice oh lydiai comfort myself with thinking replied jane that he certainly wouldnot marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her though our kinduncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that tenthousand pounds or anything like it has been advanced he has childrenof his own and may have more how could he spare half ten thousandpoundsif he were ever able to learn what wickhams debts have been saidelizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shallexactly know what mr gardiner has done for them because wickham hasnot sixpence of his own the kindness of my uncle and aunt can neverbe requited their taking her home and affording her their personalprotection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage asyears of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge by this time she isactually with them if such goodness does not make her miserable nowshe will never deserve to be happy what a meeting for her when shefirst sees my auntwe must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side saidjane i hope and trust they will yet be happy his consenting tomarry her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way ofthinking their mutual affection will steady them and i flatter myselfthey will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may intime make their past imprudence forgottentheir conduct has been such replied elizabeth as neither you nori nor anybody can ever forget it is useless to talk of itit now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihoodperfectly ignorant of what had happened they went to the librarytherefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to makeit known to her he was writing and without raising his head coollyrepliedjust as you pleasemay we take my uncles letter to read to hertake whatever you like and get awayelizabeth took the letter from his writingtable and they went up stairstogether mary and kitty were both with mrs bennet one communicationwould therefore do for all after a slight preparation for good newsthe letter was read aloud mrs bennet could hardly contain herself assoon as jane had read mr gardiners hope of lydias being soonmarried her joy burst forth and every following sentence added to itsexuberance she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as shehad ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation to know that her daughterwould be married was enough she was disturbed by no fear for herfelicity nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconductmy dear dear lydia she cried this is delightful indeed she willbe married i shall see her again she will be married at sixteenmy good kind brother i knew how it would be i knew he would manageeverything how i long to see her and to see dear wickham too but theclothes the wedding clothes i will write to my sister gardiner aboutthem directly lizzy my dear run down to your father and ask himhow much he will give her stay stay i will go myself ring the bellkitty for hill i will put on my things in a moment my dear dearlydia how merry we shall be together when we meether eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence ofthese transports by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mrgardiners behaviour laid them all underfor we must attribute this happy conclusion she added in a greatmeasure to his kindness we are persuaded that he has pledged himself toassist mr wickham with moneywell cried her mother it is all very right who should do it buther own uncle if he had not had a family of his own i and my childrenmust have had all his money you know and it is the first time we haveever had anything from him except a few presents well i am so happyin a short time i shall have a daughter married mrs wickham how wellit sounds and she was only sixteen last june my dear jane i am insuch a flutter that i am sure i cant write so i will dictate andyou write for me we will settle with your father about the moneyafterwards but the things should be ordered immediatelyshe was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico muslin andcambric and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders hadnot jane though with some difficulty persuaded her to wait till herfather was at leisure to be consulted one days delay she observedwould be of small importance and her mother was too happy to be quiteso obstinate as usual other schemes too came into her headi will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dressed and tell thegood good news to my sister philips and as i come back i can callon lady lucas and mrs long kitty run down and order the carriagean airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure girls can i doanything for you in meryton oh here comes hill my dear hill have youheard the good news miss lydia is going to be married and you shallall have a bowl of punch to make merry at her weddingmrs hill began instantly to express her joy elizabeth received hercongratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this folly tookrefuge in her own room that she might think with freedompoor lydias situation must at best be bad enough but that it wasno worse she had need to be thankful she felt it so and though inlooking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity couldbe justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they hadfeared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they hadgainedmr bennet had very often wished before this period of his life thatinstead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum forthe better provision of his children and of his wife if she survivedhim he now wished it more than ever had he done his duty in thatrespect lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whateverof honour or credit could now be purchased for her the satisfaction ofprevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to beher husband might then have rested in its proper placehe was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyoneshould be forwarded at the sole expense of his brotherinlaw and hewas determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistanceand to discharge the obligation as soon as he couldwhen first mr bennet had married economy was held to be perfectlyuseless for of course they were to have a son the son was to joinin cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widowand younger children would by that means be provided for five daughterssuccessively entered the world but yet the son was to come and mrsbennet for many years after lydias birth had been certain that hewould this event had at last been despaired of but it was thentoo late to be saving mrs bennet had no turn for economy and herhusbands love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding theirincomefive thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs bennet andthe children but in what proportions it should be divided amongst thelatter depended on the will of the parents this was one point withregard to lydia at least which was now to be settled and mr bennetcould have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him interms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brotherthough expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfectapprobation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil theengagements that had been made for him he had never before supposedthat could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it wouldbe done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the presentarrangement he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by thehundred that was to be paid them for what with her board and pocketallowance and the continual presents in money which passed to herthrough her mothers hands lydias expenses had been very little withinthat sumthat it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too wasanother very welcome surprise for his wish at present was to have aslittle trouble in the business as possible when the first transportsof rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over henaturally returned to all his former indolence his letter was soondispatched for though dilatory in undertaking business he was quickin its execution he begged to know further particulars of what hewas indebted to his brother but was too angry with lydia to send anymessage to herthe good news spread quickly through the house and with proportionatespeed through the neighbourhood it was borne in the latter with decentphilosophy to be sure it would have been more for the advantageof conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as thehappiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distantfarmhouse but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and thegoodnatured wishes for her welldoing which had proceeded before fromall the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but a little of their spiritin this change of circumstances because with such an husband her miserywas considered certainit was a fortnight since mrs bennet had been downstairs but on thishappy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and inspirits oppressively high no sentiment of shame gave a damp to hertriumph the marriage of a daughter which had been the first objectof her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point ofaccomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on thoseattendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new carriages andservants she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for aproper situation for her daughter and without knowing or consideringwhat their income might be rejected many as deficient in size andimportancehaye park might do said she if the gouldings could quit itor thegreat house at stoke if the drawingroom were larger but ashworth istoo far off i could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as forpulvis lodge the attics are dreadfulher husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while theservants remained but when they had withdrawn he said to her mrsbennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son anddaughter let us come to a right understanding into one house in thisneighbourhood they shall never have admittance i will not encourage theimpudence of either by receiving them at longbourna long dispute followed this declaration but mr bennet was firm itsoon led to another and mrs bennet found with amazement and horrorthat her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for hisdaughter he protested that she should receive from him no mark ofaffection whatever on the occasion mrs bennet could hardly comprehendit that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivableresentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which hermarriage would scarcely seem valid exceeded all she could believepossible she was more alive to the disgrace which her want of newclothes must reflect on her daughters nuptials than to any sense ofshame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before theytook placeelizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from the distress ofthe moment been led to make mr darcy acquainted with their fears forher sister for since her marriage would so shortly give theproper termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal itsunfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on thespotshe had no fear of its spreading farther through his means there werefew people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently dependedbut at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sistersfrailty would have mortified her so muchnot however from any fearof disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any ratethere seemed a gulf impassable between them had lydias marriage beenconcluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed thatmr darcy would connect himself with a family where to every otherobjection would now be added an alliance and relationship of thenearest kind with a man whom he so justly scornedfrom such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink thewish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of hisfeeling in derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such ablow as this she was humbled she was grieved she repented though shehardly knew of what she became jealous of his esteem when she could nolonger hope to be benefited by it she wanted to hear of him when thereseemed the least chance of gaining intelligence she was convinced thatshe could have been happy with him when it was no longer likely theyshould meetwhat a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that theproposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would nowhave been most gladly and gratefully received he was as generous shedoubted not as the most generous of his sex but while he was mortalthere must be a triumphshe began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who indisposition and talents would most suit her his understanding andtemper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes itwas an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her easeand liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improvedand from his judgement information and knowledge of the world shemust have received benefit of greater importancebut no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude whatconnubial felicity really was an union of a different tendency andprecluding the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in theirfamilyhow wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independenceshe could not imagine but how little of permanent happiness couldbelong to a couple who were only brought together because their passionswere stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture                              mr gardiner soon wrote again to his brother to mr bennetsacknowledgments he briefly replied with assurance of his eagerness topromote the welfare of any of his family and concluded with entreatiesthat the subject might never be mentioned to him again the principalpurport of his letter was to inform them that mr wickham had resolvedon quitting the militiait was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon ashis marriage was fixed on and i think you will agree with me inconsidering the removal from that corps as highly advisable both onhis account and my nieces it is mr wickhams intention to go intothe regulars and among his former friends there are still some whoare able and willing to assist him in the army he has the promise of anensigncy in general s regiment now quartered in the north itis an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom hepromises fairly and i hope among different people where they may eachhave a character to preserve they will both be more prudent i havewritten to colonel forster to inform him of our present arrangementsand to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr wickhamin and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment for which ihave pledged myself and will you give yourself the trouble of carryingsimilar assurances to his creditors in meryton of whom i shall subjoina list according to his information he has given in all his debts ihope at least he has not deceived us haggerston has our directionsand all will be completed in a week they will then join his regimentunless they are first invited to longbourn and i understand from mrsgardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before sheleaves the south she is well and begs to be dutifully remembered toyou and her motheryours etce gardinermr bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickhams removalfrom the shire as clearly as mr gardiner could do but mrs bennetwas not so well pleased with it lydias being settled in the northjust when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her companyfor she had by no means given up her plan of their residing inhertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such apity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquaintedwith everybody and had so many favouritesshe is so fond of mrs forster said she it will be quite shockingto send her away and there
