we areall devoted to this cause and today shall see the end the time iscoming for action today this vampire is limit to the powers of manand till sunset he may not change it will take him time to arriveheresee it is twenty minutes past oneand there are yet some timesbefore he can hither come be he never so quick what we must hope foris that my lord arthur and quincey arrive firstabout half an hour after we had received mrs harkers telegram therecame a quiet resolute knock at the hall door it was just an ordinaryknock such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen but it madethe professors heart and mine beat loudly we looked at each other andtogether moved out into the hall we each held ready to use our variousarmamentsthe spiritual in the left hand the mortal in the right vanhelsing pulled back the latch and holding the door half open stoodback having both hands ready for action the gladness of our heartsmust have shown upon our faces when on the step close to the door wesaw lord godalming and quincey morris they came quickly in and closedthe door behind them the former saying as they moved along thehallit is all right we found both places six boxes in each and wedestroyed them alldestroyed asked the professorfor him we were silent for a minute and then quincey saidtheres nothing to do but to wait here if however he doesnt turn upby five oclock we must start off for it wont do to leave mrs harkeralone after sunsethe will be here before long now said van helsing who had beenconsulting his pocketbook nota bene in madams telegram he wentsouth from carfax that means he went to cross the river and he couldonly do so at slack of tide which should be something before oneoclock that he went south has a meaning for us he is as yet onlysuspicious and he went from carfax first to the place where he wouldsuspect interference least you must have been at bermondsey only ashort time before him that he is not here already shows that he went tomile end next this took him some time for he would then have to becarried over the river in some way believe me my friends we shall nothave long to wait now we should have ready some plan of attack so thatwe may throw away no chance hush there is no time now have all yourarms be ready he held up a warning hand as he spoke for we all couldhear a key softly inserted in the lock of the hall doori could not but admire even at such a moment the way in which adominant spirit asserted itself in all our hunting parties andadventures in different parts of the world quincey morris had alwaysbeen the one to arrange the plan of action and arthur and i had beenaccustomed to obey him implicitly now the old habit seemed to berenewed instinctively with a swift glance around the room he at oncelaid out our plan of attack and without speaking a word with agesture placed us each in position van helsing harker and i werejust behind the door so that when it was opened the professor couldguard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the doorgodalming behind and quincey in front stood just out of sight ready tomove in front of the window we waited in a suspense that made theseconds pass with nightmare slowness the slow careful steps came alongthe hall the count was evidently prepared for some surpriseat leasthe feared itsuddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room winning a way pastus before any of us could raise a hand to stay him there was somethingso pantherlike in the movementsomething so unhuman that it seemedto sober us all from the shock of his coming the first to act washarker who with a quick movement threw himself before the doorleading into the room in the front of the house as the count saw us ahorrible sort of snarl passed over his face showing the eyeteeth longand pointed but the evil smile as quickly passed into a cold stare oflionlike disdain his expression again changed as with a singleimpulse we all advanced upon him it was a pity that we had not somebetter organised plan of attack for even at the moment i wondered whatwe were to do i did not myself know whether our lethal weapons wouldavail us anything harker evidently meant to try the matter for he hadready his great kukri knife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him theblow was a powerful one only the diabolical quickness of the countsleap back saved him a second less and the trenchant blade had shornethrough his heart as it was the point just cut the cloth of his coatmaking a wide gap whence a bundle of banknotes and a stream of goldfell out the expression of the counts face was so hellish that for amoment i feared for harker though i saw him throw the terrible knifealoft again for another stroke instinctively i moved forward with aprotective impulse holding the crucifix and wafer in my left hand ifelt a mighty power fly along my arm and it was without surprise that isaw the monster cower back before a similar movement made spontaneouslyby each one of us it would be impossible to describe the expression ofhate and baffled malignityof anger and hellish ragewhich came overthe counts face his waxen hue became greenishyellow by the contrastof his burning eyes and the red scar on the forehead showed on thepallid skin like a palpitating wound the next instant with a sinuousdive he swept under harkers arm ere his blow could fall and graspinga handful of the money from the floor dashed across the room threwhimself at the window amid the crash and glitter of the falling glasshe tumbled into the flagged area below through the sound of theshivering glass i could hear the ting of the gold as some of thesovereigns fell on the flaggingwe ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground he rushing upthe steps crossed the flagged yard and pushed open the stable doorthere he turned and spoke to usyou think to baffle me youwith your pale faces all in a row likesheep in a butchers you shall be sorry yet each one of you you thinkyou have left me without a place to rest but i have more my revenge isjust begun i spread it over centuries and time is on my side yourgirls that you all love are mine already and through them you andothers shall yet be minemy creatures to do my bidding and to be myjackals when i want to feed bah with a contemptuous sneer he passedquickly through the door and we heard the rusty bolt creak as hefastened it behind him a door beyond opened and shut the first of usto speak was the professor as realising the difficulty of followinghim through the stable we moved toward the hallwe have learnt somethingmuch notwithstanding his brave words hefears us he fear time he fear want for if not why he hurry so hisvery tone betray him or my ears deceive why take that money youfollow quick you are hunters of wild beast and understand it so forme i make sure that nothing here may be of use to him if so that hereturn as he spoke he put the money remaining into his pocket tookthe titledeeds in the bundle as harker had left them and swept theremaining things into the open fireplace where he set fire to them witha matchgodalming and morris had rushed out into the yard and harker hadlowered himself from the window to follow the count he had howeverbolted the stable door and by the time they had forced it open therewas no sign of him van helsing and i tried to make inquiry at the backof the house but the mews was deserted and no one had seen him departit was now late in the afternoon and sunset was not far off we had torecognise that our game was up with heavy hearts we agreed with theprofessor when he saidlet us go back to madam minapoor poor dear madam mina all we can dojust now is done and we can there at least protect her but we neednot despair there is but one more earthbox and we must try to findit when that is done all may yet be well i could see that he spoke asbravely as he could to comfort harker the poor fellow was quite brokendown now and again he gave a low groan which he could not suppresshewas thinking of his wifewith sad hearts we came back to my house where we found mrs harkerwaiting us with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honour to herbravery and unselfishness when she saw our faces her own became aspale as death for a second or two her eyes were closed as if she werein secret prayer and then she said cheerfullyi can never thank you all enough oh my poor darling as she spokeshe took her husbands grey head in her hands and kissed itlay yourpoor head here and rest it all will yet be well dear god will protectus if he so will it in his good intent the poor fellow groaned therewas no place for words in his sublime miserywe had a sort of perfunctory supper together and i think it cheered usall up somewhat it was perhaps the mere animal heat of food to hungrypeoplefor none of us had eaten anything since breakfastor the senseof companionship may have helped us but anyhow we were all lessmiserable and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope true toour promise we told mrs harker everything which had passed andalthough she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed tothreaten her husband and red at others when his devotion to her wasmanifested she listened bravely and with calmness when we came to thepart where harker had rushed at the count so recklessly she clung toher husbands arm and held it tight as though her clinging couldprotect him from any harm that might come she said nothing howevertill the narration was all done and matters had been brought right upto the present time then without letting go her husbands hand shestood up amongst us and spoke oh that i could give any idea of thescene of that sweet sweet good good woman in all the radiant beautyof her youth and animation with the red scar on her forehead of whichshe was conscious and which we saw with grinding of ourteethremembering whence and how it came her loving kindness againstour grim hate her tender faith against all our fears and doubting andwe knowing that so far as symbols went she with all her goodness andpurity and faith was outcast from godjonathan she said and the word sounded like music on her lips it wasso full of love and tenderness jonathan dear and you all my truetrue friends i want you to bear something in mind through all thisdreadful time i know that you must fightthat you must destroy even asyou destroyed the false lucy so that the true lucy might live hereafterbut it is not a work of hate that poor soul who has wrought all thismisery is the saddest case of all just think what will be his joy whenhe too is destroyed in his worser part that his better part may havespiritual immortality you must be pitiful to him too though it maynot hold your hands from his destructionas she spoke i could see her husbands face darken and draw together asthough the passion in him were shrivelling his being to its coreinstinctively the clasp on his wifes hand grew closer till hisknuckles looked white she did not flinch from the pain which i knew shemust have suffered but looked at him with eyes that were more appealingthan ever as she stopped speaking he leaped to his feet almost tearinghis hand from hers as he spokemay god give him into my hand just for long enough to destroy thatearthly life of him which we are aiming at if beyond it i could sendhis soul for ever and ever to burning hell i would do itoh hush oh hush in the name of the good god dont say such thingsjonathan my husband or you will crush me with fear and horror justthink my deari have been thinking all this long long day of itthat perhaps  some day  i too may need such pity and that someother like youand with equal cause for angermay deny it to me ohmy husband my husband indeed i would have spared you such a thoughthad there been another way but i pray that god may not have treasuredyour wild words except as the heartbroken wail of a very loving andsorely stricken man oh god let these poor white hairs go in evidenceof what he has suffered who all his life has done no wrong and on whomso many sorrows have comewe men were all in tears now there was no resisting them and we weptopenly she wept too to see that her sweeter counsels had prevailedher husband flung himself on his knees beside her and putting his armsround her hid his face in the folds of her dress van helsing beckonedto us and we stole out of the room leaving the two loving hearts alonewith their godbefore they retired the professor fixed up the room against any comingof the vampire and assured mrs harker that she might rest in peaceshe tried to school herself to the belief and manifestly for herhusbands sake tried to seem content it was a brave struggle and wasi think and believe not without its reward van helsing had placed athand a bell which either of them was to sound in case of any emergencywhen they had retired quincey godalming and i arranged that we shouldsit up dividing the night between us and watch over the safety of thepoor stricken lady the first watch falls to quincey so the rest of usshall be off to bed as soon as we can godalming has already turned infor his is the second watch now that my work is done i too shall goto bedjonathan harkers journal october close to midnighti thought yesterday would never endthere was over me a yearning for sleep in some sort of blind beliefthat to wake would be to find things changed and that any change mustnow be for the better before we parted we discussed what our next stepwas to be but we could arrive at no result all we knew was that oneearthbox remained and that the count alone knew where it was if hechooses to lie hidden he may baffle us for years and in themeantimethe thought is too horrible i dare not think of it even nowthis i know that if ever there was a woman who was all perfection thatone is my poor wronged darling i love her a thousand times more for hersweet pity of last night a pity that made my own hate of the monsterseem despicable surely god will not permit the world to be the poorerby the loss of such a creature this is hope to me we are all driftingreefwards now and faith is our only anchor thank god mina issleeping and sleeping without dreams i fear what her dreams might belike with such terrible memories to ground them in she has not been socalm within my seeing since the sunset then for a while there cameover her face a repose which was like spring after the blasts of marchi thought at the time that it was the softness of the red sunset on herface but somehow now i think it has a deeper meaning i am not sleepymyself though i am wearyweary to death however i must try to sleepfor there is tomorrow to think of and there is no rest for meuntil                                   lateri must have fallen asleep for i was awaked by mina who wassitting up in bed with a startled look on her face i could see easilyfor we did not leave the room in darkness she had placed a warning handover my mouth and now she whispered in my earhush there is someone in the corridor i got up softly and crossingthe room gently opened the doorjust outside stretched on a mattress lay mr morris wide awake heraised a warning hand for silence as he whispered to mehush go back to bed it is all right one of us will be here allnight we dont mean to take any chanceshis look and gesture forbade discussion so i came back and told minashe sighed and positively a shadow of a smile stole over her poor paleface as she put her arms round me and said softlyoh thank god for good brave men with a sigh she sank back again tosleep i write this now as i am not sleepy though i must try again                                    october morningonce again during the night i was wakened bymina this time we had all had a good sleep for the grey of the comingdawn was making the windows into sharp oblongs and the gas flame waslike a speck rather than a disc of light she said to me hurriedlygo call the professor i want to see him at oncewhy i askedi have an idea i suppose it must have come in the night and maturedwithout my knowing it he must hypnotise me before the dawn and then ishall be able to speak go quick dearest the time is getting close iwent to the door dr seward was resting on the mattress and seeingme he sprang to his feetis anything wrong he asked in alarmno i replied but mina wants to see dr van helsing at oncei will go he said and hurried into the professors roomin two or three minutes later van helsing was in the room in hisdressinggown and mr morris and lord godalming were with dr seward atthe door asking questions when the professor saw mina a smileapositive smile ousted the anxiety of his face he rubbed his hands as hesaidoh my dear madam mina this is indeed a change see friend jonathanwe have got our dear madam mina as of old back to us today thenturning to her he said cheerfully and what am i do for you for atthis hour you do not want me for nothingsi want you to hypnotise me she said do it before the dawn for ifeel that then i can speak and speak freely be quick for the time isshort without a word he motioned her to sit up in bedlooking fixedly at her he commenced to make passes in front of herfrom over the top of her head downward with each hand in turn minagazed at him fixedly for a few minutes during which my own heart beatlike a trip hammer for i felt that some crisis was at hand graduallyher eyes closed and she sat stock still only by the gentle heaving ofher bosom could one know that she was alive the professor made a fewmore passes and then stopped and i could see that his forehead wascovered with great beads of perspiration mina opened her eyes but shedid not seem the same woman there was a faraway look in her eyes andher voice had a sad dreaminess which was new to me raising his hand toimpose silence the professor motioned to me to bring the others inthey came on tiptoe closing the door behind them and stood at thefoot of the bed looking on mina appeared not to see them thestillness was broken by van helsings voice speaking in a low level tonewhich would not break the current of her thoughtswhere are you the answer came in a neutral wayi do not know sleep has no place it can call its own for severalminutes there was silence mina sat rigid and the professor stoodstaring at her fixedly the rest of us hardly dared to breathe the roomwas growing lighter without taking his eyes from minas face dr vanhelsing motioned me to pull up the blind i did so and the day seemedjust upon us a red streak shot up and a rosy light seemed to diffuseitself through the room on the instant the professor spoke againwhere are you now the answer came dreamily but with intention itwere as though she were interpreting something i have heard her use thesame tone when reading her shorthand notesi do not know it is all strange to mewhat do you seei can see nothing it is all darkwhat do you hear i could detect the strain in the professors patientvoicethe lapping of water it is gurgling by and little waves leap i canhear them on the outsidethen you are on a ship we all looked at each other trying to gleansomething each from the other we were afraid to think the answer camequickoh yeswhat else do you hearthe sound of men stamping overhead as they run about there is thecreaking of a chain and the loud tinkle as the check of the capstanfalls into the rachetwhat are you doingi am stilloh so still it is like death the voice faded away intoa deep breath as of one sleeping and the open eyes closed againby this time the sun had risen and we were all in the full light ofday dr van helsing placed his hands on minas shoulders and laid herhead down softly on her pillow she lay like a sleeping child for a fewmoments and then with a long sigh awoke and stared in wonder to seeus all around her have i been talking in my sleep was all she saidshe seemed however to know the situation without telling though shewas eager to know what she had told the professor repeated theconversation and she saidthen there is not a moment to lose it may not be yet too late mrmorris and lord godalming started for the door but the professors calmvoice called them backstay my friends that ship wherever it was was weighing anchorwhilst she spoke there are many ships weighing anchor at the moment inyour so great port of london which of them is it that you seek god bethanked that we have once again a clue though whither it may lead us weknow not we have been blind somewhat blind after the manner of mensince when we can look back we see what we might have seen lookingforward if we had been able to see what we might have seen alas butthat sentence is a puddle is it not we can know now what was in thecounts mind when he seize that money though jonathans so fierceknife put him in the danger that even he dread he meant escape hearme escape he saw that with but one earthbox left and a pack of menfollowing like dogs after a fox this london was no place for

wily andwe must follow with wile i too am wily and i think his mind in alittle while in meantime we may rest and in peace for there are watersbetween us which he do not want to pass and which he could not if hewouldunless the ship were to touch the land and then only at full orslack tide see and the sun is just rose and all day to sunset is tous let us take bath and dress and have breakfast which we all needand which we can eat comfortably since he be not in the same land withus mina looked at him appealingly as she askedbut why need we seek him further when he is gone away from us hetook her

as that god sits on highto watch over his children therefore be of much comfort till we returnvan helsingjonathan harkers journal octoberwhen i read to mina van helsings message in thephonograph the poor girl brightened up considerably already thecertainty that the count is out of the country has given her comfortand comfort is strength to her for my own part now that his horribledanger is not face to face with us it seems almost impossible tobelieve in it even my own terrible experiences in castle dracula seemlike a longforgotten dream here in the crisp autumn air in the brightsunlightalas how can i disbelieve in the midst of my thought my eye fell onthe red scar on my poor darlings white forehead whilst that laststhere can be no disbelief and afterwards the very memory of it willkeep faith crystal clear mina and i fear to be idle so we have beenover all the diaries again and again somehow although the realityseems greater each time the pain and the fear seem less there issomething of a guiding purpose manifest throughout which is comfortingmina says that perhaps we are the instruments of ultimate good it maybe i shall try to think as she does we have never spoken to each otheryet of the future it is better to wait till we see the professor andthe others after their investigationsthe day is running by more quickly than i ever thought a day could runfor me again it is now three oclockmina harkers journal october  p mour meeting for report present professor vanhelsing lord godalming dr seward mr quincey morris jonathanharker mina harkerdr van helsing described what steps were taken during the day todiscover on what boat and whither bound count dracula made his escapeas i knew that he wanted to get back to transylvania i felt sure thathe must go by the danube mouth or by somewhere in the black sea sinceby that way he come it was a dreary blank that was before us omneignotum pro magnifico and so with heavy hearts we start to find whatships leave for the black sea last night he was in sailing ship sincemadam mina tell of sails being set these not so important as to go inyour list of the shipping in the times and so we go by suggestion oflord godalming to your lloyds where are note of all ships that sailhowever so small there we find that only one blackseabound ship goout with the tide she is the czarina catherine and she sail fromdoolittles wharf for varna and thence on to other parts and up thedanube soh said i this is the ship whereon is the count so offwe go to doolittles wharf and there we find a man in an office of woodso small that the man look bigger than the office from him we inquireof the goings of the czarina catherine he swear much and he red faceand loud of voice but he good fellow all the same and when quinceygive him something from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up andput it in a so small bag which he have hid deep in his clothing hestill better fellow and humble servant to us he come with us and askmany men who are rough and hot these be better fellows too when theyhave been no more thirsty they say much of blood and bloom and ofothers which i comprehend not though i guess what they mean butnevertheless they tell us all things which we want to knowthey make known to us among them how last afternoon at about fiveoclock comes a man so hurry a tall man thin and pale with high noseand teeth so white and eyes that seem to be burning that he be all inblack except that he have a hat of straw which suit not him or thetime that he scatter his money in making quick inquiry as to what shipsails for the black sea and for where some took him to the office andthen to the ship where he will not go aboard but halt at shore end ofgangplank and ask that the captain come to him the captain come whentold that he will be pay well and though he swear much at the first heagree to term then the thin man go and some one tell him where horseand cart can be hired he go there and soon he come again himselfdriving cart on which a great box this he himself lift down though ittake several to put it on truck for the ship he give much talk tocaptain as to how and where his box is to be place but the captain likeit not and swear at him in many tongues and tell him that if he like hecan come and see where it shall be but he say no that he come notyet for that he have much to do whereupon the captain tell him that hehad better be quickwith bloodfor that his ship will leave theplaceof bloodbefore the turn of the tidewith blood then the thinman smile and say that of course he must go when he think fit but hewill be surprise if he go quite so soon the captain swear againpolyglot and the thin man make him bow and thank him and say that hewill so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before thesailing final the captain more red than ever and in more tongues tellhim that he doesnt want no frenchmenwith bloom upon them and alsowith bloodin his shipwith blood on her also and so after askingwhere there might be close at hand a ship where he might purchase shipforms he departedno one knew where he went or bloomin well cared as they said forthey had something else to think ofwell with blood again for it soonbecame apparent to all that the czarina catherine would not sail aswas expected a thin mist began to creep up from the river and it grewand grew till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all around herthe captain swore polyglotvery polyglotpolyglot with bloom andblood but he could do nothing the water rose and rose and he began tofear that he would lose the tide altogether he was in no friendly moodwhen just at full tide the thin man came up the gangplank again andasked to see where his box had been stowed then the captain repliedthat he wished that he and his boxold and with much bloom andbloodwere in hell but the thin man did not be offend and went downwith the mate and saw where it was place and came up and stood awhileon deck in fog he must have come off by himself for none notice himindeed they thought not of him for soon the fog begin to melt away andall was clear again my friends of the thirst and the language that wasof bloom and blood laughed as they told how the captains swearsexceeded even his usual polyglot and was more than ever full ofpicturesque when on questioning other mariners who were on movement upand down on the river that hour he found that few of them had seen anyof fog at all except where it lay round the wharf however the shipwent out on the ebb tide and was doubtless by morning far down theriver mouth she was by then when they told us well out to seaand so my dear madam mina it is that we have to rest for a time forour enemy is on the sea with the fog at his command on his way to thedanube mouth to sail a ship takes time go she never so quick and whenwe start we go on land more quick and we meet him there our best hopeis to come on him when in the box between sunrise and sunset for thenhe can make no struggle and we may deal with him as we should thereare days for us in which we can make ready our plan we know all aboutwhere he go for we have seen the owner of the ship who have shown usinvoices and all papers that can be the box we seek is to be landed invarna and to be given to an agent one ristics who will there presenthis credentials and so our merchant friend will have done his partwhen he ask if there be any wrong for that so he can telegraph andhave inquiry made at varna we say no for what is to be done is notfor police or of the customs it must be done by us alone and in our ownwaywhen dr van helsing had done speaking i asked him if he were certainthat the count had remained on board the ship he replied we have thebest proof of that your own evidence when in the hypnotic trance thismorning i asked him again if it were really necessary that they shouldpursue the count for oh i dread jonathan leaving me and i know thathe would surely go if the others went he answered in growing passionat first quietly as he went on however he grew more angry and moreforceful till in the end we could not but see wherein was at least someof that personal dominance which made him so long a master amongstmenyes it is necessarynecessarynecessary for your sake in the firstand then for the sake of humanity this monster has done much harmalready in the narrow scope where he find himself and in the shorttime when as yet he was only as a body groping his so small measure indarkness and not knowing all this have i told these others you mydear madam mina will learn it in the phonograph of my friend john orin that of your husband i have told them how the measure of leaving hisown barren landbarren of peoplesand coming to a new land where lifeof man teems till they are like the multitude of standing corn was thework of centuries were another of the undead like him to try to dowhat he has done perhaps not all the centuries of the world that havebeen or that will be could aid him with this one all the forces ofnature that are occult and deep and strong must have worked together insome wondrous way the very place where he have been alive undead forall these centuries is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemicalworld there are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whitherthere have been volcanoes some of whose openings still send out watersof strange properties and gases that kill or make to vivify doubtlessthere is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations ofoccult forces which work for physical life in strange way and inhimself were from the first some great qualities in a hard and warliketime he was celebrate that he have more iron nerve more subtle brainmore braver heart than any man in him some vital principle have instrange way found their utmost and as his body keep strong and grow andthrive so his brain grow too all this without that diabolic aid whichis surely to him for it have to yield to the powers that come fromand are symbolic of good and now this is what he is to us he haveinfect youoh forgive me my dear that i must say such but it is forgood of you that i speak he infect you in such wise that even if he dono more you have only to liveto live in your own old sweet way andso in time death which is of mans common lot and with gods sanctionshall make you like to him this must not be we have sworn togetherthat it must not thus are we ministers of gods own wish that theworld and men for whom his son die will not be given over to monsterswhose very existence would defame him he have allowed us to redeem onesoul already and we go out as the old knights of the cross to redeemmore like them we shall travel towards the sunrise and like them ifwe fall we fall in good cause he paused and i saidbut will not the count take his rebuff wisely since he has been drivenfrom england will he not avoid it as a tiger does the village fromwhich he has been huntedaha he said your simile of the tiger good for me and i shalladopt him your maneater as they of india call the tiger who has oncetasted blood of the human care no more for the other prey but prowlunceasing till he get him this that we hunt from our village is atiger too a maneater and he never cease to prowl nay in himself heis not one to retire and stay afar in his life his living life he goover the turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own ground he bebeaten back but did he stay no he come again and again and againlook at his persistence and endurance with the childbrain that was tohim he have long since conceive the idea of coming to a great city whatdoes he do he find out the place of all the world most of promise forhim then he deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task hefind in

mankind and for thehonour and glory of godafter a general discussion it was determined that for tonight nothingbe definitely settled that we should all sleep on the facts and try tothink out the proper conclusions tomorrow at breakfast we are tomeet again and after making our conclusions known to one another weshall decide on some definite cause of action                                   i feel a wonderful peace and rest tonight it is as if some hauntingpresence were removed from me perhaps my surmise was not finished could not be for i caught sight in themirror of the red mark upon my forehead and i knew that i was stilluncleandr sewards diary octoberwe all rose early and i think that sleep did much foreach and all of us when we met at early breakfast there was moregeneral cheerfulness than any of us had ever expected to experienceagainit is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature letany obstructing cause no matter what be removed in any wayeven bydeathand we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment morethan once as we sat around the table my eyes opened in wonder whetherthe whole of the past days had not been a dream it was only when icaught sight of the red blotch on mrs harkers forehead that i wasbrought back to reality even now when i am gravely revolving thematter it is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all ourtrouble is still existent even mrs harker seems to lose sight of hertrouble for whole spells it is only now and again when somethingrecalls it to her mind that she thinks of her terrible scar we are tomeet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course ofaction i see only one immediate difficulty i know it by instinctrather than reason we shall all have to speak frankly and yet i fearthat in some mysterious way poor mrs harkers tongue is tied i knowthat she forms conclusions of her own and from all that has been i canguess how brilliant and how true they must be but she will not orcannot give them utterance i have mentioned this to van helsing andhe and i are to talk it over when we are alone i suppose it is some ofthat horrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work thecount had his own purposes when he gave her what van helsing called thevampires baptism of blood well there may be a poison that distilsitself out of good things in an age when the existence of ptomaines isa mystery we should not wonder at anything one thing i know that if myinstinct be true regarding poor mrs harkers silences then there is aterrible difficultyan unknown dangerin the work before us the samepower that compels her silence may compel her speech i dare not thinkfurther for so i should in my thoughts dishonour a noble womanvan helsing is coming to my study a little before the others i shalltry to open the subject with him                                   laterwhen the professor came in we talked over the state ofthings i could see that he had something on his mind which he wanted tosay but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject after beatingabout the bush a little he said suddenlyfriend john there is something that you and i must talk of alone justat the first at any rate later we may have to take the others into ourconfidence then he stopped so i waited he went onmadam mina our poor dear madam mina is changing a cold shiver ranthrough me to find my worst fears thus endorsed van helsingcontinuedwith the sad experience of miss lucy we must this time be warnedbefore things go too far our task is now in reality more difficult thanever and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance ican see the characteristics of the vampire coming in her face it is nowbut very very slight but it is to be seen if we have eyes to noticewithout to prejudge her teeth are some sharper and at times her eyesare more hard but these are not all there is to her the silence nowoften as so it was with miss lucy she did not speak even when shewrote that which she wished to be known later now my fear is this ifit be that she can by our hypnotic trance tell what the count see andhear is it not more true that he who have hypnotise her first and whohave drink of her very blood and make her drink of his should if hewill compel her mind to disclose to him that which she know i noddedacquiescence he went onthen what we must do is to prevent this we must keep her ignorant ofour intent and so she cannot tell what she know not this is a painfultask oh so painful that it heartbreak me to think of but it must bewhen today we meet i must tell her that for reason which we will notto speak she must not more be of our council but be simply guarded byus he wiped his forehead which had broken out in profuse perspirationat the thought of the pain which he might have to inflict upon the poorsoul already so tortured i knew that it would be some sort of comfortto him if i told him that i also had come to the same conclusion for atany rate it would take away the pain of doubt i told him and theeffect was as i expectedit is now close to the time of our general gathering van helsing hasgone away to prepare for the meeting and his painful part of it ireally believe his purpose is to be able to pray alone                                   laterat the very outset of our meeting a great personal relief wasexperienced by both van helsing and myself mrs harker had sent amessage by her husband to say that she would not join us at present asshe thought it better that we should be free to discuss our movementswithout her presence to embarrass us the professor and i looked at eachother for an instant and somehow we both seemed relieved for my ownpart i thought that if mrs harker realised the danger herself it wasmuch pain as well as much danger averted under the circumstances weagreed by a questioning look and answer with finger on lip topreserve silence in our suspicions until we should have been able toconfer alone again we went at once into our plan of campaign vanhelsing roughly put the facts before us firstthe czarina catherine left the thames yesterday morning it will takeher at the quickest speed she has ever made at least three weeks toreach varna but we can travel overland to the same place in three daysnow if we allow for two days less for the ships voyage owing to suchweather influences as we know that the count can bring to bear and ifwe allow a whole day and night for any delays which may occur to usthen we have a margin of nearly two weeks thus in order to be quitesafe we must leave here on th at latest then we shall at any ratebe in varna a day before the ship arrives and able to make suchpreparations as may be necessary of course we shall all go armedarmedagainst evil things spiritual as well as physical here quincey morrisaddedi understand that the count comes from a wolf country and it may bethat he shall get there before us i propose that we add winchesters toour armament i have a kind of belief in a winchester when there is anytrouble of that sort around do you remember art when we had the packafter us at tobolsk what wouldnt we have given then for a repeaterapiecegood said van helsing winchesters it shall be quinceys head islevel at all times but most so when there is to hunt metaphor be moredishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man in the meantime wecan do nothing here and as i think that varna is not familiar to any ofus why not go there more soon it is as long to wait here as theretonight and tomorrow we can get ready and then if all be well wefour can set out on our journeywe four said harker interrogatively looking from one to another ofusof course answered the professor quickly you must remain to takecare of your so sweet wife harker was silent for awhile and then saidin a hollow voicelet us talk of that part of it in the morning i want to consult withmina i thought that now was the time for van helsing to warn him notto disclose our plans to her but he took no notice i looked at himsignificantly and coughed for answer he put his finger on his lips andturned awayjonathan harkers journal october afternoonfor some time after our meeting this morning icould not think the new phases of things leave my mind in a state ofwonder which allows no room for active thought minas determination notto take any part in the discussion set me thinking and as i could notargue the matter with her i could only guess i am as far as ever froma solution now the way the others received it too puzzled me thelast time we talked of the subject we agreed that there was to be nomore concealment of anything amongst us mina is sleeping now calmlyand sweetly like a little child her lips are curved and her face beamswith happiness thank god there are such moments still for her                                   laterhow strange it all is i sat watching minas happy sleep andcame as near to being happy myself as i suppose i shall ever be as theevening drew on and the earth took its shadows from the sun sinkinglower the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to me all atonce mina opened her eyes and looking at me tenderly saidjonathan i want you to promise me something on your word of honour apromise made to me but made holily in gods hearing and not to bebroken though i should go down on my knees and implore you with bittertears quick you must make it to me at oncemina i said a promise like that i cannot make at once i may haveno right to make itbut dear one she said with such spiritual intensity that her eyeswere like pole stars it is i who wish it and it is not for myselfyou can ask dr van helsing if i am not right if he disagrees you maydo as you will nay more if you all agree later you are absolvedfrom the promisei promise i said and for a moment she looked supremely happy thoughto me all happiness for her was denied by the red scar on her foreheadshe saidpromise me that you will not tell me anything of the plans formed forthe campaign against the count not by word or inference orimplication not at any time whilst this remains to me and shesolemnly pointed to the scar i saw that she was in earnest and saidsolemnlyi promise and as i said it i felt that from that instant a door hadbeen shut between us                                   later midnightmina has been bright and cheerful all the eveningso much so that all the rest seemed to take courage as if infectedsomewhat with her gaiety as a result even i myself felt as if the pallof gloom which weighs us down were somewhat lifted we all retiredearly mina is now sleeping like a little child it is a wonderful thingthat her faculty of sleep remains to her in the midst of her terribletrouble thank god for it for then at least she can forget her careperhaps her example may affect me as her gaiety did tonight i shalltry it oh for a dreamless sleep                                    october morninganother surprise mina woke me early about thesame time as yesterday and asked me to bring dr van helsing i thoughtthat it was another occasion for hypnotism and without question wentfor the professor he had evidently expected some such call for i foundhim dressed in his room his door was ajar so that he could hear theopening of the door of our room he came at once as he passed into theroom he asked mina if the others might come toono she said quite simply it will not be necessary you can tellthem just as well i must go with you on your journeydr van helsing was as startled as i was after a moments pause heaskedbut whyyou must take me with you i am safer with you and you shall be safertoobut why dear madam mina you know that your safety is our solemnestduty we go into danger to which you are or may be more liable thanany of us fromfrom circumstancesthings that have been he pausedembarrassedas she replied she raised her finger and pointed to her foreheadi know that is why i must go i can tell you now whilst the sun iscoming up i may not be able again i know that when the count wills mei must go i know that if he tells me to come in secret i must come bywile by any device to hoodwinkeven jonathan god saw the look thatshe turned on me as she spoke and if there be indeed a recording angelthat look is noted to her everlasting honour i could only clasp herhand i could not speak my emotion was too great for even the relief oftears she went onyou men are brave and strong you are strong in your numbers for youcan defy that which would break down the human endurance of one who hadto guard alone besides i may be of service since you can hypnotise meand so learn that which even i myself do not know dr van helsing saidvery gravelymadam mina you are as always most wise you shall with us come andtogether we shall do that which we go forth to achieve when he hadspoken minas long spell of silence made me look at her she had fallenback on her pillow asleep she did not even wake when i had pulled upthe blind and let in the sunlight which flooded the room van helsingmotioned to me to come with him quietly we went to his room and withina minute lord godalming dr seward and mr morris were with us alsohe told them what mina had said and went onin the morning we shall leave for varna we have now to deal with anew factor madam mina oh but her soul is true it is to her an agonyto tell us so much as she has done but it is most right and we arewarned in time there must be no chance lost and in varna we must beready to act the instant when that ship arriveswhat shall we do exactly asked mr morris laconically the professorpaused before replyingwe shall at the first board that ship then when we have identifiedthe box we shall place a branch of the wild rose on it this we shallfasten for when it is there none can emerge so at least says thesuperstition and to superstition must we trust at the first it wasmans faith in the early and it have its root in faith still thenwhen we get the opportunity that we seek when none are near to see weshall open the box andand all will be welli shall not wait for any opportunity said morris when i see the boxi shall open it and destroy the monster though there were a thousandmen looking on and if i am to be wiped out for it the next moment igrasped his hand instinctively and found it as firm as a piece of steeli think he understood my look i hope he didgood boy said dr van helsing brave boy quincey is all man godbless him for it my child believe me none of us shall lag behind orpause from any fear i do but say what we may dowhat we must do butindeed indeed we cannot say what we shall do there are so many thingswhich may happen and their ways and their ends are so various thatuntil the moment we may not say we shall all be armed in all ways andwhen the time for the end has come our effort shall not be lack nowlet us today put all our affairs in order let all things which touchon others dear to us and who on us depend be complete for none of uscan tell what or when or how the end may be as for me my ownaffairs are regulate and as i have nothing else to do i shall go makearrangements for the travel i shall have all tickets and so forth forour journeythere was nothing further to be said and we parted i shall now settleup all my affairs of earth and be ready for whatever may come                                   laterit is all done my will is made and all complete mina if shesurvive is my sole heir if it should not be so then the others whohave been so good to us shall have remainderit is now drawing towards the sunset minas uneasiness calls myattention to it i am sure that there is something on her mind which thetime of exact sunset will reveal these occasions are becoming harrowingtimes for us all for each sunrise and sunset opens up some newdangersome new pain which however may in gods will be means to agood end i write all these things in the diary since my darling mustnot hear them now but if it may be that she can see them again theyshall be readyshe is calling to me october eveningjonathan harker has asked me to note this as hesays he is hardly equal to the task and he wants an exact record kepti think that none of us were surprised when we were asked to see mrsharker a little before the time of sunset we have of late come tounderstand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedomwhen her old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduingor restraining her or inciting her to action this mood or conditionbegins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset and laststill either the sun is high or whilst the clouds are still aglow withthe rays streaming above the horizon at first there is a sort ofnegative condition as if some tie were loosened and then the absolutefreedom quickly follows when however the freedom ceases thechangeback or relapse comes quickly preceded only by a spell ofwarning silencetonight when we met she was somewhat constrained and bore all thesigns of an internal struggle i put it down myself to her making aviolent effort at the earliest instant she could do so a very fewminutes however gave her complete control of herself then motioningher husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she was half recliningshe made the rest of us bring chairs up close taking her husbands handin hers beganwe are all here together in freedom for perhaps the last time i knowdear i know that you will always be with me to the end this was toher husband whose hand had as we could see tightened upon hers inthe morning we go out upon our task and god alone knows what may be instore for any of us you are going to be so good to me as to take mewith you i know that all that brave earnest men can do for a poor weakwoman whose soul perhaps is lostno no not yet but is at any rateat stakeyou will do but you must remember that i am not as you arethere is a poison in my blood in my soul which may destroy me whichmust destroy me unless some relief comes to us oh my friends youknow as well as i do that my soul is at stake and though i know thereis one way out for me you must not and i must not take it she lookedappealingly to us all in turn beginning and ending with her husbandwhat is that way asked van helsing in a hoarse voice what is thatway which we must notmay nottakethat i may die now either by my own hand or that of another beforethe greater evil is entirely wrought i know and you know that were ionce dead you could and would set free my immortal spirit even as youdid my poor lucys were death or the fear of death the only thingthat stood in the way i would not shrink to die here now amidst thefriends who love me but death is not all i cannot believe that to diein such a case when there is hope before us and a bitter task to bedone is gods will therefore i on my part give up here thecertainty of eternal rest and go out into the dark where may be theblackest things that the world or the nether world holds we were allsilent for we knew instinctively that this was only a prelude thefaces of the others were set and harkers grew ashen grey perhaps heguessed better than any of us what was coming she continuedthis is what i can give into the hotchpot i could not but note thequaint legal phrase which she used in such a place and with allseriousness what will each of you give your lives i know she wenton quickly that is easy for brave men your lives are gods and youcan give them back to him but what will you give to me she lookedagain questioningly but this time avoided her husbands face quinceyseemed to understand he nodded and her face lit up then i shall tellyou plainly what i want for there must be no doubtful matter in thisconnection between us now you must promise me one and alleven youmy beloved husbandthat should the time come you will kill mewhat is that time the voice was quinceys but it was low andstrainedwhen you shall be convinced that i am so changed that it is better thati die that i may live when i am thus dead in the flesh then you willwithout a moments delay drive a stake through me and cut off my heador do whatever else may be wanting to give me restquincey was the first to rise after the pause he knelt down before herand taking her hand in his said solemnlyim only a rough fellow who hasnt perhaps lived as a man should towin such a distinction but i swear to you by all that i hold sacred anddear that should the time ever come i shall not flinch from the dutythat you have set us and i promise you too that i shall make allcertain for if i am only doubtful i shall take it that the time hascomemy true friend was all she could say amid her fastfalling tears asbending over she kissed his handi swear the same my dear madam mina said van helsingand i said lord godalming each of them in turn kneeling to her totake the oath i followed myself then her husband turned to herwaneyed and with a greenish pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness ofhis hair and askedand must i too make such a promise oh my wifeyou too my dearest she said with infinite yearning of pity in hervoice and eyes you must not shrink you are nearest and dearest andall the world to me our souls are knit into one for all life and alltime think dear that there have been times when brave men have killedtheir wives and their womenkind to keep them from falling into thehands of the enemy their hands did not falter any the more becausethose that they loved implored them to slay them it is mens dutytowards those whom they love in such times of sore trial and oh mydear if it is to be that i must meet death at any hand let it be atthe hand of him that loves me best dr van helsing i have notforgotten your mercy in poor lucys case to him who lovedshe stoppedwith a flying blush and changed her phraseto him who had best rightto give her peace if that time shall come again i look to you to makeit a happy memory of my husbands life that it was his loving hand whichset me free from the awful thrall upon meagain i swear came the professors resonant voice mrs harkersmiled positively smiled as with a sigh of relief she leaned back andsaidand now one word of warning a warning which you must never forgetthis time if it ever come may come quickly and unexpectedly and insuch case you must lose no time in using your opportunity at such atime i myself might benay if the time ever comes shall beleaguedwith your enemy against youone more request she became very solemn as she said this it is notvital and necessary like the other but i want you to do one thing forme if you will we all acquiesced but no one spoke there was no needto speaki want you to read the burial service she was interrupted by a deepgroan from her husband taking his hand in hers she held it over herheart and continued you must read it over me some day whatever maybe the issue of all this fearful state of things it will be a sweetthought to all or some of us you my dearest will i hope read it forthen it will be in your voice in my memory for evercome what maybut oh my dear one he pleaded death is afar off from younay she said holding up a warning hand i am deeper in death atthis moment than if the weight of an earthly grave lay heavy upon meoh my wife must i read it he said before he beganit would comfort me my husband was all she said and he began toread when she had got the book readyhow can ihow could any onetell of that strange scene itssolemnity its gloom its sadness its horror and withal itssweetness even a sceptic who can see nothing but a travesty of bittertruth in anything holy or emotional would have been melted to the hearthad he seen that little group of loving and devoted friends kneelinground that stricken and sorrowing lady or heard the tender passion ofher husbands voice as in tones so broken with emotion that often hehad to pause he read the simple and beautiful service from the burialof the dead ii cannot go onwordsandvvoiceffail mme                                   she was right in her instinct strange as it all was bizarre as it mayhereafter seem even to us who felt its potent influence at the time itcomforted us much and the silence which showed mrs harkers comingrelapse from her freedom of soul did not seem so full of despair to anyof us as we had dreadedjonathan harkers journal october varnawe left charing cross on the morning of the thgot to paris the same night and took the places secured for us in theorient express we travelled night and day arriving here at about fiveoclock lord godalming went to the consulate to see if any telegram hadarrived for him whilst the rest of us came on to this hoteltheodessus the journey may have had incidents i was however too eagerto get on to care for them until the czarina catherine comes intoport there will be no interest for me in anything in the wide worldthank god mina is well and looks to be getting stronger her colour iscoming back she sleeps a great deal throughout the journey she sleptnearly all the time before sunrise and sunset however she is verywakeful and alert and it has become a habit for van helsing tohypnotise her at such times at first some effort was needed and hehad to make many passes but now she seems to yield at once as if byhabit and scarcely any action is needed he seems to have power atthese particular moments to simply will and her thoughts obey him healways asks her what she can see and hear she answers to the firstnothing all is dark and to the secondi can hear the waves lapping against the ship and the water rushingby canvas and cordage strain and masts and yards creak the wind ishighi can hear it in the shrouds and the bow throws back the foamit is evident that the czarina catherine is still at sea hastening onher way to varna lord godalming has just returned he had fourtelegrams one each day since we started and all to the same effectthat the czarina catherine had not been reported to lloyds fromanywhere he had arranged before leaving london that his agent shouldsend him every day a telegram saying if the ship had been reported hewas to have a message even if she were not reported so that he might besure that there was a watch being kept at the other end of the wirewe had dinner and went to bed early tomorrow we are to see theviceconsul and to arrange if we can about getting on board the shipas soon as she arrives van helsing says that our chance will be to geton the boat between sunrise and sunset the count even if he takes theform of a bat cannot cross the running water of his own volition andso cannot leave the ship as he dare not change to mans form withoutsuspicionwhich he evidently wishes to avoidhe must remain in thebox if then we can come on board after sunrise he is at our mercyfor we can open the box and make sure of him as we did of poor lucybefore he wakes what mercy he shall get from us will not count formuch we think that we shall not have much trouble with officials or theseamen thank god this is the country where bribery can do anythingand we are well supplied with money we have only to make sure that theship cannot come into port between sunset and sunrise without our beingwarned and we shall be safe judge moneybag will settle this case ithink                                    octoberminas report still the same lapping waves and rushingwater darkness and favouring winds we are evidently in good time andwhen we hear of the czarina catherine we shall be ready as she mustpass the dardanelles we are sure to have some report                                    octobereverything is pretty well fixed now i think to welcomethe count on his return from his tour godalming told the shippers thathe fancied that the box sent aboard might contain something stolen froma friend of his and got a half consent that he might open it at his ownrisk the owner gave him a paper telling the captain to give him everyfacility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship and also asimilar authorisation to his agent at varna we have seen the agent whowas much impressed with godalmings kindly manner to him and we are allsatisfied that whatever he can do to aid our wishes will be done wehave already arranged what to do in case we get the box open if thecount is there van helsing and seward will cut off his head at once anddrive a stake through his heart morris and godalming and i shallprevent interference even if we have to use the arms which we shallhave ready the professor says that if we can so treat the counts bodyit will soon after fall into dust in such case there would be noevidence against us in case any suspicion of murder were aroused buteven if it were not we should stand or fall by our act and perhapssome day this very script may be evidence to come between some of us anda rope for myself i should take the chance only too thankfully if itwere to come we mean to leave no stone unturned to carry out ourintent we have arranged with certain officials that the instant theczarina catherine is seen we are to be informed by a specialmessenger                                    octobera

diary with a pen isirksome to me but van helsing says i must we were all wild withexcitement yesterday when godalming got his telegram from lloyds iknow now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard mrsharker alone of our party did not show any signs of emotion afterall it is not strange that she did not for we took special care not tolet her know anything about it and we all tried not to show anyexcitement when we were in her presence in old days she would i amsure have noticed no matter how we might have tried to conceal it butin this way she is greatly changed during the past three weeks thelethargy grows upon her and though she seems strong and well and isgetting back some of her colour van helsing and i are not satisfied wetalk of her often we have not however said a word to the others itwould break poor harkers heartcertainly his nerveif he knew that wehad even a suspicion on the subject van helsing examines he tells meher teeth very carefully whilst she is in the hypnotic condition forhe says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen there is no activedanger of a change in her if this change should come it would benecessary to take steps we both know what those steps would have tobe though we do not mention our thoughts to each other we shouldneither of us shrink from the taskawful though it be to contemplateeuthanasia is an excellent and a comforting word i am grateful towhoever invented itit is only about  hours sail from the dardanelles to here at therate the czarina catherine has come from london she should thereforearrive some time in the morning but as she cannot possibly get inbefore then we are all about to retire early we shall get up at oneoclock so as to be ready                                    october noonno news yet of the ships arrival mrs harkershypnotic report this morning was the same as usual so it is possiblethat we may get news at any moment we men are all in a fever ofexcitement except harker who is calm his hands are cold as ice andan hour ago i found him whetting the edge of the great ghoorka knifewhich he now always carries with him it will be a bad lookout for thecount if the edge of that kukri ever touches his throat driven bythat stern icecold handvan helsing and i were a little alarmed about mrs harker today aboutnoon she got into a sort of lethargy which we did not like although wekept silence to the others we were neither of us happy about it shehad been restless all the morning so that we were at first glad to knowthat she was sleeping when however her husband mentioned casuallythat she was sleeping so soundly that he could not wake her we went toher room to see for ourselves she was breathing naturally and looked sowell and peaceful that we agreed that the sleep was better for her thananything else poor girl she has so much to forget that it is no wonderthat sleep if it brings oblivion to her does her good                                   laterour opinion was justified for when after a refreshing sleepof some hours she woke up she seemed brighter and better than she hadbeen for days at sunset she made the usual hypnotic report wherever hemay be in the black sea the count is hurrying to his destination tohis doom i trust                                    octoberanother day and no tidings of the czarina catherineshe ought to be here by now that she is still journeying somewhere isapparent for mrs harkers hypnotic report at sunrise was still thesame it is possible that the vessel may be lying by at times for fogsome of the steamers which came in last evening reported patches of fogboth to north and south of the port we must continue our watching asthe ship may now be signalled any moment                                    october noonmost strange no news yet of the ship we wait formrs harker reported last night and this morning as usual lappingwaves and rushing water though she added that the waves were veryfaint the telegrams from london have been the same no furtherreport van helsing is terribly anxious and told me just now that hefears the count is escaping us he added significantlyi did not like that lethargy of madam minas souls and memories can dostrange things during trance i was about to ask him more but harkerjust then came in and he held up a warning hand we must try tonightat sunset to make her speak more fully when in her hypnotic state                                         octobertelegram rufus smith london to lord godalming     care h b m vice consul varna     czarina catherine reported entering galatz at one oclock     todaydr sewards diary octoberwhen the telegram came announcing the arrival in galatz ido not think it was such a shock to any of us as might have beenexpected true we did not know whence or how or when the bolt wouldcome but i think we all expected that something strange would happenthe delay of arrival at varna made us individually satisfied that thingswould not be just as we had expected we only waited to learn where thechange would occur none the less however was it a surprise i supposethat nature works on such a hopeful basis that we believe againstourselves that things will be as they ought to be not as we should knowthat they will be transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels even ifit be a willothewisp to man it was an odd experience and we alltook it differently van helsing raised his hand over his head for amoment as though in remonstrance with the almighty but he said not aword and in a few seconds stood up with his face sternly set lordgodalming grew very pale and sat breathing heavily i was myself halfstunned and looked in wonder at one after another quincey morristightened his belt with that quick movement which i knew so well in ourold wandering days it meant action mrs harker grew ghastly white sothat the scar on her forehead seemed to burn but she folded her handsmeekly and looked up in prayer harker smiledactually smiledthedark bitter smile of one who is without hope but at the same time hisaction belied his words for his hands instinctively sought the hilt ofthe great kukri knife and rested there when does the next train startfor galatz said van helsing to us generallyat  tomorrow morning we all started for the answer came frommrs harkerhow on earth do you know said artyou forgetor perhaps you do not know though jonathan does and sodoes dr van helsingthat i am the train fiend at home in exeter ialways used to make up the timetables so as to be helpful to myhusband i found it so useful sometimes that i always make a study ofthe timetables now i knew that if anything were to take us to castledracula we should go by galatz or at any rate through bucharest so ilearned the times very carefully unhappily there are not many to learnas the only train tomorrow leaves as i saywonderful woman murmured the professorcant we get a special asked lord godalming van helsing shook hishead i fear not this land is very different from yours or mine evenif we did have a special it would probably not arrive as soon as ourregular train moreover we have something to prepare we must thinknow let us organize you friend arthur go to the train and get thetickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning doyou friend jonathan go to the agent of the ship and get from himletters to the agent in galatz with authority to make search the shipjust as it was here morris quincey you see the viceconsul and gethis aid with his fellow in galatz and all he can do to make our waysmooth so that no times be lost when over the danube john will staywith madam mina and me and we shall consult for so if time be long youmay be delayed and it will not matter when the sun set since i am herewith madam to make reportand i said mrs harker brightly and more like her old self than shehad been for many a long day shall try to be of use in all ways andshall think and write for you as i used to do something is shiftingfrom me in some strange way and i feel freer than i have been of latethe three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed torealise the significance of her words but van helsing and i turning toeach other met each a grave and troubled glance we said nothing at thetime howeverwhen the three men had gone out to their tasks van helsing asked mrsharker to look up the copy of the diaries and find him the part ofharkers journal at the castle she went away to get it when the doorwas shut upon her he said to mewe mean the same speak outthere is some change it is a hope that makes me sick for it maydeceive usquite so do you know why i asked her to get the manuscriptno said i unless it was to get an opportunity of seeing me aloneyou are in part right friend john but only in part i want to tellyou something and oh my friend i am taking a greata terribleriskbut i believe it is right in the moment when madam mina said thosewords that arrest both our understanding an inspiration came to me inthe trance of three days ago the count sent her his spirit to read hermind or more like he took her to see him in his earthbox in the shipwith water rushing just as it go free at rise and set of sun he learnthen that we are here for she have more to tell in her open life witheyes to see and ears to hear than he shut as he is in his coffinboxnow he make his most effort to escape us at present he want her nothe is sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his callbut he cut her offtake her as he can do out of his own power thatso she come not to him ah there i have hope that our manbrains thathave been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of god willcome higher than his childbrain that lie in his tomb for centuriesthat grow not yet to our stature and that do only work selfish andtherefore small here comes madam mina not a word to her of her tranceshe know it not and it would overwhelm her and make despair just whenwe want all her hope all her courage when most we want all her greatbrain which is trained like mans brain but is of sweet woman and havea special power which the count give her and which he may not take awayaltogetherthough he think not so hush let me speak and you shalllearn oh john my friend we are in awful straits i fear as i neverfeared before we can only trust the good god silence here she comesi thought that the professor was going to break down and have hystericsjust as he had when lucy died but with a great effort he controlledhimself and was at perfect nervous poise when mrs harker tripped intothe room bright and happylooking and in the doing of work seeminglyforgetful of her misery as she came in she handed a number of sheetsof typewriting to van helsing he looked over them gravely his facebrightening up as he read then holding the pages between his finger andthumb he saidfriend john to you with so much of experience alreadyand you toodear madam mina that are younghere is a lesson do not fear ever tothink a halfthought has been buzzing often in my brain but i fear tolet him loose his wings here now with more knowledge i go back towhere that halfthought come from and i find that he be no halfthoughtat all that be a whole thought though so young that he is not yetstrong to use his little wings nay like the ugly duck of my friendhans andersen he be no duckthought at all but a big swanthought thatsail nobly on big wings when the time come for him to try them see iread here what jonathan have writtenthat other of his race who in a later age again and again broughthis forces over the great river into turkey land who when he wasbeaten back came again and again and again though he had to comealone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughteredsince he knew that he alone could ultimately triumphwhat does this tell us not much no the counts childthought seenothing therefore he speak so free your manthought see nothing mymanthought see nothing till just now no but there comes another wordfrom some one who speak without thought because she too know not whatit meanwhat it might mean just as there are elements which restyet when in natures course they move on their way and
