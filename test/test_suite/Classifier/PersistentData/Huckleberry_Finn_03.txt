and by she dropped on to pap and themurder and then i was pretty willing to let her clatter right along she told about me and tom sawyer finding the six thousand dollars onlyshe got it ten and all about pap and what a hard lot he was and whata hard lot i was and at last she got down to where i was murdered  isayswho done it  weve heard considerable about these goings on down inhookerville but we dont know who twas that killed huck finnwell i reckon theres a right smart chance of people here thatdlike to know who killed him  some think old finn done it himselfnois that somost everybody thought it at first  hell never know how nigh he cometo getting lynched  but before night they changed around and judged itwas done by a runaway nigger named jimwhy hei stopped  i reckoned i better keep still  she run on and nevernoticed i had put in at allthe nigger run off the very night huck finn was killed  so theres areward out for himthree hundred dollars  and theres a reward out forold finn tootwo hundred dollars  you see he come to town themorning after the murder and told about it and was out with em on theferryboat hunt and right away after he up and left  before night theywanted to lynch him but he was gone you see  well next day theyfound out the nigger was gone they found out he hadnt ben seen senceten oclock the night the murder was done  so then they put it on himyou see and while they was full of it next day back comes old finnand went boohooing to judge thatcher to get money to hunt for thenigger all over illinois with the judge gave him some and that eveninghe got drunk and was around till after midnight with a couple of mightyhardlooking strangers and then went off with them  well he haintcome back sence and they aint looking for him back till this thingblows over a little for people thinks now that he killed his boy andfixed things so folks would think robbers done it and then hed gethucks money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit people do say he warnt any too good to do it  oh hes sly i reckon if he dont come back for a year hell be all right  you cant proveanything on him you know everything will be quieted down then andhell walk in hucks money as easy as nothingyes i reckon so m  i dont see nothing in the way of it  haseverybody quit thinking the nigger done itoh no not everybody  a good many thinks he done it  but theyll getthe nigger pretty soon now and maybe they can scare it out of himwhy are they after him yetwell youre innocent aint you  does three hundred dollars layaround every day for people to pick up  some folks think the niggeraint far from here  im one of thembut i haint talked it around  afew days ago i was talking with an old couple that lives next door inthe log shanty and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes tothat island over yonder that they call jacksons island  dont anybodylive there says i no nobody says they  i didnt say any more buti done some thinking  i was pretty near certain id seen smoke overthere about the head of the island a day or two before that so i saysto myself like as not that niggers hiding over there anyway saysi its worth the trouble to give the place a hunt  i haint seen anysmoke sence so i reckon maybe hes gone if it was him but husbandsgoing over to seehim and another man  he was gone up the river but hegot back today and i told him as soon as he got here two hours agoi had got so uneasy i couldnt set still  i had to do something with myhands so i took up a needle off of the table and went to threadingit my hands shook and i was making a bad job of it  when the womanstopped talking i looked up and she was looking at me pretty curiousand smiling a little  i put down the needle and thread and let on tobe interestedand i was tooand saysthree hundred dollars is a power of money  i wish my mother could getit is your husband going over there tonightoh yes  he went uptown with the man i was telling you of to get aboat and see if they could borrow another gun  theyll go over aftermidnightcouldnt they see better if they was to wait till daytimeyes  and couldnt the nigger see better too  after midnight helllikely be asleep and they can slip around through the woods and hunt uphis camp fire all the better for the dark if hes got onei didnt think of thatthe woman kept looking at me pretty curious and i didnt feel a bitcomfortable  pretty soon she sayswhat did you say your name was honeymmary williamssomehow it didnt seem to me that i said it was mary before so i didntlook upseemed to me i said it was sarah so i felt sort of corneredand was afeared maybe i was looking it too  i wished the woman wouldsay something more the longer she set still the uneasier i was  butnow she sayshoney i thought you said it was sarah when you first come inoh yesm i did  sarah mary williams  sarahs my first name  somecalls me sarah some calls me maryoh thats the way of ityesmi was feeling better then but i wished i was out of there anyway  icouldnt look up yetwell the woman fell to talking about how hard times was and how poorthey had to live and how the rats was as free as if they owned theplace and so forth and so on and then i got easy again  she was rightabout the rats youd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the cornerevery little while  she said she had to have things handy to throw atthem when she was alone or they wouldnt give her no peace  she showedme a bar of lead twisted up into a knot and said she was a good shotwith it generly but shed wrenched her arm a day or two ago and didntknow whether she could throw true now  but she watched for a chanceand directly banged away at a rat but she missed him wide and saidouch it hurt her arm so  then she told me to try for the next one i wanted to be getting away before the old man got back but of coursei didnt let on  i got the thing and the first rat that showed hisnose i let drive and if hed a stayed where he was hed a been atolerable sick rat  she said that was firstrate and she reckoned iwould hive the next one  she went and got the lump of lead and fetchedit back and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to helpher with  i held up my two hands and she put the hank over them andwent on talking about her and her husbands matters  but she broke offto saykeep your eye on the rats  you better have the lead in your laphandyso she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment and i clappedmy legs together on it and she went on talking  but only about aminute then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the faceand very pleasant and sayscome now whats your real namewhwhat mumwhats your real name  is it bill or tom or bobor what is iti reckon i shook like a leaf and i didnt know hardly what to do  buti

just make a clean breast and tell her everything but she musntgo back on her promise  then i told her my father and mother was deadand the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirtymile back from the river and he treated me so bad i couldnt stand itno longer he went away to be gone a couple of days and so i took mychance and stole some of his daughters old clothes and cleared out andi had been three nights coming the thirty miles  i traveled nightsand hid daytimes and slept and the bag of bread and meat i carried fromhome lasted me all the way and i had aplenty  i

feetll be in a condition when you get to goshen i reckoni went up the bank about fifty yards and then i doubled on my tracksand slipped back to where my canoe was a good piece below the house  ijumped in and was off in a hurry  i went upstream far enough tomake the head of the island and then started across  i took off thesunbonnet for i didnt want no blinders on then  when i was about themiddle i heard the clock begin to strike so i stops and listens thesound come faint over the water but cleareleven  when i struck thehead of the island i never waited to blow though i was most winded buti shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be and starteda good fire there on a high and dry spotthen i jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place a mile and a halfbelow as hard as i could go  i landed and slopped through the timberand up the ridge and into the cavern  there jim laid sound asleep onthe ground  i roused him out and saysgit up and hump yourself jim  there aint a minute to lose  theyreafter usjim never asked no questions he never said a word but the way heworked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared  bythat time everything we had in the world was on our raft and she wasready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid  weput out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing and didnt show acandle outside after thati took the canoe out from the shore a little piece and took a lookbut if there was a boat around i couldnt see it for stars and shadowsaint good to see by  then we got out the raft and slipped along downin the shade past the foot of the island dead stillnever saying awordit must a been close on to one oclock when we got below the island atlast and the raft did seem to go mighty slow  if a boat was to comealong we was going to take to the canoe and break for the illinoisshore and it was well a boat didnt come for we hadnt ever thought toput the gun in the canoe or a fishingline or anything to eat  wewas in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things  it warntgood judgment to put everything on the raftif the men went to the island i just expect they found the camp fire ibuilt and watched it all night for jim to come  anyways they stayedaway from us and if my building the fire never fooled them it warnt nofault of mine  i played it as low down on them as i couldwhen the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in abig bend on the illinois side and hacked off cottonwood branches withthe hatchet and covered up the raft with them so she looked like therehad been a cavein in the bank there  a towhead is a sandbar that hascottonwoods on it as thick as harrowteethwe had mountains on the missouri shore and heavy timber on the illinoisside and the channel was down the missouri shore at that place so wewarnt afraid of anybody running across us  we laid there all dayand watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the missouri shore andupbound steamboats fight the big river in the middle  i told jim allabout the time i had jabbering with that woman and jim said she wasa smart one and if she was to start after us herself she wouldnt setdown and watch a camp fireno sir shed fetch a dog  well then isaid why couldnt she tell her husband to fetch a dog  jim said hebet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start and hebelieved they must a gone uptown to get a dog and so they lost all thattime or else we wouldnt be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen milebelow the villageno indeedy we would be in that same old town again so i said i didnt care what was the reason they didnt get us as longas they didntwhen it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of thecottonwood thicket and looked up and down and across nothing in sightso jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snugwigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy and to keep the thingsdry jim made a floor for the wigwam and raised it a foot or more abovethe level of the raft so now the blankets and all the traps was out ofreach of steamboat waves  right in the middle of the wigwam we made alayer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it forto hold it to its place this was to build a fire on in sloppy weatheror chilly the wigwam would keep it from being seen  we made an extrasteeringoar too because one of the others might get broke on a snagor something we fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lanternon because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboatcoming downstream to keep from getting run over but we wouldnt haveto light it for upstream boats unless we see we was in what they calla crossing for the river was pretty high yet very low banks beingstill a little under water so upbound boats didnt always run thechannel but hunted easy waterthis second night we run between seven and eight hours with a currentthat was making over four mile an hour  we catched fish and talkedand we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness  it was kind ofsolemn drifting down the big still river laying on our backs lookingup at the stars and we didnt ever feel like talking loud and itwarnt often that we laughedonly a little kind of a low chuckle  wehad mighty good weather as a general thing and nothing ever happened tous at allthat night nor the next nor the nextevery night we passed towns some of them away up on black hillsidesnothing but just a shiny bed of lights not a house could you see  thefifth night we passed st louis and it was like the whole world lit upin st petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousandpeople in st louis but i never believed it till i see that wonderfulspread of lights at two oclock that still night  there warnt a soundthere everybody was asleepevery night now i used to slip ashore towards ten oclock at some littlevillage and buy ten or fifteen cents worth of meal or bacon or otherstuff to eat and sometimes i lifted a chicken that warnt roostingcomfortable and took him along  pap always said take a chicken whenyou get a chance because if you dont want him yourself you can easyfind somebody that does and a good deed aint ever forgot  i never seepap when he didnt want the chicken himself but that is what he used tosay anywaymornings before daylight i slipped into cornfields and borrowed awatermelon or a mushmelon or a punkin or some new corn or things ofthat kind  pap always said it warnt no harm to borrow things if youwas meaning to pay them back some time but the widow said it warntanything but a soft name for stealing and no decent body would do it jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partlyright so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three thingsfrom the list and say we wouldnt borrow them any morethen he reckonedit wouldnt be no harm to borrow the others  so we talked it over allone night drifting along down the river trying to make up our mindswhether to drop the watermelons or the cantelopes or the mushmelonsor what  but towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory andconcluded to drop crabapples and psimmons  we warnt feeling justright before that but it was all comfortable now  i was glad the wayit come out too because crabapples aint ever good and the psimmonswouldnt be ripe for two or three months yetwe shot a waterfowl now and then that got up too early in the morningor didnt go to bed early enough in the evening  take it all round welived pretty highthe fifth night below st louis we had a big storm after midnight witha power of thunder and lightning and the rain poured down in a solidsheet we stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itselfwhen the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river aheadand high rocky bluffs on both sides  by and by says i hello jimlooky yonder it was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock we was drifting straight down for her  the lightning showed her verydistinct  she was leaning over with part of her upper deck abovewater and you could see every little chimblyguy clean and clear and achair by the big bell with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of itwhen the flashes comewell it being away in the night and stormy and all so mysteriouslikei felt just the way any other boy would a felt when i see that wrecklaying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river  iwanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little and see whatthere was there  so i saysles land on her jimbut jim was dead against it at first  he saysi doan want to go fooln long er no wrack  wes doin blame wellen we better let blame well alone as de good book says  like as notdeys a watchman on dat wrackwatchman your grandmother i says there aint nothing to watch butthe texas and the pilothouse and do you reckon anybodys going to reskhis life for a texas and a pilothouse such a night as this whenits likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute  jimcouldnt say nothing to that so he didnt try  and besides i sayswe might borrow something worth having out of the captains stateroom seegars i bet youand cost five cents apiece solid cash  steamboatcaptains is always rich and get sixty dollars a month and they dontcare a cent what a thing costs you know long as they want it  stick acandle in your pocket i cant rest jim till we give her a rummaging do you reckon tom sawyer would ever go by this thing  not for pie hewouldnt hed call it an adventurethats what hed call it and hedland on that wreck if it was his last act  and wouldnt he throw styleinto itwouldnt he spread himself nor nothing  why youd think itwas christopher clumbus discovering kingdomcome  i wish tom sawyerwas herejim he grumbled a little but give in  he said we mustnt talk any morethan we could help and then talk mighty low  the lightning showed usthe wreck again just in time and we fetched the stabboard derrick andmade fast therethe deck was high out here  we went sneaking down the slope of it tolabboard in the dark towards the texas feeling our way slow with ourfeet and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys for it was sodark we couldnt see no sign of them  pretty soon we struck the forwardend of the skylight and clumb on to it and the next step fetched us infront of the captains door which was open and by jimminy away downthrough the texashall we see a light and all in the same second weseem to hear low voices in yonderjim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick and told me to comealong  i says all right and was going to start for the raft but justthen i heard a voice wail out and sayoh please dont boys i swear i wont ever tellanother voice said pretty loudits a lie jim turner  youve acted this way before  you always wantmoren your share of the truck and youve always got it too becauseyouve swore t if you didnt youd tell  but this time youve saidit jest one time too many  youre the meanest treacherousest hound inthis countryby this time jim was gone for the raft  i was just abiling withcuriosity and i says to myself tom sawyer wouldnt back out nowand so i wont either im agoing to see whats going on here  so idropped on my hands and knees in the little passage and crept aftin the dark till there warnt but one stateroom betwixt me and thecrosshall of the texas  then in there i see a man stretched on thefloor and tied hand and foot and two men standing over him and oneof them had a dim lantern in his hand and the other one had a pistol this one kept pointing the pistol at the mans head on the floor andsayingid like to  and i orter tooa mean skunkthe man on the floor would shrivel up and say oh please dont billi haint ever goin to telland every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh andsaydeed you aint  you never said no truer thing n that you betyou and once he said  hear him beg and yit if we hadnt got thebest of him and tied him hed a killed us both  and what for  jistfor nothn jist because we stood on our rightsthats what for  buti lay you aint agoin to threaten nobody any more jim turner  putup that pistol billbill saysi dont want to jake packard  im for killin himand didnt he killold hatfield jist the same wayand dont he deserve itbut i dont want him killed and ive got my reasons for itbless yo heart for them words jake packard  ill never forgit youlongs i live says the man on the floor sort of blubberingpackard didnt take no notice of that but hung up his lantern on a nailand started towards where i was there in the dark and motioned billto come  i crawfished as fast as i could about two yards but the boatslanted so that i couldnt make very good time so to keep from gettingrun over and catched i crawled into a stateroom on the upper side the man came apawing along in the dark and when packard got to mystateroom he saysherecome in hereand in he come and bill after him  but before they got in i was upin the upper berth cornered and sorry i come  then they stood therewith their hands on the ledge of the berth and talked  i couldnt seethem but i could tell where they was by the whisky theyd been having i was glad i didnt drink whisky but it wouldnt made much differenceanyway because most of the time they couldnt a treed me because ididnt breathe  i was too scared  and besides a body couldntbreathe and hear such talk  they talked low and earnest  bill wantedto kill turner  he sayshes said hell tell and he will  if we was to give both our sharesto him now it wouldnt make no difference after the row and the wayweve served him  shores youre born hell turn states evidence nowyou hear me  im for putting him out of his troublessom i says packard very quietblame it id sorter begun to think you wasnt  well then thats allright  les go and do ithold on a minute i haint had my say yit  you listen to meshootings good but theres quieter ways if the things got to bedone but what i say is this  it aint good sense to go courtn aroundafter a halter if you can git at what youre up to in some way thatsjist as good and at the same time dont bring you into no resks  aintthat soyou bet it is  but how you goin to manage it this timewell my idea is this  well rustle around and gather up whateverpickins weve overlooked in the staterooms and shove for shore and hidethe truck then well wait  now i say it aint agoin to be moren twohours befo this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river  seehell be drownded and wont have nobody to blame for it but his ownself  i reckon thats a considerble sight better n killin of him im unfavorable to killin a man as long as you can git aroun it itaint good sense it aint good morals  aint i rightyes i reckn you are  but spose she dont break up and wash offwell we can wait the two hours anyway and see cant weall right then come alongso they started and i lit out all in a cold sweat and scrambledforward it was dark as pitch there but i said in a kind of a coarsewhisper jim and he answered up right at my elbow with a sort of amoan and i saysquick jim it aint no time for fooling around and moaning theres agang of murderers in yonder and if we dont hunt up their boat and sether drifting down the river so these fellows cant get away from thewreck theres one of em going to be in a bad fix  but if we find theirboat we can put all of em in a bad fixfor the sheriff ll get emquickhurry  ill hunt the labboard side you hunt the stabboard youstart at the raft andoh my lordy lordy  raf  dey ain no raf no mo she done brokeloose en gone ien here we iswell i catched my breath and most fainted  shut up on a wreck withsuch a gang as that  but it warnt no time to be sentimentering  wedgot to find that boat nowhad to have it for ourselves  so we wentaquaking and shaking down the stabboard side and slow work it wastooseemed a week before we got to the stern  no sign of a boat  jimsaid he didnt believe he could go any furtherso scared he hadnthardly any strength left he said  but i said come on if we get lefton this wreck we are in a fix sure  so on we prowled again  we struckfor the stern of the texas and found it and then scrabbled alongforwards on the skylight hanging on from shutter to shutter for theedge of the skylight was in the water  when we got pretty close to thecrosshall door there was the skiff sure enough  i could just barelysee her  i felt ever so thankful  in another second i would a beenaboard of her but just then the door opened  one of the men stuck hishead out only about a couple of foot from me and i thought i was gonebut he jerked it in again and saysheave that blame lantern out o sight billhe flung a bag of something into the boat and then got in himself andset down  it was packard  then bill he come out and got in  packardsays in a low voiceall readyshove offi couldnt hardly hang on to the shutters i was so weak  but billsayshold ond you go through himno  didnt youno  so hes got his share o the cash yetwell then come along no use to take truck and leave moneysay wont he suspicion what were up tomaybe he wont  but we got to have it anyway come alongso they got out and went inthe door slammed to because it was on the careened side and in a halfsecond i was in the boat and jim come tumbling after me  i out with myknife and cut the rope and away we wentwe didnt touch an oar and we didnt speak nor whisper nor hardly evenbreathe  we went gliding swift along dead silent past the tip of thepaddlebox and past the stern then in a second or two more we was ahundred yards below the wreck and the darkness soaked her up everylast sign of her and we was safe and knowed itwhen we was three or four hundred yards downstream we see the lanternshow like a little spark at the texas door for a second and we knowedby that that the rascals had missed their boat and was beginning tounderstand that they was in just as much trouble now as jim turner wasthen jim manned the oars and we took out after our raft  now was thefirst time that i begun to worry about the meni reckon i hadnthad time to before  i begun to think how dreadful it was even formurderers to be in such a fix  i says to myself there aint notelling but i might come to be a murderer myself yet and then how wouldi like it  so says i to jimthe first light we see well land a hundred yards below it or aboveit in a place where its a good hidingplace for you and the skiff andthen ill go and fix up some kind of a yarn and get somebody to go forthat gang and get them out of their scrape so they can be hung whentheir time comesbut that idea was a failure for pretty soon it begun to storm againand this time worse than ever  the rain poured down and never a lightshowed everybody in bed i reckon  we boomed along down the riverwatching for lights and watching for our raft  after a long time therain let up but the clouds stayed and the lightning kept whimperingand by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead floating and wemade for itit was the raft and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again  weseen a light now away down to the right on shore  so i said i wouldgo for it the skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stolethere on the wreck  we hustled it on to the raft in a pile and i toldjim to float along down and show a light when he judged he had goneabout two mile and keep it burning till i come then i manned my oarsand shoved for the light  as i got down towards it three or four moreshowedup on a hillside  it was a village  i closed in above the shorelight and laid on my oars and floated  as i went by i see it was alantern hanging on the jackstaff of a doublehull ferryboat  i skimmedaround for the watchman awondering whereabouts he slept and by andby i found him roosting on the bitts forward with his head down betweenhis knees  i gave his shoulder two or three little shoves and begun tocryhe stirred up in a kind of a startlish way but when he see it was onlyme he took a good gap and stretch and then he sayshello whats up  dont cry bub  whats the troublei sayspap and mam and sis andthen i broke down  he saysoh dang it now dont take on so we all has to have our troublesand this n ll come out all right  whats the matter with emtheyretheyreare you the watchman of the boatyes he says kind of prettywellsatisfied like  im the captainand the owner and the mate and the pilot and

imagoing up around the corner here to roust out my engineeri struck for the light but as soon as he turned the corner i went backand got into my skiff and bailed her out and then pulled up shore inthe easy water about six hundred yards and tucked myself in amongsome woodboats for i couldnt rest easy till i could see the ferryboatstart but take it all around i was feeling ruther comfortable onaccounts of taking all this trouble for that gang for not many woulda done it  i wished the widow knowed about it  i judged she would beproud of me for helping these rapscallions because rapscallions anddead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interestinwell before long here comes the wreck dim and dusky sliding alongdown a kind of cold shiver went through me and then i struck out forher  she was very deep and i see in a minute there warnt much chancefor anybody being alive in her  i pulled all around her and hollereda little but there wasnt any answer all dead still  i felt a littlebit heavyhearted about the gang but not much for i reckoned if theycould stand it i couldthen here comes the ferryboat so i shoved for the middle of the riveron a long downstream slant and when i judged i was out of eyereachi laid on my oars and looked back and see her go and smell around thewreck for miss hookers remainders because the captain would know heruncle hornback would want them and then pretty soon the ferryboat giveit up and went for the shore and i laid into my work and went aboomingdown the riverit did seem a powerful long time before jims light showed up and whenit did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off  by the time igot there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east so westruck for an island and hid the raft and sunk the skiff and turnedin and slept like dead peopleby and by when we got up we turned over the truck the gang had stoleoff of the wreck and found boots and blankets and clothes and allsorts of other things and a lot of books and a spyglass and threeboxes of seegars  we hadnt ever been this rich before in neither ofour lives  the seegars was prime  we laid off all the afternoon in thewoods talking and me reading the books and having a general goodtime i told jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at theferryboat and i said these kinds of things was adventures but he saidhe didnt want no more adventures  he said that when i went in thetexas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone henearly died because he judged it was all up with him anyway it couldbe fixed for if he didnt get saved he would get drownded and if hedid get saved whoever saved him would send him back home so as to getthe reward and then miss watson would sell him south sure  well hewas right he was most always right he had an uncommon level head for aniggeri read considerable to jim about kings and dukes and earls and such andhow gaudy they dressed and how much style they put

nigger to argueso i quitwe judged that three nights more would fetch us to cairo at the bottomof illinois where the ohio river comes in and that was what we wasafter  we would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up theohio amongst the free states and then be out of troublewell the second night a fog begun to come on and we made for a towheadto tie to for it wouldnt do to try to run in a fog but when i paddledahead in the canoe with the line to make fast there warnt anythingbut little saplings to tie to  i passed the line around one of themright on the edge of the cut bank but there was a stiff current andthe raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots andaway she went  i see the fog closing down and it made me so sick andscared i couldnt budge for most a half a minute it seemed to meandthen there warnt no raft in sight you couldnt see twenty yards  ijumped into the canoe and run back to the stern and grabbed the paddleand set her back a stroke  but she didnt come  i was in such a hurryi hadnt untied her  i got up and tried to untie her but i was soexcited my hands shook so i couldnt hardly do anything with themas soon as i got started i took out after the raft hot and heavy rightdown the towhead  that was all right as far as it went but the towheadwarnt sixty yards long and the minute i flew by the foot of it i shotout into the solid white fog and hadnt no more idea which way i wasgoing than a dead manthinks i it wont do to paddle first i know ill run into the bankor a towhead or something i got to set still and float and yet itsmighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time i whooped and listened  away down there somewheres i hears a smallwhoop and up comes my spirits  i went tearing after it listeningsharp to hear it again  the next time it come i see i warnt headingfor it but heading away to the right of it  and the next time i washeading away to the left of itand not gaining on it much either fori was flying around this way and that and tother but it was goingstraight ahead all the timei did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan and beat it all thetime but he never did and it was the still places between the whoopsthat was making the trouble for me  well i fought along and directlyi hears the whoop behind me  i was tangled good now  that wassomebody elses whoop or else i was turned aroundi throwed the paddle down  i heard the whoop again it was behind meyet but in a different place it kept coming and kept changing itsplace and i kept answering till by and by it was in front of me againand i knowed the current had swung the canoes head downstream and iwas all right if that was jim and not some other raftsman hollering i couldnt tell nothing about voices in a fog for nothing dont looknatural nor sound natural in a fogthe whooping went on and in about a minute i come abooming down on acut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it and the current throwedme off to the left and shot by amongst a lot of snags that fairlyroared the currrent was tearing by them so swiftin another second or two it was solid white and still again  i setperfectly still then listening to my heart thump and i reckon i didntdraw a breath while it thumped a hundredi just give up then  i knowed what the matter was  that cut bankwas an island and jim had gone down tother side of it  it warnt notowhead that you could float by in ten minutes  it had the big timberof a regular island it might be five or six miles long and more thanhalf a mile widei kept quiet with my ears cocked about fifteen minutes i reckon  iwas floating along of course four or five miles an hour but you dontever think of that  no you feel like you are laying dead still onthe water and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you dont think toyourself how fast youre going but you catch your breath and thinkmy how that snags tearing along  if you think it aint dismal andlonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night you try itonceyoull seenext for about a half an hour i whoops now and then at last i hearsthe answer a long ways off and tries to follow it but i couldnt doit and directly i judged id got into a nest of towheads for i hadlittle dim glimpses of them on both sides of mesometimes just a narrowchannel between and some that i couldnt see i knowed was there becauseid hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trashthat hung over the banks  well i warnt long loosing the whoops downamongst the towheads and i only tried to chase them a little whileanyway because it was worse than chasing a jackolantern  you neverknowed a sound dodge around so and swap places so quick and so muchi had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times tokeep from knocking the islands out of the river and so i judged theraft must be butting into the bank every now and then or else it wouldget further ahead and clear out of hearingit was floating a littlefaster than what i waswell i seemed to be in the open river again by and by but i couldnthear no sign of a whoop nowheres  i reckoned jim had fetched up on asnag maybe and it was all up with him  i was good and tired so ilaid down in the canoe and said i wouldnt bother no more  i didntwant to go to sleep of course but i was so sleepy i couldnt help itso i thought i would take jest one little catnapbut i reckon it was more than a catnap for when i waked up the starswas shining bright the fog was all gone and i was spinning down abig bend stern first  first i didnt know where i was i thought i wasdreaming and when things began to come back to me they seemed to comeup dim out of last weekit was a monstrous big river here with the tallest and the thickestkind of timber on both banks just a solid wall as well as i could seeby the stars  i looked away downstream and seen a black speck on thewater i took after it but when i got to it it warnt nothing but acouple of sawlogs made fast together  then i see another speck andchased that then another and this time i was right  it was the raftwhen i got to it jim was setting there with his head down between hisknees asleep with his right arm hanging over the steeringoar  theother oar was smashed off and the raft was littered up with leaves andbranches and dirt  so shed had a rough timei made fast and laid down under jims nose on the raft and began togap and stretch my fists out against jim and sayshello jim have i been asleep  why didnt you stir me upgoodness gracious is dat you huck  en you ain deadyou aindrowndedyous back

it jimso jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through just asit happened only he painted it up considerable  then he said he muststart in and terpret it because it was sent for a warning  he saidthe first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good butthe current was another man that would get us away from him  the whoopswas warnings that would come to us every now and then and if we didnttry hard to make out to understand them theyd just take us into badluck stead of keeping us out of it  the lot of towheads was troubleswe was going
