to watch out sharp and let him know when themen come in sight again said they was up to some devilment orotherwouldnt be gone long  i wished i was out of that tree but idasnt come down  buck begun to cry and rip and lowed that him andhis cousin joe that was the other young chap would make up for thisday yet  he said his father and his two brothers was killed and twoor three of the enemy  said the shepherdsons laid for them inambush  buck said his father and brothers ought to waited for theirrelationsthe shepherdsons was too strong for them  i asked him whatwas become of young harney and miss sophia  he said theyd got acrossthe river and was safe  i was glad of that but the way buck did takeon because he didnt manage to kill harney that day he shot at himihaint ever heard anything like itall of a sudden bang bang bang goes three or four gunsthe men hadslipped around through the woods and come in from behind without theirhorses  the boys jumped for the riverboth of them hurtand as theyswum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them andsinging out kill them kill them  it made me so sick i most fell outof the tree  i aint agoing to tell all that happenedit would makeme sick again if i was to do that  i wished i hadnt ever come ashorethat night to see such things  i aint ever going to get shut ofthemlots of times i dream about themi stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark afraid to come downsometimes i heard guns away off in the woods and twice i seen littlegangs of men gallop past the log store with guns so i reckoned thetrouble was still agoing on  i was mighty downhearted so i made up mymind i wouldnt ever go anear that house again because i reckoned iwas to blame somehow i judged that that piece of paper meant that misssophia was to meet harney somewheres at halfpast two and run off andi judged i ought to told her father about that paper and the curious wayshe acted and then maybe he would a locked her up and this awful messwouldnt ever happenedwhen i got down out of the tree i crept along down the river bank apiece and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water andtugged at them till i got them ashore then i covered up their facesand got away as quick as i could  i cried a little when i was coveringup bucks face for he was mighty good to meit was just dark now  i never went near the house but struck throughthe woods and made for the swamp  jim warnt on his island so itramped off in a hurry for the crick and crowded through the willowsredhot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country  the raft wasgone  my souls but i was scared  i couldnt get my breath for mosta minute then i raised a yell  a voice not twentyfive foot from mesaysgood lan is dat you honey  doan make no noiseit was jims voicenothing ever sounded so good before  i run along thebank a piece and got aboard and jim he grabbed me and hugged me he wasso glad to see me  he sayslaws bless you chile i uz right down sho yous dead agin  jacksbeen heah he say he reckn yous ben shot kase you didn come home nomo so is jes dis minute a startin de raf down towards de mouf erde crick sos to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as jackcomes agin en tells me for certain you is dead  lawsy is mightyglad to git you back again honeyi saysall rightthats mighty good they wont find me and theyll thinkive been killed and floated down the rivertheres something up therethat ll help them think soso dont you lose no time jim but justshove off for the big water as fast as ever you cani never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out inthe middle of the mississippi  then we hung up our signal lantern andjudged that we was free and safe once more  i hadnt had a bite to eatsince yesterday so jim he got out some corndodgers and buttermilkand pork and cabbage and greensthere aint nothing in the world so goodwhen its cooked rightand whilst i eat my supper we talked and had agood time  i was powerful glad to get away from the feuds and so wasjim to get away from the swamp  we said there warnt no home like araft after all  other places do seem so cramped up and smothery but araft dont  you feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a rafttwo or three days and nights went by i reckon i might say they swum bythey slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely  here is the way we putin the time  it was a monstrous big river down theresometimes a mileand a half wide we run nights and laid up and hid daytimes soon asnight was most gone we stopped navigating and tied upnearly alwaysin the dead water under a towhead and then cut young cottonwoods andwillows and hid the raft with them  then we set out the lines  nextwe slid into the river and had a swim so as to freshen up and cooloff then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about kneedeep and watched the daylight come  not a sound anywheresperfectlystilljust like the whole world was asleep only sometimes the bullfrogsacluttering maybe  the first thing to see looking away over thewater was a kind of dull linethat was the woods on tother side youcouldnt make nothing else out then a pale place in the sky then morepaleness spreading around then the river softened up away off andwarnt black any more but gray you could see little dark spotsdrifting along ever so far awaytrading scows and such things andlong black streaksrafts sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking orjumbled up voices it was so still and sounds come so far and by andby you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of thestreak that theres a snag there in a swift current which breaks on itand makes that streak look that way and you see the mist curl up offof the water and the east reddens up and the river and you make out alogcabin in the edge of the woods away on the bank on tother side ofthe river being a woodyard likely and piled by them cheats so you canthrow a dog through it anywheres then the nice breeze springs up andcomes fanning you from over there so cool and fresh and sweet to smellon account of the woods and the flowers but sometimes not that waybecause theyve left dead fish laying around gars and such and theydo get pretty rank and next youve got the full day and everythingsmiling in the sun and the songbirds just going ita little smoke couldnt be noticed now so we would take some fish offof the lines and cook up a hot breakfast  and afterwards we would watchthe lonesomeness of the river and kind of lazy along and by and bylazy off to sleep  wake up by and by and look to see what done it andmaybe see a steamboat coughing along upstream so far off towards theother side you couldnt tell nothing about her only whether she wasa sternwheel or sidewheel then for about an hour there wouldnt benothing to hear nor nothing to seejust solid lonesomeness  nextyoud see a raft sliding by away off yonder and maybe a galoot on itchopping because theyre most always doing it on a raft youd see theaxe flash and come downyou dont hear nothing you see that axe goup again and by the time its above the mans head then you hear thekchunkit had took all that time to come over the water  so wewould put in the day lazying around listening to the stillness  oncethere was a thick fog and the rafts and things that went by was beatingtin pans so the steamboats wouldnt run over them  a scow or araft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing andlaughingheard them plain but we couldnt see no sign of them it madeyou feel crawly it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air jim said he believed it was spirits but i saysno spirits wouldnt say dern the dern fogsoon as it was night out we shoved when we got her out to about themiddle we let her alone and let her float wherever the current wantedher to then we lit the pipes and dangled our legs in the water andtalked about all kinds of thingswe was always naked day and nightwhenever the mosquitoes would let usthe new clothes bucks folks madefor me was too good to be comfortable and besides i didnt go much onclothes nohowsometimes wed have that whole river all to ourselves for the longesttime yonder was the banks and the islands across the water and maybea sparkwhich was a candle in a cabin window and sometimes on the wateryou could see a spark or twoon a raft or a scow you know and maybeyou could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them craftsits lovely to live on a raft  we had the sky up there all speckledwith stars and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them anddiscuss about whether they was made or only just happened  jim heallowed they was made but i allowed they happened i judged it wouldhave took too long to make so many  jim said the moon could a laidthem well that looked kind of reasonable so i didnt say nothingagainst it because ive seen a frog lay most as many so of course itcould be done we used to watch the stars that fell too and see themstreak down  jim allowed theyd got spoiled and was hove out of thenestonce or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in thedark and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up outof her chimbleys and they would rain down in the river and look awfulpretty then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out andher powwow shut off and leave the river still again and by and by herwaves would get to us a long time after she was gone and joggle theraft a bit and after that you wouldnt hear nothing for you couldnttell how long except maybe frogs or somethingafter midnight the people on shore went to bed and then for two orthree hours the shores was blackno more sparks in the cabin windows these sparks was our clockthe first one that showed again meantmorning was coming so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right awayone morning about daybreak i found a canoe and crossed over a chute tothe main shoreit was only two hundred yardsand paddled about a mileup a crick amongst the cypress woods to see if i couldnt get someberries just as i was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossedthe crick here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight asthey could foot it  i thought i was a goner for whenever anybody wasafter anybody i judged it was meor maybe jim  i was about to dig outfrom there in a hurry but they was pretty close to me then and sungout and begged me to save their livessaid they hadnt been doingnothing and was being chased for itsaid there was men and dogsacoming  they wanted to jump right in but i saysdont you do it  i dont hear the dogs and horses yet youve got timeto crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways then youtake to the water and wade down to me and get inthatll throw the dogsoff the scentthey done it and soon as they was aboard i lit out for our towheadand in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away offshouting we heard them come along towards the crick but couldntsee them they seemed to stop and fool around a while then as we gotfurther and further away all the time we couldnt hardly hear them atall by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck theriver everything was quiet and we paddled over to the towhead and hidin the cottonwoods and was safeone of these fellows was about seventy or upwards and had a bald headand very gray whiskers  he had an old batteredup slouch hat on anda greasy blue woollen shirt and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffedinto his boottops and homeknit gallusesno he only had one  he hadan old longtailed blue

ever so much and so did i we tried to comfort him buthe said it warnt much use he couldnt be much comforted said if wewas a mind to acknowledge him that would do him more good than mostanything else so we said we would if he would tell us how  he said weought to bow when we spoke to him and say your grace or my lord or your lordshipand he wouldnt mind it if we called him plainbridgewater which he said was a title anyway and not a name andone of us ought to wait on him at dinner and do any little thing forhim he wanted donewell that was all easy so we done it  all through dinner jim stoodaround and waited on him and says will yo grace have some o dis orsome o dat and so on and a body could see it was mighty pleasing tohimbut the old man got pretty silent by and bydidnt have much to say anddidnt look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going onaround that duke  he seemed to have something on his mind  so alongin the afternoon he sayslooky here bilgewater he says im

misery the wanderin exiledtrampledon and sufferin rightful king of francewell he cried and took on so that me and jim didnt know hardly what todo we was so sorryand so glad and proud wed got him with us too so we set in like we done before with the duke and tried to comforthim but he said it warnt no use nothing but to be dead and donewith it all could do him any good though he said it often made him feeleasier and better for a while if people treated him according to hisrights and got down on one knee to speak to him and always called himyour majesty and waited on him first at meals and didnt set downin his presence till he asked them so jim and me set to majestying himand doing this and that and tother for him and standing up till hetold us we might set down  this done him heaps of good and so hegot cheerful and comfortable  but the duke kind of soured on him anddidnt look a bit satisfied with the way things was going stillthe king acted real friendly towards him and said the dukesgreatgrandfather and all the other dukes of bilgewater was a gooddeal thought of by his father and was allowed to come to the palaceconsiderable but the duke stayed huffy a good while till by and by theking sayslike as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this hyerraft bilgewater and so whats the use o your bein sour  it ll onlymake things oncomfortable  it aint my fault i warnt born a dukeit aint your fault you warnt born a kingso whats the use to worry make the best o things the way you find em says ithats my motto this aint no bad thing that weve struck hereplenty grub and an easylifecome give us your hand duke and les all be friendsthe duke done it and jim and me was pretty glad to see it  it tookaway all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it becauseit would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on theraft for what you want above all things on a raft is for everybodyto be satisfied and feel right and kind towards the othersit didnt take me long to make up my mind that these liars warnt nokings nor dukes at all but just lowdown humbugs and frauds  but inever said nothing never let on kept it to myself its the best waythen you dont have no quarrels and dont get into no trouble  if theywanted us to call them kings and dukes i hadnt no objections long asit would keep peace in the family and it warnt no use to tell jim soi didnt tell him  if i never learnt nothing else out of pap i learntthat the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let themhave their own waythey asked us considerable many questions wanted to know what wecovered up the raft that way for and laid by in the daytime instead ofrunningwas jim a runaway nigger  says igoodness sakes would a runaway nigger run southno they allowed he wouldnt  i had to account for things some way soi saysmy folks was living in pike county in missouri where i was born andthey all died off but me and pa and my brother ike  pa he lowedhed break up and go down and live with uncle ben whos got a littleonehorse place on the river fortyfour mile below orleans  pa waspretty poor and had some debts so when hed squared up there warntnothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger jim  that warntenough to take us fourteen hundred mile deck passage nor no other way well when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day he ketchedthis piece of a raft so we reckoned wed go down to orleans on it pas luck didnt hold out a steamboat run over the forrard corner ofthe raft one night and we all went overboard and dove under the wheeljim and me come up all right but pa was drunk and ike was only fouryears old so they never come up no more  well for the next day ortwo we had considerable trouble because people was always coming out inskiffs and trying to take jim away from me saying they believed he wasa runaway nigger  we dont run daytimes no more now nights they dontbother usthe duke saysleave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if wewant to  ill think the thing overill invent a plan thatll fix itwell let it alone for today because of course we dont want to go bythat town yonder in daylightit mightnt be healthytowards night it begun to darken up and look like rain the heatlightning was squirting around low down in the sky and the leaves wasbeginning to shiverit was going to be pretty ugly it was easy to seethat  so the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam to seewhat the beds was like  my bed was a straw tick better than jimswhich was a cornshuck tick theres always cobs around about in a shucktick and they poke into you and hurt and when you roll over the dryshucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves itmakes such a rustling that you wake up  well the duke allowed he wouldtake my bed but the king allowed he wouldnt  he saysi should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you thata cornshuck bed warnt just fitten for me to sleep on  your grace lltake the shuck bed yourselfjim and me was in a sweat again for a minute being afraid there wasgoing to be some more trouble amongst them so we was pretty glad whenthe duke saystis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel ofoppression  misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit i yield isubmit tis my fate  i am alone in the worldlet me suffer can bearitwe got away as soon as it was good and dark  the king told us to standwell out towards the middle of the river and not show a light till wegot a long ways below the town  we come in sight of the little bunch oflights by and bythat was the town you knowand slid by about a halfa mile out all right  when we was threequarters of a mile below wehoisted up our signal lantern and about ten oclock it come on to rainand blow and thunder and lighten like everything so the king told usto both stay on watch till the weather got better then him and the dukecrawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night  it was my watchbelow till twelve but i wouldnt a turned in anyway if id had a bedbecause a body dont see such a storm as that every day in the week notby a long sight  my souls how the wind did scream along  and everysecond or two thered come a glare that lit up the whitecaps for a halfa mile around and youd see the islands looking dusty through the rainand the trees thrashing around in the wind then comes a hwhackbumbum bumbleumbleumbumbumbumbumand the thunder would go rumblingand grumbling away and quitand then rip comes another flash andanother sockdolager  the waves most washed me off the raft sometimesbut i hadnt any clothes on and didnt mind  we didnt have no troubleabout snags the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constantthat we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way orthat and miss themi had the middle watch you know but i was pretty sleepy by that timeso jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me he was alwaysmighty good that way jim was  i crawled into the wigwam but the kingand the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warnt no show forme so i laid outsidei didnt mind the rain because it was warm andthe waves warnt running so high now  about two they come up againthough and jim was going to call me but he changed his mind becausehe reckoned they warnt high enough yet to do any harm but he wasmistaken about that for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes aregular ripper and washed me overboard  it most killed jim alaughing he was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was anywayi took the watch and jim he laid down and snored away and by and bythe storm let up for good and all and the first cabinlight that showedi rousted him out and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for thedaythe king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast and himand the duke played sevenup a while five cents a game  then they gottired of it and allowed they would lay out a campaign as they calledit the duke went down into his carpetbag and fetched up a lot oflittle printed bills and read them out loud  one bill said thecelebrated dr armand de montalban of paris would lecture on thescience of phrenology at such and such a place on the blank day ofblank at ten cents admission and furnish charts of character attwentyfive cents apiece  the duke said that was him  in anotherbill he was the worldrenowned shakespearian tragedian garrick theyounger of drury lane london  in other bills he had a lot of othernames and done other wonderful things like finding water and gold witha diviningrod dissipating witch spells and so on  by and by hesaysbut the histrionic muse is the darling  have you ever trod the boardsroyaltyno says the kingyou shall then before youre three days older fallen grandeur saysthe duke  the first good town we come to well hire a hall and do thesword fight in richard iii and the balcony scene in romeo and juliethow does that strike youim in up to the hub for anything that will pay bilgewater but yousee i dont know nothing about playactin and haint ever seen muchof it  i was too small when pap used to have em at the palace  do youreckon you can learn meeasyall right  im jist afreezn for something fresh anyway  lescommence right awayso the duke he told him all about who romeo was and who juliet was andsaid he was used to being romeo so the king could be julietbut if juliets such a young gal duke my peeled head and my whitewhiskers is goin to look oncommon odd on her maybeno dont you worry these country jakes wont ever think of thatbesides you know youll be in costume and that makes all thedifference in the world juliets in a balcony enjoying the moonlightbefore she goes to bed and shes got on her nightgown and her rufflednightcap  here are the costumes for the partshe got out two or three curtaincalico suits which he said wasmeedyevil armor for richard iii and tother chap and a long whitecotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match  the king wassatisfied so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in themost splendid spreadeagle way prancing around and acting at the sametime to show how it had got to be done then he give the book to theking and told him to get his part by heartthere was a little onehorse town about three mile down the bend andafter dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to runin daylight without it being dangersome for jim so he allowed he wouldgo down to the town and fix that thing  the king allowed he would gotoo and see if he couldnt strike something  we was out of coffee sojim said i better go along with them in the canoe and get somewhen we got there there warnt nobody stirring streets empty andperfectly dead and still like sunday  we found a sick nigger sunninghimself in a back yard and he said everybody that warnt too young ortoo sick or too old was gone to campmeeting about two mile back in thewoods  the king got the directions and allowed hed go and work thatcampmeeting for all it was worth and i might go toothe duke said what he was after was a printingoffice  we found ita little bit of a concern up over a carpenter shopcarpenters andprinters all gone to the meeting and no doors locked  it was a dirtylitteredup place and had ink marks and handbills with pictures ofhorses and runaway niggers on them all over the walls  the duke shedhis coat and said he was all right now  so me and the king lit out forthe campmeetingwe got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping for it was a mostawful hot day  there was as much as a thousand people there fromtwenty mile around  the woods was full of teams and wagons hitchedeverywheres feeding out of the wagontroughs and stomping to keepoff the flies  there was sheds made out of poles and roofed over withbranches where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell and piles ofwatermelons and green corn and suchlike truckthe preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds only they wasbigger and held crowds of people  the benches was made out of outsideslabs of logs with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks intofor legs they didnt have no backs  the preachers had high platformsto stand on at one end of the sheds  the women had on sunbonnetsand some had linseywoolsey frocks some gingham ones and a few of theyoung ones had on calico  some of the young men was barefooted andsome of the children didnt have on any clothes but just a towlinenshirt  some of the old women was knitting and some of the young folkswas courting on the slythe first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn  he linedout two lines everybody sung it and it was kind of grand to hear itthere was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way thenhe lined out two more for them to singand so on  the people woke upmore and more and sung louder and louder and towards the end somebegun to groan and some begun to shout  then the preacher begun topreach and begun in earnest too and went weaving first to one side ofthe platform and then the other and then aleaning down over the frontof it with his arms and his body going all the time and shouting hiswords out with all his might and every now and then he would hold uphis bible and spread it open and kind of pass it around this way andthat shouting its the brazen serpent in the wilderness  look uponit and live  and people would shout out gloryaamen  and sohe went on and the people groaning and crying and saying amenoh come to the mourners bench come black with sin amen comesick and sore amen come lame and halt and blind amen comepore and needy sunk in shame aamen come all thats worn andsoiled and sufferingcome with a broken spirit come with a contriteheart come in your rags and sin and dirt the waters that cleanseis free the door of heaven stands openoh enter in and be at rest aamen  glory glory hallelujahand so on  you couldnt make out what the preacher said any more onaccount of the shouting and crying  folks got up everywheres in thecrowd and worked their way just by main strength to the mournersbench with the tears running down their faces and when all themourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd they sung andshouted and flung themselves down on the straw just crazy and wildwell the first i knowed the king got agoing and you could hear himover everybody and next he went acharging up on to the platform andthe preacher he begged him to speak to the people and he done it  hetold them he was a piratebeen a pirate for thirty years out in theindian oceanand his crew was thinned out considerable last spring ina fight and he was home now to take out some fresh men and thanks togoodness hed been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboatwithout a cent and he was glad of it it was the blessedest thing thatever happened to him because he was a changed man now and happy forthe first time in his life and poor as he was he was going to startright off and work his way back to the indian ocean and put in the restof his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path for he coulddo it better than anybody else being acquainted with all pirate crewsin that ocean and though it would take him a long time to get therewithout money he would get there anyway and every time he convinceda pirate he would say to him dont you thank me dont you give me nocredit it all belongs to them dear people in pokeville campmeetingnatural brothers and benefactors of the race and that dear preacherthere the truest friend a pirate ever hadand then he busted into tears and so did everybody  then somebodysings out take up a collection for him take up a collection  wella half a dozen made a jump to do it but somebody sings out let himpass the hat around  then everybody said it the preacher tooso the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyesand blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for beingso good to the poor pirates away off there and every little while theprettiest kind of girls with the tears running down their cheeks wouldup and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by and healways done it and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five orsix timesand he was invited to stay a week and everybody wanted him tolive in their houses and said theyd think it was an honor but he saidas this was the last day of the campmeeting he couldnt do no good andbesides he was in a sweat to get to the indian ocean right off and go towork on the pirateswhen we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he hadcollected eightyseven dollars and seventyfive cents  and then he hadfetched away a threegallon jug of whisky too that he found under awagon when he was starting home through the woods  the king saidtake it all around it laid over any day hed ever put in in themissionarying line  he said it warnt no use talking heathens dontamount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a campmeeting withthe duke was thinking hed been doing pretty well till the king cometo show up but after that he didnt think so so much  he had setup and printed off two little jobs for farmers in thatprintingofficehorse billsand took the money four dollars  and hehad got in ten dollars worth of advertisements for the paper which hesaid he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advancesothey done it the price of the paper was two dollars a year but he tookin three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of thempaying him in advance they were going to pay in cordwood and onions asusual but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down theprice as low as he could afford it and was going to run it for cash he set up a little piece of poetry which he made himself out ofhis own headthree verseskind of sweet and saddishthe name of it wasyes crush cold world this breaking heartand he left that all setup and ready to print in the paper and didnt charge nothing for it well he took in nine dollars and a half and said hed done a prettysquare days work for itthen he showed us another little job hed printed and hadnt chargedfor because it was for us  it had a picture of a runaway nigger witha bundle on a stick over his shoulder and  reward under it  thereading was all about jim and just described him to a dot  it saidhe run away from st jacques plantation forty mile below new orleanslast winter and likely went north and whoever would catch him and sendhim back he could have the reward and expensesnow says the duke after tonight we can run in the daytime if wewant to  whenever we see anybody coming we can tie jim hand and footwith a rope and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say wecaptured him up the river and were too poor to travel on a steamboatso we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going downto get the reward  handcuffs and chains would look still better on jimbut it wouldnt go well with the story of us being so poor  too muchlike jewelry  ropes are the correct thingwe must preserve the unitiesas we say on the boardswe all said the duke was pretty smart and there couldnt be no troubleabout running daytimes  we judged we could make miles enough that nightto get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the dukes work inthe printing office was going to make in that little town then we couldboom right along if we wanted towe laid low and kept still and never shoved out till nearly tenoclock then we slid by pretty wide away from the town and didnthoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of itwhen jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning he sayshuck does you reckn we gwyne to run acrost any mo kings on distripno i says i reckon notwell says he dats all right den  i doan mine one er two kingsbut dats enough  dis ones powerful drunk en de duke ain muchbetteri found jim had been trying to get him to talk french so he could hearwhat it was like but he said he had been in this country so long andhad so much trouble hed forgot itit was after sunup now but we went right on and didnt tie up  theking and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty but aftertheyd jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a gooddeal after breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the raftand pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches and let his legsdangle in the water so as to be comfortable and lit his pipe and wentto getting his romeo and juliet by heart  when he had got it prettygood him and the duke begun to practice it together  the duke had tolearn him over and over again how to say every speech and he made himsigh and put his hand on his heart and after a while he said he doneit pretty well only he says you mustnt bellow out romeothat way like a bullyou must say it soft and sick and languishysoroomeo that is the idea for juliets a dear sweet mere child ofa girl you know and she doesnt bray like a jackasswell next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made outof oak laths and begun to practice the sword fightthe duke calledhimself richard iii and the way they laid on and pranced aroundthe raft was grand to see  but by and by the king tripped and felloverboard and after that they took a rest and had a talk about allkinds of adventures theyd had in other times along the riverafter dinner the duke sayswell capet well want to make this a firstclass show you know soi guess well add a little more to it  we want a little something toanswer encores with anywaywhats onkores bilgewaterthe duke told him and then saysill answer by doing the highland fling or the sailors hornpipe andyouwell let me seeoh ive got ityou can do hamlets soliloquyhamlets whichhamlets soliloquy you

walk up and down a minute and see if i can callit back from recollections vaultsso he went to marching up and down thinking and frowning horribleevery now and then then he would hoist up his eyebrows next he wouldsqueeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan nexthe would sigh and next hed let on to drop a tear  it was beautifulto see him by and by he got it  he told us to give attention  thenhe strikes a most noble attitude with one leg shoved forwards and hisarms stretched away up and his head tilted back looking up at the skyand then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth and after thatall through his speech he howled and spread around and swelled up hischest and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever i see before this is the speechi learned it easy enough while he was learning itto the kingto be or not to be that is the bare bodkin that makes calamity ofso long life for who would fardels bear till birnam wood do cometo dunsinane but that the fear of

that speech and he mighty soon got it so hecould do it first rate it seemed like he was just born for it and whenhe had his hand in and was excited it was perfectly lovely the way hewould rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it offthe first chance we got the duke he had some show bills printed andafter that for two or three days as we floated along the raft was amost uncommon lively place for there warnt nothing but swordfightingand rehearsingas the duke called itgoing on all the time one morningwhen we was pretty well down the state of arkansaw we come in sightof a little onehorse town in a big bend so we tied up aboutthreequarters of a mile above it in the mouth of a crick which wasshut in like a tunnel by the cypress trees and all of us but jim tookthe canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in thatplace for our showwe struck it mighty lucky there was going to be a circus there thatafternoon and the country people was already beginning to come in inall kinds of old shackly wagons and on horses the circus would leavebefore night so our show would have a pretty good chance the duke hehired the court house and we went around and stuck up our

set up three or four foot above ground on stilts so as to be out ofreach of the water when the river was overflowed the houses had littlegardens around them but they didnt seem to raise hardly anything inthem but jimpson weeds and sunflowers and ashpiles and old curledupboots and shoes and pieces of bottles and rags and playedouttinware the fences was made of different kinds of boards nailed onat different times and they leaned every whichway and had gates thatdidnt generly have but one hingea leather one some of the fenceshad been whitewashed some time or another but the duke said it was inclumbuss time like enough there was generly hogs in the garden andpeople driving them outall the stores was along one street  they had white domestic awnings infront and the country people hitched their horses to the awningpoststhere was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings and loafers roostingon them all day long whittling them with their barlow knives andchawing tobacco and gaping and yawning and stretchinga mighty ornerylot they generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrellabut didnt wear no coats nor waistcoats they called one another billand buck and hank and joe and andy and talked lazy and drawly andused considerable many cuss words  there was as many as one loaferleaning up against every awningpost and he most always had his handsin his britchespockets except when he fetched them out to lend a chawof tobacco or scratch  what a body was hearing amongst them all thetime wasgimme a chaw v tobacker hankcaint i haint got but one chaw left  ask billmaybe bill he gives him a chaw maybe he lies and says he aint gotnone some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world nor achaw of tobacco of their own  they get all their chawing by

fellows mostly chaws thenatural leaf twisted  when they borrow a chaw they dont generly cut itoff with a knife but set the plug in between their teeth and gnaw withtheir teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it intwo then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at itwhen its handed back and says sarcastichere gimme the chaw and you take the plugall the streets and lanes was just mud they warnt nothing else butmudmud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some placesand two or three inches deep in all the places  the hogs loafed andgrunted around everywheres  youd see a muddy sow and a litter of pigscome lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the waywhere folks had to walk around her and shed stretch out and shut hereyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her and look ashappy as if she was on salary and pretty soon youd hear a loafersing out hi  so boy sick him tige and away the sow would gosquealing most horrible with a dog or two swinging to each ear andthree or four dozen more acoming and then you would see all theloafers get up and watch the thing out of sight and laugh at the funand look grateful for the noise  then theyd settle back again tillthere was a dog fight  there couldnt anything wake them up all overand make them happy all over like a dog fightunless it might beputting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him or tying atin pan to his tail and see him run himself to deathon the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bankand they was bowed and bent and about ready to tumble in the peoplehad moved out of them  the bank was caved away under one corner of someothers and that corner was hanging over  people lived in them yet butit was dangersome because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a housecaves in at a time  sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deepwill start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into theriver in one summer such a town as that has to be always moving backand back and back because the rivers always gnawing at itthe nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was thewagons and horses in
