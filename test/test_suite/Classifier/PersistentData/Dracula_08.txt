thank god this will be the last night of her looking on atour conferences and feeling the sting of our not showing ourconfidence it took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution ofkeeping her out of our grim task she seems somehow more reconciled orelse the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her for whenany accidental allusion is made she actually shudders i am glad wemade our resolution in time as with such a feeling as this our growingknowledge would be torture to heri could not tell the others of the days discovery till we were aloneso after dinnerfollowed by a little music to save appearances evenamongst ourselvesi took mina to her room and left her to go to bedthe dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever and clung to meas though she would detain me but there was much to be talked of and icame away thank god the ceasing of telling things has made nodifference between uswhen i came down again i found the others all gathered round the fire inthe study in the train i had written my diary so far and simply readit off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my owninformation when i had finished van helsing saidthis has been a great days work friend jonathan doubtless we are onthe track of the missing boxes if we find them all in that house thenour work is near the end but if there be some missing we must searchuntil we find them then shall we make our final coup and hunt thewretch to his real death we all sat silent awhile and all at once mrmorris spokesay how are we going to get into that housewe got into the other answered lord godalming quicklybut art this is different we broke house at carfax but we had nightand a walled park to protect us it will be a mighty different thing tocommit burglary in piccadilly either by day or night i confess i dontsee how we are going to get in unless that agency duck can find us a keyof some sort perhaps we shall know when you get his letter in themorning lord godalmings brows contracted and he stood up and walkedabout the room byandby he stopped and said turning from one toanother of usquinceys head is level this burglary business is getting serious wegot off once all right but we have now a rare job on handunless wecan find the counts key basketas nothing could well be done before morning and as it would be atleast advisable to wait till lord godalming should hear from mitchellswe decided not to take any active step before breakfast time for a goodwhile we sat and smoked discussing the matter in its various lights andbearings i took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to themoment i am very sleepy and shall go to bedjust a line mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular herforehead is puckered up into little wrinkles as though she thinks evenin her sleep she is still too pale but does not look so haggard as shedid this morning tomorrow will i hope mend all this she will beherself at home in exeter oh but i am sleepydr sewards diary octoberi am puzzled afresh about renfield his moods change sorapidly that i find it difficult to keep touch of them and as theyalways mean something more than his own wellbeing they form a morethan interesting study this morning when i went to see him after hisrepulse of van helsing his manner was that of a man commanding destinyhe was in fact commanding destinysubjectively he did not reallycare for any of the things of mere earth he was in the clouds andlooked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals ithought i would improve the occasion and learn something so i askedhimwhat about the flies these times he smiled on me in quite a superiorsort of waysuch a smile as would have become the face of malvolioashe answered methe fly my dear sir has one striking feature its wings are typicalof the aërial powers of the psychic faculties the ancients did wellwhen they typified the soul as a butterflyi thought i would push his analogy to its utmost logically so i saidquicklyoh it is a soul you are after now is it his madness foiled hisreason and a puzzled look spread over his face as shaking his headwith a decision which i had but seldom seen in him he saidoh no oh no i want no souls life is all i want here he brightenedup i am pretty indifferent about it at present life is all right ihave all i want you must get a new patient doctor if you wish tostudy zoöphagythis puzzled me a little so i drew him onthen you command life you are a god i suppose he smiled with anineffably benign superiorityoh no far be it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of thedeity i am not even concerned in his especially spiritual doings if imay state my intellectual position i am so far as concerns thingspurely terrestrial somewhat in the position which enoch occupiedspiritually this was a poser to me i could not at the moment recallenochs appositeness so i had to ask a simple question though i feltthat by so doing i was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunaticand why with enochbecause he walked with god i could not see the analogy but did notlike to admit it so i harked back to what he had deniedso you dont care about life and you dont want souls why not i putmy question quickly and somewhat sternly on purpose to disconcert himthe effort succeeded for an instant he unconsciously relapsed into hisold servile manner bent low before me and actually fawned upon me ashe repliedi dont want any souls indeed indeed i dont i couldnt use them ifi had them they would be no manner of use to me i couldnt eat themor he suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over hisface like a windsweep on the surface of the water and doctor as tolife what is it after all when youve got all you require and youknow that you will never want that is all i have friendsgoodfriendslike you dr seward this was said with a leer ofinexpressible cunning i know that i shall never lack the means oflifei think that through the cloudiness of his insanity he saw someantagonism in me for he at once fell back on the last refuge of such ashea dogged silence after a short time i saw that for the present itwas useless to speak to him he was sulky and so i came awaylater in the day he sent for me ordinarily i would not have comewithout special reason but just at present i am so interested in himthat i would gladly make an effort besides i am glad to have anythingto help to pass the time harker is out following up clues and so arelord godalming and quincey van helsing sits in my study poring over therecord prepared by the harkers he seems to think that by accurateknowledge of all details he will light upon some clue he does not wishto be disturbed in the work without cause i would have taken him withme to see the patient only i thought that after his last repulse hemight not care to go again there was also another reason renfieldmight not speak so freely before a third person as when he and i werealonei found him sitting out in the middle of the floor on his stool a posewhich is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part when icame in he said at once as though the question had been waiting on hislipswhat about souls it was evident then that my surmise had beencorrect unconscious cerebration was doing its work even with thelunatic i determined to have the matter out what about themyourself i asked he did not reply for a moment but looked all roundhim and up and down as though he expected to find some inspiration foran answeri dont want any souls he said in a feeble apologetic way thematter seemed preying on his mind and so i determined to use itto becruel only to be kind so i saidyou like life and you want lifeoh yes but that is all right you neednt worry about thatbut i asked how are we to get the life without getting the soulalso this seemed to puzzle him so i followed it upa nice time youll have some time when youre flying out there withthe souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzingand twittering and miauing all round you youve got their lives youknow and you must put up with their souls something seemed to affecthis imagination for he put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyesscrewing them up tightly just as a small boy does when his face is beingsoaped there was something pathetic in it that touched me it also gaveme a lesson for it seemed that before me was a childonly a childthough the features were worn and the stubble on the jaws was white itwas evident that he was undergoing some process of mental disturbanceand knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreignto himself i thought i would enter into his mind as well as i could andgo with him the first step was to restore confidence so i asked himspeaking pretty loud so that he would hear me through his closed earswould you like some sugar to get your flies round again he seemed towake up all at once and shook his head with a laugh he repliednot much flies are poor things after all after a pause he addedbut i dont want their souls buzzing round me all the sameor spiders i went onblow spiders whats the use of spiders there isnt anything in themto eat orhe stopped suddenly as though reminded of a forbiddentopicso so i thought to myself this is the second time he has suddenlystopped at the word drink what does it mean renfield seemed himselfaware of having made a lapse for he hurried on as though to distractmy attention from iti dont take any stock at all in such matters rats and mice and suchsmall deer as shakespeare has it chickenfeed of the larder theymight be called im past all that sort of nonsense you might as wellask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chopsticks as to try tointerest me about the lesser carnivora when i know of what is beforemei see i said you want big things that you can make your teeth meetin how would you like to breakfast on elephantwhat ridiculous nonsense you are talking he was getting too wideawake so i thought i would press him hard i wonder i saidreflectively what an elephants soul is likethe effect i desired was obtained for he at once fell from hishighhorse and became a child againi dont want an elephants soul or any soul at all he said for afew moments he sat despondently suddenly he jumped to his feet withhis eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement tohell with you and your souls he shouted why do you plague me aboutsouls havent i got enough to worry and pain and distract me alreadywithout thinking of souls he looked so hostile that i thought he wasin for another homicidal fit so i blew my whistle the instanthowever that i did so he became calm and said apologeticallyforgive me doctor i forgot myself you do not need any help i am soworried in my mind that i am apt to be irritable if you only knew theproblem i have to face and that i am working out you would pity andtolerate and pardon me pray do not put me in a straitwaistcoat iwant to think and i cannot think freely when my body is confined i amsure you will understand he had evidently selfcontrol so when theattendants came i told them not to mind and they withdrew renfieldwatched them go when the door was closed he said with considerabledignity and sweetnessdr seward you have been very considerate towards me believe me thati am very very grateful to you i thought it well to leave him in thismood and so i came away there is certainly something to ponder over inthis mans state several points seem to make what the americaninterviewer calls a story if one could only get them in proper orderhere they arewill not mention drinkingfears the thought of being burdened with the soul of anythinghas no dread of wanting life in the futuredespises the meaner forms of life altogether though he dreads beinghaunted by their soulslogically all these things point one way he has assurance of some kindthat he will acquire some higher life he dreads the consequencetheburden of a soul then it is a human life he looks toand the assurancemerciful god the count has been to him and there is some new scheme ofterror afoot                                   lateri went after my round to van helsing and told him mysuspicion he grew very grave and after thinking the matter over for awhile asked me to take him to renfield i did so as we came to the doorwe heard the lunatic within singing gaily as he used to do in the timewhich now seems so long ago when we entered we saw with amazement thathe had spread out his sugar as of old the flies lethargic with theautumn were beginning to buzz into the room we tried to make him talkof the subject of our previous conversation but he would not attend hewent on with his singing just as though we had not been present he hadgot a scrap of paper and was folding it into a notebook we had to comeaway as ignorant as we went inhis is a curious case indeed we must watch him tonight octobermy lordwe are at all times only too happy to meet your wishes we beg withregard to the desire of your lordship expressed by mr harker on yourbehalf to supply the following information concerning the sale andpurchase of no  piccadilly the original vendors are the executorsof the late mr archibald wintersuffield the purchaser is a foreignnobleman count de ville who effected the purchase himself paying thepurchase money in notes over the counter if your lordship will pardonus using so vulgar an expression beyond this we know nothing whateverof himwe are my lordyour lordships humble servantsmitchell sons  candydr sewards diary octoberi placed a man in the corridor last night and told him tomake an accurate note of any sound he might hear from renfields roomand gave him instructions that if there should be anything strange hewas to call me after dinner when we had all gathered round the firein the studymrs harker having gone to bedwe discussed the attemptsand discoveries of the day harker was the only one who had any resultand we are in great hopes that his clue may be an important onebefore going to bed i went round to the patients room and looked inthrough the observation trap he was sleeping soundly and his heartrose and fell with regular respirationthis morning the man on duty reported to me that a little after midnighthe was restless and kept saying his prayers somewhat loudly i asked himif that was all he replied that it was all he heard there wassomething about his manner so suspicious that i asked him point blank ifhe had been asleep he denied sleep but admitted to having dozed fora while it is too bad that men cannot be trusted unless they arewatchedtoday harker is out following up his clue and art and quincey arelooking after horses godalming thinks that it will be well to havehorses always in readiness for when we get the information which weseek there will be no time to lose we must sterilise all the importedearth between sunrise and sunset we shall thus catch the count at hisweakest and without a refuge to fly to van helsing is off to thebritish museum looking up some authorities on ancient medicine the oldphysicians took account of things which their followers do not acceptand the professor is searching for witch and demon cures which may beuseful to us lateri sometimes think we must be all mad and that we shall wake to sanity instraitwaistcoats                                   laterwe have met again we seem at last to be on the track and ourwork of tomorrow may be the beginning of the end i wonder ifrenfields quiet has anything to do with this his moods have sofollowed the doings of the count that the coming destruction of themonster may be carried to him in some subtle way if we could only getsome hint as to what passed in his mind between the time of my argumentwith him today and his resumption of flycatching it might afford us avaluable clue he is now seemingly quiet for a spell is he thatwild yell seemed to come from his room                                   the attendant came bursting into my room and told me that renfield hadsomehow met with some accident he had heard him yell and when he wentto him found him lying on his face on the floor all covered with bloodi must go at once octoberlet me put down with exactness all that happened as wellas i can remember it since last i made an entry not a detail that ican recall must be forgotten in all calmness i must proceedwhen i came to renfields room i found him lying on the floor on hisleft side in a glittering pool of blood when i went to move him itbecame at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuriesthere seemed none of that unity of purpose between the parts of the bodywhich marks even lethargic sanity as the face was exposed i could seethat it was horribly bruised as though it had been beaten against thefloorindeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of bloodoriginated the attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me aswe turned him overi think sir his back is broken see both his right arm and leg andthe whole side of his face are paralysed how such a thing could havehappened puzzled the attendant beyond measure he seemed quitebewildered and his brows were gathered in as he saidi cant understand the two things he could mark his face like that bybeating his own head on the floor i saw a young woman do it once at theeversfield asylum before anyone could lay hands on her and i suppose hemight have broke his neck by falling out of bed if he got in an awkwardkink but for the life of me i cant imagine how the two thingsoccurred if his back was broke he couldnt beat his head and if hisface was like that before the fall out of bed there would be marks ofit i said to himgo to dr van helsing and ask him to kindly come here at once i wanthim without an instants delay the man ran off and within a fewminutes the professor in his dressing gown and slippers appeared whenhe saw renfield on the ground he looked keenly at him a moment andthen turned to me i think he recognised my thought in my eyes for hesaid very quietly manifestly for the ears of the attendantah a sad accident he will need very careful watching and muchattention i shall stay with you myself but i shall first dress myselfif you will remain i shall in a few minutes join youthe patient was now breathing stertorously and it was easy to see thathe had suffered some terrible injury van helsing returned withextraordinary celerity bearing with him a surgical case he hadevidently been thinking and had his mind made up for almost before helooked at the patient he whispered to mesend the attendant away we must be alone with him when he becomesconscious after the operation so i saidi think that will do now simmons we have done all that we can atpresent you had better go your round and dr van helsing will operatelet me know instantly if there be anything unusual anywherethe man withdrew and we went into a strict examination of the patientthe wounds of the face was superficial the real injury was a depressedfracture of the skull extending right up through the motor area theprofessor thought a moment and saidwe must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions as faras can be the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature ofhis injury the whole motor area seems affected the suffusion of thebrain will increase quickly so we must trephine at once or it may betoo late as he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door iwent over and opened it and found in the corridor without arthur andquincey in pajamas and slippers the former spokei heard your man call up dr van helsing and tell him of an accidentso i woke quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep thingsare moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of usthese times ive been thinking that tomorrow night will not see thingsas they have been well have to look backand forward a little morethan we have done may we come in i nodded and held the door opentill they had entered then i closed it again when quincey saw theattitude and state of the patient and noted the horrible pool on thefloor he said softlymy god what has happened to him poor poor devil i told himbriefly and added that we expected he would recover consciousness afterthe operationfor a short time at all events he went at once and satdown on the edge of the bed with godalming beside him we all watchedin patiencewe shall wait said van helsing just long enough to fix the bestspot for trephining so that we may most quickly and perfectly removethe blood clot for it is evident that the hæmorrhage is increasingthe minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness i had ahorrible sinking in my heart and from van helsings face i gatheredthat he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come i dreadedthe words that renfield might speak i was positively afraid to thinkbut the conviction of what was coming was on me as i have read of menwho have heard the deathwatch the poor mans breathing came inuncertain gasps each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyesand speak but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath and hewould relapse into a more fixed insensibility inured as i was to sickbeds and death this suspense grew and grew upon me i could almosthear the beating of my own heart and the blood surging through mytemples sounded like blows from a hammer the silence finally becameagonising i looked at my companions one after another and saw fromtheir flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equaltorture there was a nervous suspense over us all as though overheadsome dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expectitat last there came a time when it was evident that the patient wassinking fast he might die at any moment i looked up at the professorand caught his eyes fixed on mine his face was sternly set as hespokethere is no time to lose his words may be worth many lives i havebeen thinking so as i stood here it may be there is a soul at stakewe shall operate just above the earwithout another word he made the operation for a few moments thebreathing continued to be stertorous then there came a breath soprolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chestsuddenly his eyes opened and became fixed in a wild helpless starethis was continued for a few moments then it softened into a gladsurprise and from the lips came a sigh of relief he movedconvulsively and as he did so saidill be quiet doctor tell them to take off the straitwaistcoat ihave had a terrible dream and it has left me so weak that i cannotmove whats wrong with my face it feels all swollen and it smartsdreadfully he tried to turn his head but even with the effort hiseyes seemed to grow glassy again so i gently put it back then vanhelsing said in a quiet grave tonetell us your dream mr renfield as he heard the voice his facebrightened through its mutilation and he saidthat is dr van helsing how good it is of you to be here give me somewater my lips are dry and i shall try to tell you i dreamedhestopped and seemed fainting i called quietly to quinceythebrandyit is in my studyquick he flew and returned with a glassthe decanter of brandy and a carafe of water we moistened the parchedlips and the patient quickly revived it seemed however that his poorinjured brain had been working in the interval for when he was quiteconscious he looked at me piercingly with an agonised confusion which ishall never forget and saidi must not deceive myself it was no dream but all a grim realitythen his eyes roved round the room as they caught sight of the twofigures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went onif i were not sure already i would know from them for an instant hiseyes closednot with pain or sleep but voluntarily as though he werebringing all his faculties to bear when he opened them he saidhurriedly and with more energy than he had yet displayedquick doctor quick i am dying i feel that i have but a few minutesand then i must go back to deathor worse wet my lips with brandyagain i have something that i must say before i die or before my poorcrushed brain dies anyhow thank you it was that night after you leftme when i implored you to let me go away i couldnt speak then for ifelt my tongue was tied but i was as sane then except in that way asi am now i was in an agony of despair for a long time after you leftme it seemed hours then there came a sudden peace to me my brainseemed to become cool again and i realised where i was i heard thedogs bark behind our house but not where he was as he spoke vanhelsings eyes never blinked but his hand came out and met mine andgripped it hard he did not however betray himself he nodded slightlyand said go on in a low voice renfield proceededhe came up to the window in the mist as i had seen him often beforebut he was solid thennot a ghost and his eyes were fierce like amans when angry he was laughing with his red mouth the sharp whiteteeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look back over the beltof trees to where the dogs were barking i wouldnt ask him to come inat first though i knew he wanted tojust as he had wanted all alongthen he began promising me thingsnot in words but by doing them hewas interrupted by a word from the professorhowby making them happen just as he used to send in the flies when thesun was shining great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on theirwings and big moths in the night with skull and crossbones on theirbacks van helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciouslythe acherontia aitetropos of the sphingeswhat you call thedeathshead moth the patient went on without stoppingthen he began to whisper rats rats rats hundreds thousandsmillions of them and every one a life and dogs to eat them and catstoo all lives all red blood with years of life in it and not merelybuzzing flies i laughed at him for i wanted to see what he could dothen the dogs howled away beyond the dark trees in his house hebeckoned me to the window i got up and looked out and he raised hishands and seemed to call out without using any words a dark massspread over the grass coming on like the shape of a flame of fire andthen he moved the mist to the right and left and i could see that therewere thousands of rats with their eyes blazing redlike his onlysmaller he held up his hand and they all stopped and i thought heseemed to be saying all these lives will i give you ay and many moreand greater through countless ages if you will fall down and worshipme and then a red cloud like the colour of blood seemed to closeover my eyes and before i knew what i was doing i found myself openingthe sash and saying to him come in lord and master the rats wereall gone but he slid into the room through the sash though it was onlyopen an inch widejust as the moon herself has often come in throughthe tiniest crack and has stood before me in all her size andsplendourhis voice was weaker so i moistened his lips with the brandy again andhe continued but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working inthe interval for his story was further advanced i was about to call himback to the point but van helsing whispered to me let him go on donot interrupt him he cannot go back and maybe could not proceed at allif once he lost the thread of his thought he proceededall day i waited to hear from him but he did not send me anything noteven a blowfly and when the moon got up i was pretty angry with himwhen he slid in through the window though it was shut and did not evenknock i got mad with him he sneered at me and his white face lookedout of the mist with his red eyes gleaming and he went on as though heowned the whole place and i was no one he didnt even smell the sameas he went by me i couldnt hold him i thought that somehow mrsharker had come into the roomthe two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over standing behindhim so that he could not see them but where they could hear betterthey were both silent but the professor started and quivered his facehowever grew grimmer and sterner still renfield went on withoutnoticingwhen mrs harker came in to see me this afternoon she wasnt the sameit was like tea after the teapot had been watered here we all movedbut no one said a word he went oni didnt know that she was here till she spoke and she didnt look thesame i dont care for the pale people i like them with lots of bloodin them and hers had all seemed to have run out i didnt think of itat the time but when she went away i began to think and it made me madto know that he had been taking the life out of her i could feel thatthe rest quivered as i did but we remained otherwise still so whenhe came tonight i was ready for him i saw the mist stealing in and igrabbed it tight i had heard that madmen have unnatural strength andas i knew i was a madmanat times anyhowi resolved to use my poweray and he felt it too for he had to come out of the mist to strugglewith me i held tight and i thought i was going to win for i didntmean him to take any more of her life till i saw his eyes they burnedinto me and my strength became like water he slipped through it andwhen i tried to cling to him he raised me up and flung me down therewas a red cloud before me and a noise like thunder and the mist seemedto steal away under the door his voice was becoming fainter and hisbreath more stertorous van helsing stood up instinctivelywe know the worst now he said he is here and we know his purposeit may not be too late let us be armedthe same as we were the othernight but lose no time there is not an instant to spare there was noneed to put our fear nay our conviction into wordswe shared them incommon we all hurried and took from our rooms the same things that wehad when we entered the counts house the professor had his ready andas we met in the corridor he pointed to them significantly as he saidthey never leave me and they shall not till this unhappy business isover be wise also my friends it is no common enemy that we deal withalas alas that that dear madam mina should suffer he stopped hisvoice was breaking and i do not know if rage or terror predominated inmy own heartoutside the harkers door we paused art and quincey held back and thelatter saidshould we disturb herwe must said van helsing grimly if the door be locked i shallbreak it inmay it not frighten her terribly it is unusual to break into a ladysroomvan helsing said solemnly you are always right but this is life anddeath all chambers are alike to the doctor and even were they not theyare all as one to me tonight friend john when i turn the handle ifthe door does not open do you put your shoulder down and shove and youtoo my friends nowhe turned the handle as he spoke but the door did not yield we threwourselves against it with a crash it burst open and we almost fellheadlong into the room the professor did actually fall and i sawacross him as he gathered himself up from hands and knees what i sawappalled me i felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my neckand my heart seemed to stand stillthe moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the roomwas light enough to see on the bed beside the window lay jonathanharker his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stuporkneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the whitecladfigure of his wife by her side stood a tall thin man clad in blackhis face was turned from us but the instant we saw we all recognisedthe countin every way even to the scar on his forehead with his lefthand he held both mrs harkers hands keeping them away with her armsat full tension his right hand gripped her by the back of the neckforcing her face down on his bosom her white nightdress was smearedwith blood and a thin stream trickled down the mans bare breast whichwas shown by his tornopen dress the attitude of the two had a terribleresemblance to a child forcing a kittens nose into a saucer of milk tocompel it to drink as we burst into the room the count turned hisface and the hellish look that i had heard described seemed to leapinto it his eyes flamed red with devilish passion the great nostrilsof the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge and thewhite sharp teeth behind the full lips of the blooddripping mouthchamped together like those of a wild beast with a wrench which threwhis victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height he turnedand sprang at us but by this time the professor had gained his feetand was holding towards him the envelope which contained the sacredwafer the count suddenly stopped just as poor lucy had done outsidethe tomb and cowered back further and further back he cowered as welifting our crucifixes advanced the moonlight suddenly failed as agreat black cloud sailed across the sky and when the gaslight sprang upunder quinceys match we saw nothing but a faint vapour this as welooked trailed under the door which with the recoil from its burstingopen had swung back to its old position van helsing art and i movedforward to mrs harker who by this time had drawn her breath and withit had given a scream so wild so earpiercing so despairing that itseems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day for afew seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray her face wasghastly with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smearedher lips and cheeks and chin from her throat trickled a thin stream ofblood her eyes were mad with terror then she put before her face herpoor crushed hands which bore on their whiteness the red mark of thecounts terrible grip and from behind them came a low desolate wailwhich made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of anendless grief van helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gentlyover her body whilst art after looking at her face for an instantdespairingly ran out of the room van helsing whispered to mejonathan is in a stupor such as we know the vampire can produce we cando nothing with poor madam mina for a few moments till she recoversherself i must wake him he dipped the end of a towel in cold waterand with it began to flick him on the face his wife all the whileholding her face between her hands and sobbing in a way that washeartbreaking to hear i raised the blind and looked out of thewindow there was much moonshine and as i looked i could see quinceymorris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a greatyewtree it puzzled me to think why he was doing this but at theinstant i heard harkers quick exclamation as he woke to partialconsciousness and turned to the bed on his face as there might wellbe was a look of wild amazement he seemed dazed for a few seconds andthen full consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once and hestarted up his wife was aroused by the quick movement and turned tohim with her arms stretched out as though to embrace him instantlyhowever she drew them in again and putting her elbows together heldher hands before her face and shuddered till the bed beneath her shookin gods name what does this mean harker cried out dr seward drvan helsing what is it what has happened what is wrong mina dearwhat is it what does that blood mean my god my god has it come tothis and raising himself to his knees he beat his hands wildlytogether good god help us help her oh help her with a quickmovement he jumped from bed and began to pull on his clothesall theman in him awake at the need for instant exertion what has happenedtell me all about it he cried without pausing dr van helsing youlove mina i know oh do something to save her it cannot have gone toofar yet guard her while i look for him his wife through her terrorand horror and distress saw some sure danger to him instantlyforgetting her own grief she seized hold of him and cried outno no jonathan you must not leave me i have suffered enoughtonight god knows without the dread of his harming you you must staywith me stay with these friends who will watch over you herexpression became frantic as she spoke and he yielding to her shepulled him down sitting on the bed side and clung to him fiercelyvan helsing and i tried to calm them both the professor held up hislittle golden crucifix and said with wonderful calmnessdo not fear my dear we are here and whilst this is close to you nofoul thing can approach you are safe for tonight and we must be calmand take counsel together she shuddered and was silent holding downher head on her husbands breast when she raised it his whitenightrobe was stained with blood where her lips had touched and wherethe thin open wound in her neck had sent forth drops the instant shesaw it she drew back with a low wail and whispered amidst chokingsobsunclean unclean i must touch him or kiss him no more oh that itshould be that it is i who am now his worst enemy and whom he may havemost cause to fear to this he spoke out resolutelynonsense mina it is a shame to me to hear such a word i would nothear it of you and i shall not hear it from you may god judge me by mydeserts and punish me with more bitter suffering than even this hourif by any act or will of mine anything ever come between us he put outhis arms and folded her to his breast and for a while she lay theresobbing he looked at us over her bowed head with eyes that blinkeddamply above his quivering nostrils his mouth was set as steel after awhile her sobs became less frequent and more faint and then he said tome speaking with a studied calmness which i felt tried his nervouspower to the utmostand now dr seward tell me all about it too well i know the broadfact tell me all that has been i told him exactly what had happenedand he listened with seeming impassiveness but his nostrils twitchedand his eyes blazed as i told how the ruthless hands of the count hadheld his wife in that terrible and horrid position with her mouth tothe open wound in his breast it interested me even at that moment tosee that whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively overthe bowed head the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffledhair just as i had finished quincey and godalming knocked at the doorthey entered in obedience to our summons van helsing looked at mequestioningly i understood him to mean if we were to take advantage oftheir coming to divert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husbandand wife from each other and from themselves so on nodding acquiescenceto him he asked them what they had seen or done to which lord godalmingansweredi could not see him anywhere in the passage or in any of our rooms ilooked in the study but though he had been there he had gone he hadhowever he stopped suddenly looking at the poor drooping figure onthe bed van helsing said gravelygo on friend arthur we want here no more concealments our hope nowis in knowing all tell freely so art went onhe had been there and though it could only have been for a fewseconds he made rare hay of the place all the manuscript had beenburned and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes thecylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire and the waxhad helped the flames here i interrupted thank god there is theother copy in the safe his face lit for a moment but fell again as hewent on i ran downstairs then but could see no sign of him i lookedinto renfields room but there was no trace there except again hepaused go on said harker hoarsely so he bowed his head andmoistening his lips with his tongue added except that the poor fellowis dead mrs harker raised her head looking from one to the other ofus she said solemnlygods will be done i could not but feel that art was keeping backsomething but as i took it that it was with a purpose i said nothingvan helsing turned to morris and askedand you friend quincey have you any to tella little he answered it may be much eventually but at present icant say i thought it well to know if possible where the count wouldgo when he left the house i did not see him but i saw a bat rise fromrenfields window and flap westward i expected to see him in someshape go back to carfax but he evidently sought some other lair hewill not be back tonight for the sky is reddening in the east and thedawn is close we must work tomorrowhe said the latter words through his shut teeth for a space of perhapsa couple of minutes there was silence and i could fancy that i couldhear the sound of our hearts beating then van helsing said placing hishand very tenderly on mrs harkers headand now madam minapoor dear dear madam minatell us exactly whathappened god knows that i do not want that you be pained but it isneed that we know all for now more than ever has all work to be donequick and sharp and in deadly earnest the day is close to us that mustend all if it may be so and now is the chance that we may live andlearnthe poor dear lady shivered and i could see the tension of her nervesas she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head lower andlower still on his breast then she raised her head proudly and heldout one hand to van helsing who took it in his and after stooping andkissing it reverently held it fast the other hand was locked in thatof her husband who held his other arm thrown round her protectinglyafter a pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts shebegani took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me but for along time it did not act i seemed to become more wakeful and myriadsof horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mindall of themconnected with death and vampires with blood and pain and troubleher husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and saidlovingly do not fret dear you must be brave and strong and help methrough the horrible task if you only knew what an effort it is to meto tell of this fearful thing at all you would understand how much ineed your help well i saw i must try to help the medicine to its workwith my will if it was to do me any good so i resolutely set myself tosleep sure enough sleep must soon have come to me for i remember nomore jonathan coming in had not waked me for he lay by my side whennext i remember there was in the room the same thin white mist that ihad before noticed but i forget now if you know of this you will findit in my diary which i shall show you later i felt the same vagueterror which had come to me before and the same sense of some presencei turned to wake jonathan but found that he slept so soundly that itseemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping draught and not i itried but i could not wake him this caused me a great fear and ilooked around terrified then indeed my heart sank within me besidethe bed as if he had stepped out of the mistor rather as if the misthad turned into his figure for it had entirely disappearedstood atall thin man all in black i knew him at once from the description ofthe others the waxen face the high aquiline nose on which the lightfell in a thin white line the parted red lips with the sharp whiteteeth showing between and the red eyes that i had seemed to see in thesunset on the windows of st marys church at whitby i knew too thered scar on his forehead where jonathan had struck him for an instantmy heart stood still and i would have screamed out only that i wasparalysed in the pause he spoke in a sort of keen cutting whisperpointing as he spoke to jonathansilence if you make a sound i shall take him and dash his brains outbefore your very eyes i was appalled and was too bewildered to do orsay anything with a mocking smile he placed one hand upon my shoulderand holding me tight bared my throat with the other saying as he didso first a little refreshment to reward my exertions you may as wellbe quiet it is not the first time or the second that your veins haveappeased my thirst i was bewildered and strangely enough i did notwant to hinder him i suppose it is a part of the horrible curse thatsuch is when his touch is on his victim and oh my god my god pityme he placed his reeking lips upon my throat her husband groanedagain she clasped his hand harder and looked at him pityingly as ifhe were the injured one and went oni felt my strength fading away and i was in a half swoon how longthis horrible thing lasted i know not but it seemed that a long timemust have passed before he took his foul awful sneering mouth away isaw it drip with the fresh blood the remembrance seemed for a while tooverpower her and she drooped and would have sunk down but for herhusbands sustaining arm with a great effort she recovered herself andwent onthen he spoke to me mockingly and so you like the others would playyour brains against mine you would help these men to hunt me andfrustrate me in my designs you know now and they know in part alreadyand will know in full before long what it is to cross my path theyshould have kept their energies for use closer to home whilst theyplayed wits against meagainst me who commanded nations and intriguedfor them and fought for them hundreds of years before they wereborni was countermining them and you their best beloved one are nowto me flesh of my flesh blood of my blood kin of my kin my bountifulwinepress for a while and shall be later on my companion and myhelper you shall be avenged in turn for not one of them but shallminister to your needs but as yet you are to be punished for what youhave done you have aided in thwarting me now you shall come to mycall when my brain says come to you you shall cross land or sea todo my bidding and to that end this with that he pulled open hisshirt and with his long sharp nails opened a vein in his breast whenthe blood began to spurt out he took my hands in one of his holdingthem tight and with the other seized my neck and pressed my mouth tothe wound so that i must either suffocate or swallow some of the ohmy god my god what have i done what have i done to deserve such afate i who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all mydays god pity me look down on a poor soul in worse than mortal periland in mercy pity those to whom she is dear then she began to rub herlips as though to cleanse them from pollutionas she was telling her terrible story the eastern sky began to quickenand everything became more and more clear harker was still and quietbut over his face as the awful narrative went on came a grey lookwhich deepened and deepened in the morning light till when the firstred streak of the coming dawn shot up the flesh stood darkly outagainst the whitening hairwe have arranged that one of us is to stay within call of the unhappypair till we can meet together and arrange about taking actionof this i am sure the sun rises today on no more miserable house inall the great round of its daily course octoberas i must do something or go mad i write this diary itis now six oclock and we are to meet in the study in half an hour andtake something to eat for dr van helsing and dr seward are agreedthat if we do not eat we cannot work our best our best will be godknows required today i must keep writing at every chance for i darenot stop to think all big and little must go down perhaps at the endthe little things may teach us most the teaching big or little couldnot have landed mina or me anywhere worse than we are today howeverwe must trust and hope poor mina told me just now with the tearsrunning down her dear cheeks that it is in trouble and trial that ourfaith is testedthat we must keep on trusting and that god will aid usup to the end the end oh my god what end to work to workwhen dr van helsing and dr seward had come back from seeing poorrenfield we went gravely into what was to be done first dr sewardtold us that when he and dr van helsing had gone down to the room belowthey had found renfield lying on the floor all in a heap his face wasall bruised and crushed in and the bones of the neck were brokendr seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he hadheard anything he said that he had been sitting downhe confessed tohalf dozingwhen he heard loud voices in the room and then renfieldhad called out loudly several times god god god after that therewas a sound of falling and when he entered the room he found him lyingon the floor face down just as the doctors had seen him van helsingasked if he had heard voices or a voice and he said he could notsay that at first it had seemed to him as if there were two but asthere was no one in the room it could have been only one he could swearto it if required that the word god was spoken by the patient drseward said to us when we were alone that he did not wish to go intothe matter the question of an inquest had to be considered and itwould never do to put forward the truth as no one would believe it asit was he thought that on the attendants evidence he could give acertificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed in case thecoroner should demand it there would be a formal inquest necessarilyto the same resultwhen the question began to be discussed as to what should be our nextstep the very first thing we decided was that mina should be in fullconfidence that nothing of any sortno matter how painfulshould bekept from her she herself agreed as to its wisdom and it was pitifulto see her so brave and yet so sorrowful and in such a depth ofdespair there must be no concealment she said alas we have hadtoo much already and besides there is nothing in all the world that cangive me more pain than i have already enduredthan i suffer nowwhatever may happen it must be of new hope or of new courage to mevan helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke and said suddenlybut quietlybut dear madam mina are you not afraid not for yourself but forothers from yourself after what has happened her face grew set in itslines but her eyes shone with the devotion of a martyr as sheansweredah no for my mind is made upto what he asked gently whilst we were all very still for each inour own way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant her answercame with direct simplicity as though she were simply stating a factbecause if i find in myselfand i shall watch keenly for ita sign ofharm to any that i love i shall dieyou would not kill yourself he asked hoarselyi would if there were no friend who loved me who would save me such apain and so desperate an effort she looked at him meaningly as shespoke he was sitting down but now he rose and came close to her andput his hand on her head as he said solemnlymy child there is such an one if it were for your good for myself icould hold it in my account with god to find such an euthanasia for youeven at this moment if it were best nay were it safe but mychild for a moment he seemed choked and a great sob rose in histhroat he gulped it down and went onthere are here some who would stand between you and death you must notdie you must not die by any hand but least of all by your own untilthe other who has fouled your sweet life is true dead you must notdie for if he is still with the quick undead your death would makeyou even as he is no you must live you must struggle and strive tolive though death would seem a boon unspeakable you must fight deathhimself though he come to you in pain or in joy by the day or thenight in safety or in peril on your living soul i charge you that youdo not dienay nor think of deathtill this great evil be past thepoor dear grew white as death and shock and shivered as i have seen aquicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide we were allsilent we could do nothing at length she grew more calm and turning tohim said sweetly but oh so sorrowfully as she held out her handi promise you my dear friend that if god will let me live i shallstrive to do so till if it may be in his good time this horror mayhave passed away from me she was so good and brave that we all feltthat our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her and webegan to discuss what we were to do i told her that she was to have allthe papers in the safe and all the papers or diaries and phonographs wemight hereafter use and was to keep the record as she had done beforeshe was pleased with the prospect of anything to doif pleased couldbe used in connection with so grim an interestas usual van helsing had thought ahead of everyone else and wasprepared with an exact ordering of our workit is perhaps well he said that at our meeting after our visit tocarfax we decided not to do anything with the earthboxes that laythere had we done so the count must have guessed our purpose andwould doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such aneffort with regard to the others but now he does not know ourintentions nay more in all probability he does not know that such apower exists to us as can sterilise his lairs so that he cannot usethem as of old we are now so much further advanced in our knowledge asto their disposition that when we have examined the house inpiccadilly we may track the very last of them today then is oursand in it rests our hope the sun that rose on our sorrow this morningguards us in its course until it sets tonight that monster mustretain whatever form he now has he is confined within the limitationsof his earthly envelope he cannot melt into thin air nor disappearthrough cracks or chinks or crannies if he go through a doorway hemust open the door like a mortal and so we have this day to hunt outall his lairs and sterilise them so we shall if we have not yet catchhim and destroy him drive him to bay in some place where the catchingand the destroying shall be in time sure here i started up for icould not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds sopreciously laden with minas life and happiness were flying from ussince whilst we talked action was impossible but van helsing held uphis hand warningly nay friend jonathan he said in this thequickest way home is the longest way so your proverb say we shall allact and act with desperate quick when the time has come but think inall probable the key of the situation is in that house in piccadillythe count may have many houses which he has bought of them he will havedeeds of purchase keys and other things he will have paper that hewrite on he will have his book of cheques there are many belongingsthat he must have somewhere why not in this place so central so quietwhere he come and go by the front or the back at all hour when in thevery vast of the traffic there is none to notice we shall go there andsearch that house and when we learn what it holds then we do what ourfriend arthur call in his phrases of hunt stop the earths and so werun down our old foxso is it notthen let us come at once i cried we are wasting the preciousprecious time the professor did not move but simply saidand how are we to get into that house in piccadillyany way i cried we shall break in if need beand your police where will they be and what will they sayi was staggered but i knew that if he wished to delay he had a goodreason for it so i said as quietly as i coulddont wait more than need be you know i am sure what torture i aminah my child that i do and indeed there is no wish of me to add toyour anguish but just think what can we do until all the world be atmovement then will come our time i have thought and thought and itseems to me that the simplest way is the best of all now we wish to getinto the house but we have no key is it not so i noddednow suppose that you were in truth the owner of that house and couldnot still get it and think there was to you no conscience of thehousebreaker what would you doi should get a respectable locksmith and set him to work to pick thelock for meand your police they would interfere would they notoh no not if they knew the man was properly employedthen he looked at me as keenly as he spoke all that is in doubt isthe conscience of the employer and the belief of your policemen as towhether or no that employer has a good conscience or a bad one yourpolice must indeed be zealous men and cleveroh so cleverin readingthe heart that they trouble themselves in such matter no no myfriend jonathan you go take the lock off a hundred empty house in thisyour london or of any city in the world and if you do it as suchthings are rightly done and at the time such things are rightly doneno one will interfere i have read of a gentleman who owned a so finehouse in london and when he went for months of summer to switzerlandand lock up his house some burglar came and broke window at back andgot in then he went and made open the shutters in front and walk outand in through the door before the very eyes of the police then hehave an auction in that house and advertise it and put up big noticeand when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods ofthat other man who own them then he go to a builder and he sell himthat house making an agreement that he pull it down and take all awaywithin a certain time and your police and other authority help him allthey can and when that owner come back from his holiday in switzerlandhe find only an empty hole where his house had been this was all doneen règle and in our work we shall be en règle too we shall not goso early that the policemen who have then little to think of shall deemit strange but we shall go after ten oclock when there are manyabout and such things would be done were we indeed owners of thehousei could not but see how right he was and the terrible despair of minasface became relaxed a thought there was hope in such good counsel vanhelsing went onwhen once within that house we may find more clues at any rate some ofus can remain there whilst the rest find the other places where there bemore earthboxesat bermondsey and mile endlord godalming stood up i can be of some use here he said i shallwire to my people to have horses and carriages where they will be mostconvenientlook here old fellow said morris it is a capital idea to have allready in case we want to go horsebacking but dont you think that oneof your snappy carriages with its heraldic adornments in a byway ofwalworth or mile end would attract too much attention for our purposesit seems to me that we ought to take cabs when we go south or east andeven leave them somewhere near the neighbourhood we are going tofriend quincey is right said the professor his head is what youcall in plane with the horizon it is a difficult thing that we go todo and we do not want no peoples to watch us if so it maymina took a growing interest in everything and i was rejoiced to seethat the exigency of affairs was helping her to forget for a time theterrible experience of the night she was very very palealmostghastly and so thin that her lips were drawn away showing her teeth insomewhat of prominence i did not mention this last lest it should giveher needless pain but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think ofwhat had occurred with poor lucy when the count had sucked her blood asyet there was no sign of the teeth growing sharper but the time as yetwas short and there was time for fearwhen we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of thedisposition of our forces there were new sources of doubt it wasfinally agreed that before starting for piccadilly we should destroy thecounts lair close at hand in case he should find it out too soon weshould thus be still ahead of him in our work of destruction and hispresence in his purely material shape and at his weakest might give ussome new clueas to the disposal of forces it was suggested by the professor thatafter our visit to carfax we should all enter the house in piccadillythat the two doctors and i should remain there whilst lord godalmingand quincey found the lairs at walworth and mile end and destroyed themit was possible if not likely the professor urged that the countmight appear in piccadilly during the day and that if so we might beable to cope with him then and there at any rate we might be able tofollow him in force to this plan i strenuously objected and so far asmy going was concerned for i said that i intended to stay and protectmina i thought that my mind was made up on the subject but mina wouldnot listen to my objection she said that there might be some law matterin which i could be useful that amongst the counts papers might besome clue which i could understand out of my experience in transylvaniaand that as it was all the strength we could muster was required tocope with the counts extraordinary power i had to give in for minasresolution was fixed she said that it was the last hope for her thatwe should all work together as for me she said i have no fearthings have been as bad as they can be and whatever may happen musthave in it some element of hope or comfort go my husband god can ifhe wishes it guard me as well alone as with any one present so istarted up crying out then in gods name let us come at once for weare losing time the count may come to piccadilly earlier than wethinknot so said van helsing holding up his handbut why i askeddo you forget he said with actually a smile that last night hebanqueted heavily and will sleep latedid i forget shall i evercan i ever can any of us ever forget thatterrible scene mina struggled hard to keep her brave countenance butthe pain overmastered her and she put her hands before her face andshuddered whilst she moaned van helsing had not intended to recall herfrightful experience he had simply lost sight of her and her part inthe affair in his intellectual effort when it struck him what he saidhe was horrified at his thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her ohmadam mina he said dear dear madam mina alas that i of all who soreverence you should have said anything so forgetful these stupid oldlips of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve so but you willforget it will you not he bent low beside her as he spoke she tookhis hand and looking at him through her tears said hoarselyno i shall not forget for it is well that i remember and with it ihave so much in memory of you that is sweet that i take it alltogether now you must all be going soon breakfast is ready and wemust all eat that we may be strongbreakfast was a strange meal to us all we tried to be cheerful andencourage each other and mina was the brightest and most cheerful ofus when it was over van helsing stood up and saidnow my dear friends we go forth to our terrible enterprise are weall armed as we were on that night when first we visited our enemyslair armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack we all assuredhim then it is well now madam mina you are in any case quite safehere until the sunset and before then we shall returnif we shallreturn but before we go let me see you armed against personal attack ihave myself since you came down prepared your chamber by the placingof things of which we know so that he may not enter now let me guardyourself on your forehead i touch this piece of sacred wafer in thename of the father the son andthere was a fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear as hehad placed the wafer on minas forehead it had seared ithad burnedinto the flesh as though it had been a piece of whitehot metal my poordarlings brain had told her the significance of the fact as quickly asher nerves received the pain of it and the two so overwhelmed her thather overwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream but thewords to her thought came quickly the echo of the scream had not ceasedto ring on the air when there came the reaction and she sank on herknees on the floor in an agony of abasement pulling her beautiful hairover her face as the leper of old his mantle she wailed outunclean unclean even the almighty shuns my polluted flesh i mustbear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the judgment day theyall paused i had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helplessgrief and putting my arms around held her tight for a few minutes oursorrowful hearts beat together whilst the friends around us turned awaytheir eyes that ran tears silently then van helsing turned and saidgravely so gravely that i could not help feeling that he was in someway inspired and was stating things outside himselfit may be that you may have to bear that mark till god himself see fitas he most surely shall on the judgment day to redress all wrongs ofthe earth and of his children that he has placed thereon and oh madammina my dear my dear may we who love you be there to see when thatred scar the sign of gods knowledge of what has been shall pass awayand leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know for so surely aswe live that scar shall pass away when god sees right to lift theburden that is hard upon us till then we bear our cross as his son didin obedience to his will it may be that we are chosen instruments ofhis good pleasure and that we ascend to his bidding as that otherthrough stripes and shame through tears and blood through doubts andfears and all that makes the difference between god and manthere was hope in his words and comfort and they made for resignationmina and i both felt so and simultaneously we each took one of the oldmans hands and bent over and kissed it then without a word we allknelt down together and all holding hands swore to be true to eachother we men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from thehead of her whom each in his own way we loved and we prayed for helpand guidance in the terrible task which lay before usit was then time to start so i said farewell to mina a parting whichneither of us shall forget to our dying day and we set outto one thing i have made up my mind if we find out that mina must be avampire in the end then she shall not go into that unknown and terribleland alone i suppose it is thus that in old times one vampire meantmany just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth sothe holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly rankswe entered carfax without trouble and found all things the same as onthe first occasion it was hard to believe that amongst so prosaicsurroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any ground for suchfear as already we knew had not our minds been made up and had therenot been terrible memories to spur us on we could hardly have proceededwith our task we found no papers or any sign of use in the house andin the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we had seen them lastdr van helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before themand now my friends we have a duty here to do we must sterilise thisearth so sacred of holy memories that he has brought from a fardistant land for such fell use he has chosen this earth because it hasbeen holy thus we defeat him with his own weapon for we make it moreholy still it was sanctified to such use of man now we sanctify it togod as he spoke he took from his bag a screwdriver and a wrench andvery soon the top of one of the cases was thrown open the earth smelledmusty and close but we did not somehow seem to mind for our attentionwas concentrated on the professor taking from his box a piece of thesacred wafer he laid it reverently on the earth and then shutting downthe lid began to screw it home we aiding him as he workedone by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes and leftthem as we had found them to all appearance but in each was a portionof the hostwhen we closed the door behind us the professor said solemnlyso much is already done if it may be that with all the others we canbe so successful then the sunset of this evening may shine on madamminas forehead all white as ivory and with no stainas we passed across the lawn on our way to the station to catch ourtrain we could see the front of the asylum i looked eagerly and in thewindow of my own room saw mina i waved my hand to her and nodded totell that our work there was successfully accomplished she nodded inreply to show that she understood the last i saw she was waving herhand in farewell it was with a heavy heart that we sought the stationand just caught the train which was steaming in as we reached theplatformi have written this in the train                                   piccadilly  oclockjust before we reached fenchurch streetlord godalming said to mequincey and i will find a locksmith you had better not come with us incase there should be any difficulty for under the circumstances itwouldnt seem so bad for us to break into an empty house but you are asolicitor and the incorporated law society might tell you that youshould have known better i demurred as to my not sharing any dangereven of odium but he went on besides it will attract less attentionif there are not too many of us my title will make it all right withthe locksmith and with any policeman that may come along you hadbetter go with jack and the professor and stay in the green parksomewhere in sight of the house and when you see the door opened andthe smith has gone away do you all come across we shall be on thelookout for you and shall let you inthe advice is good said van helsing so we said no more godalmingand morris hurried off in a cab we following in another at the cornerof arlington street our contingent got out and strolled into the greenpark my heart beat as i saw the house on which so much of our hope wascentred looming up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongstits more lively and sprucelooking neighbours we sat down on a benchwithin good view and began to smoke cigars so as to attract as littleattention as possible the minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as wewaited for the coming of the othersat length we saw a fourwheeler drive up out of it in leisurelyfashion got lord godalming and morris and down from the box descendeda thickset working man with his rushwoven basket of tools morris paidthe cabman who touched his hat and drove away together the twoascended the steps and lord godalming pointed out what he wanted donethe workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on one of the spikesof the rail saying something to a policeman who just then saunteredalong the policeman nodded acquiescence and the man kneeling downplaced his bag beside him after searching through it he took out aselection of tools which he produced to lay beside him in orderlyfashion then he stood up looked into the keyhole blew into it andturning to his employers made some remark lord godalming smiled andthe man lifted a goodsized bunch of keys selecting one of them hebegan to probe the lock as if feeling his way with it after fumblingabout for a bit he tried a second and then a third all at once thedoor opened under a slight push from him and he and the two othersentered the hall we sat still my own cigar burnt furiously but vanhelsings went cold altogether we waited patiently as we saw theworkman come out and bring in his bag then he held the door partlyopen steadying it with his knees whilst he fitted a key to the lockthis he finally handed to lord godalming who took out his purse andgave him something the man touched his hat took his bag put on hiscoat and departed not a soul took the slightest notice of the wholetransactionwhen the man had fairly gone we three crossed the street and knocked atthe door it was immediately opened by quincey morris beside whom stoodlord godalming lighting a cigarthe place smells so vilely said the latter as we came in it didindeed smell vilelylike the old chapel at carfaxand with ourprevious experience it was plain to us that the count had been using theplace pretty freely we moved to explore the house all keeping togetherin case of attack for we knew we had a strong and wily enemy to dealwith and as yet we did not know whether the count might not be in thehouse in the diningroom which lay at the back of the hall we foundeight boxes of earth eight boxes only out of the nine which we soughtour work was not over and would never be until we should have found themissing box first we opened the shutters of the window which looked outacross a narrow stoneflagged yard at the blank face of a stablepointed to look like the front of a miniature house there were nowindows in it so we were not afraid of being overlooked we did notlose any time in examining the chests with the tools which we hadbrought with us we opened them one by one and treated them as we hadtreated those others in the old chapel it was evident to us that thecount was not at present in the house and we proceeded to search forany of his effectsafter a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms from basement to atticwe came to the conclusion that the diningroom contained any effectswhich might belong to the count and so we proceeded to minutely examinethem they lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the great diningroomtable there were title deeds of the piccadilly house in a great bundledeeds of the purchase of the houses at mile end and bermondseynotepaper envelopes and pens and ink all were covered up in thinwrapping paper to keep them from the dust there were also a clothesbrush a brush and comb and a jug and basinthe latter containingdirty water which was reddened as if with blood last of all was alittle heap of keys of all sorts and sizes probably those belonging tothe other houses when we had examined this last find lord godalmingand quincey morris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of thehouses in the east and the south took with them the keys in a greatbunch and set out to destroy the boxes in these places the rest of usare with what patience we can waiting their returnor the coming ofthe count octoberthe time seemed terrible long whilst we were waiting forthe coming of godalming and quincey morris the professor tried to keepour minds active by using them all the time i could see his beneficentpurpose by the side glances which he threw from time to time at harkerthe poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is appalling to seelast night he was a frank happylooking man with strong youthfulface full of energy and with dark brown hair today he is a drawnhaggard old man whose white hair matches well with the hollow burningeyes and griefwritten lines of his face his energy is still intact infact he is like a living flame this may yet be his salvation for ifall go well it will tide him over the despairing period he will thenin a kind of way wake again to the realities of life poor fellow ithought my own trouble was bad enough but his the professor knowsthis well enough and is doing his best to keep his mind active what hehas been saying was under the circumstances of absorbing interest sowell as i can remember here it isi have studied over and over again since they came into my hands allthe papers relating to this monster and the more i have studied thegreater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out all through thereare signs of his advance not only of his power but of his knowledge ofit as i learned from the researches of my friend arminus of budapesthhe was in life a most wonderful man soldier statesman andalchemistwhich latter was the highest development of thescienceknowledge of his time he had a mighty brain a learning beyondcompare and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse he dared even toattend the scholomance and there was no branch of knowledge of his timethat he did not essay well in him the brain powers survived thephysical death though it would seem that memory was not all completein some faculties of mind he has been and is only a child but he isgrowing and some things that were childish at the first are now ofmans stature he is experimenting and doing it well and if it had notbeen that we have crossed his path he would be yethe may be yet if wefailthe father or furtherer of a new order of beings whose road mustlead through death not lifeharker groaned and said and this is all arrayed against my darlingbut how is he experimenting the knowledge may help us to defeat himhe has all along since his coming been trying his power slowly butsurely that big childbrain of his is working well for us it is asyet a childbrain for had he dared at the first to attempt certainthings he would long ago have been beyond our power however he meansto succeed and a man who has centuries before him can afford to waitand to go slow festina lente may well be his mottoi fail to understand said harker wearily oh do be more plain tome perhaps grief and trouble are dulling my brainthe professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spokeah my child i will be plain do you not see how of late thismonster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally how he has beenmaking use of the zoöphagous patient to effect his entry into friendjohns home for your vampire though in all afterwards he can come whenand how he will must at the first make entry only when asked thereto byan inmate but these are not his most important experiments do we notsee how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others heknew not then but that must be so but all the time that so greatchildbrain of his was growing and he began to consider whether hemight not himself move the box so he began to help and then when hefound that this be allright he try to move them all alone and so heprogress and he scatter these graves of him and none but he know wherethey are hidden he may have intend to bury them deep in the ground sothat he only use them in the night or at such time as he can change hisform they do him equal well and none may know these are hishidingplace but my child do not despair this knowledge come to himjust too late already all of his lairs but one be sterilise as for himand before the sunset this shall be so then he have no place where hecan move and hide i delayed this morning that so we might be sure isthere not more at stake for us than for him then why we not be evenmore careful than him by my clock it is one hour and already if all bewell friend arthur and quincey are on their way to us today is ourday and we must go sure if slow and lose no chance see there arefive of us when those absent ones returnwhilst he was speaking we were startled by a knock at the hall door thedouble postmans knock of the telegraph boy we all moved out to thehall with one impulse and van helsing holding up his hand to us tokeep silence stepped to the door and opened it the boy handed in adespatch the professor closed the door again and after looking at thedirection opened it and read aloudlook out for d he has just now  come from carfax hurriedly andhastened towards the south he seems to be going the round and may wantto see you minathere was a pause broken by jonathan harkers voicenow god be thanked we shall soon meet van helsing turned to himquickly and saidgod will act in his own way and time do not fear and do not rejoiceas yet for what we wish for at the moment may be our undoingsi care for nothing now he answered hotly except to wipe out thisbrute from the face of creation i would sell my soul to do itoh hush hush my child said van helsing god does not purchasesouls in this wise and the devil though he may purchase does not keepfaith but god is merciful and just and knows your pain and yourdevotion to that dear madam mina think you how her pain would bedoubled did she but hear your wild words do not fear any of us
