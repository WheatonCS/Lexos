cannot measure the depth of them if sympathy and pity canhelp in your affliction wont you let me be of some little serviceforlucys sakein an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief it seemedto me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence found avent at once he grew quite hysterical and raising his open hands beathis palms together in a perfect agony of grief he stood up and then satdown again and the tears rained down his cheeks i felt an infinitepity for him and opened my arms unthinkingly with a sob he laid hishead on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child whilst he shook withemotionwe women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise abovesmaller matters when the motherspirit is invoked i felt this bigsorrowing mans head resting on me as though it were that of the babythat some day may lie on my bosom and i stroked his hair as though hewere my own child i never thought at the time how strange it all wasafter a little bit his sobs ceased and he raised himself with anapology though he made no disguise of his emotion he told me that fordays and nights pastweary days and sleepless nightshe had beenunable to speak with any one as a man must speak in his time ofsorrow there was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him or withwhom owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow wassurrounded he could speak freely i know now how i suffered he saidas he dried his eyes but i do not know even yetand none other canever knowhow much your sweet sympathy has been to me today i shallknow better in time and believe me that though i am not ungratefulnow my gratitude will grow with my understanding you will let me belike a brother will you not for all our livesfor dear lucys sakefor dear lucys sake i said as we clasped hands ay and for yourown sake he added for if a mans esteem and gratitude are ever worththe winning you have won mine today if ever the future should bringto you a time when you need a mans help believe me you will not callin vain god grant that no such time may ever come to you to break thesunshine of your life but if it should ever come promise me that youwill let me know he was so earnest and his sorrow was so fresh thati felt it would comfort him so i saidi promiseas i came along the corridor i saw mr morris looking out of a windowhe turned as he heard my footsteps how is art he said then noticingmy red eyes he went on ah i see you have been comforting him poorold fellow he needs it no one but a woman can help a man when he is introuble of the heart and he had no one to comfort himhe bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him i saw themanuscript in his hand and i knew that when he read it he would realisehow much i knew so i said to himi wish i could comfort all who suffer from the heart will you let mebe your friend and will you come to me for comfort if you need it youwill know later on why i speak he saw that i was in earnest andstooping took my hand and raising it to his lips kissed it it seemedbut poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul and impulsively ibent over and kissed him the tears rose in his eyes and there was amomentary choking in his throat he said quite calmlylittle girl you will never regret that truehearted kindness so longas ever you live then he went into the study to his friendlittle girlthe very words he had used to lucy and oh but heproved himself a friend septemberi got home at five oclock and found that godalmingand morris had not only arrived but had already studied the transcriptof the various diaries and letters which harker and his wonderful wifehad made and arranged harker had not yet returned from his visit to thecarriers men of whom dr hennessey had written to me mrs harker gaveus a cup of tea and i can honestly say that for the first time since ihave lived in it this old house seemed like home when we hadfinished mrs harker saiddr seward may i ask a favour i want to see your patient mrrenfield do let me see him what you have said of him in your diaryinterests me so much she looked so appealing and so pretty that icould not refuse her and there was no possible reason why i should soi took her with me when i went into the room i told the man that alady would like to see him to which he simply answered whyshe is going through the house and wants to see every one in it ianswered oh very well he said let her come in by all means butjust wait a minute till i tidy up the place his method of tidying waspeculiar he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxesbefore i could stop him it was quite evident that he feared or wasjealous of some interference when he had got through his disgustingtask he said cheerfully let the lady come in and sat down on theedge of his bed with his head down but with his eyelids raised so thathe could see her as she entered for a moment i thought that he mighthave some homicidal intent i remembered how quiet he had been justbefore he attacked me in my own study and i took care to stand where icould seize him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her shecame into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once commandthe respect of any lunaticfor easiness is one of the qualities madpeople most respect she walked over to him smiling pleasantly andheld out her handgoodevening mr renfield said she you see i know you for drseward has told me of you he made no immediate reply but eyed her allover intently with a set frown on his face this look gave way to oneof wonder which merged in doubt then to my intense astonishment hesaidyoure not the girl the doctor wanted to marry are you you cant beyou know for shes dead mrs harker smiled sweetly as she repliedoh no i have a husband of my own to whom i was married before i eversaw dr seward or he me i am mrs harkerthen what are you doing heremy husband and i are staying on a visit with dr sewardthen dont staybut why not i thought that this style of conversation might not bepleasant to mrs harker any more than it was to me so i joined inhow did you know i wanted to marry any one his reply was simplycontemptuous given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from mrsharker to me instantly turning them back againwhat an asinine questioni dont see that at all mr renfield said mrs harker at oncechampioning me he replied to her with as much courtesy and respect ashe had shown contempt to meyou will of course understand mrs harker that when a man is soloved and honoured as our host is everything regarding him is ofinterest in our little community dr seward is loved not only by hishousehold and his friends but even by his patients who being some ofthem hardly in mental equilibrium are apt to distort causes andeffects since i myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum icannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmateslean towards the errors of non causa and ignoratio elenchi ipositively opened my eyes at this new development here was my own petlunaticthe most pronounced of his type that i had ever metwithtalking elemental philosophy and with the manner of a polishedgentleman i wonder if it was mrs harkers presence which had touchedsome chord in his memory if this new phase was spontaneous or in anyway due to her unconscious influence she must have some rare gift orpowerwe continued to talk for some time and seeing that he was seeminglyquite reasonable she ventured looking at me questioningly as shebegan to lead him to his favourite topic i was again astonished forhe addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of thecompletest sanity he even took himself as an example when he mentionedcertain thingswhy i myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief indeedit was no wonder that my friends were alarmed and insisted on my beingput under control i used to fancy that life was a positive andperpetual entity and that by consuming a multitude of live things nomatter how low in the scale of creation one might indefinitely prolonglife at times i held the belief so strongly that i actually tried totake human life the doctor here will bear me out that on one occasion itried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers bythe assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of hisbloodrelying of course upon the scriptural phrase for the blood isthe life though indeed the vendor of a certain nostrum hasvulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt isnt that truedoctor i nodded assent for i was so amazed that i hardly knew what toeither think or say it was hard to imagine that i had seen him eat uphis spiders and flies not five minutes before looking at my watch isaw that i should go to the station to meet van helsing so i told mrsharker that it was time to leave she came at once after sayingpleasantly to mr renfield goodbye and i hope i may see you oftenunder auspices pleasanter to yourself to which to my astonishment herepliedgoodbye my dear i pray god i may never see your sweet face againmay he bless and keep youwhen i went to the station to meet van helsing i left the boys behindme poor art seemed more cheerful than he has been since lucy first tookill and quincey is more like his own bright self than he has been formany a long dayvan helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of aboy he saw me at once and rushed up to me sayingah friend john how goes all well so i have been busy for i comehere to stay if need be all affairs are settled with me and i havemuch to tell madam mina is with you yes and her so fine husband andarthur and my friend quincey they are with you too goodas i drove to the house i told him of what had passed and of how my owndiary had come to be of some use through mrs harkers suggestion atwhich the professor interrupted meah that wonderful madam mina she has mans braina brain that a manshould have were he much giftedand a womans heart the good godfashioned her for a purpose believe me when he made that so goodcombination friend john up to now fortune has made that woman of helpto us after tonight she must not have to do with this so terribleaffair it is not good that she run a risk so great we men aredeterminednay are we not pledgedto destroy this monster but it isno part for a woman even if she be not harmed her heart may fail herin so much and so many horrors and hereafter she may sufferboth inwaking from her nerves and in sleep from her dreams and besidesshe is young woman and not so long married there may be other things tothink of some time if not now you tell me she has wrote all then shemust consult with us but tomorrow she say goodbye to this work andwe go alone i agreed heartily with him and then i told him what wehad found in his absence that the house which dracula had bought wasthe very next one to my own he was amazed and a great concern seemedto come on him oh that we had known it before he said for then wemight have reached him in time to save poor lucy however the milkthat is spilt cries not out afterwards as you say we shall not thinkof that but go on our way to the end then he fell into a silence thatlasted till we entered my own gateway before we went to prepare fordinner he said to mrs harkeri am told madam mina by my friend john that you and your husband haveput up in exact order all things that have been up to this momentnot up to this moment professor she said impulsively but up tothis morningbut why not up to now we have seen hitherto how good light all thelittle things have made we have told our secrets and yet no one whohas told is the worse for itmrs harker began to blush and taking a paper from her pockets shesaiddr van helsing will you read this and tell me if it must go in itis my record of today i too have seen the need of putting down atpresent everything however trivial but there is little in this exceptwhat is personal must it go in the professor read it over gravelyand handed it back sayingit need not go in if you do not wish it but i pray that it may it canbut make your husband love you the more and all us your friends morehonour youas well as more esteem and love she took it back withanother blush and a bright smileand so now up to this very hour all the records we have are completeand in order the professor took away one copy to study after dinnerand before our meeting which is fixed for nine oclock the rest of ushave already read everything so when we meet in the study we shall allbe informed as to facts and can arrange our plan of battle with thisterrible and mysterious enemymina harkers journal septemberwhen we met in dr sewards study two hours afterdinner which had been at six oclock we unconsciously formed a sort ofboard or committee professor van helsing took the head of the table towhich dr seward motioned him as he came into the room he made me sitnext to him on his right and asked me to act as secretary jonathan satnext to me opposite us were lord godalming dr seward and mrmorrislord godalming being next the professor and dr seward in thecentre the professor saidi may i suppose take it that we are all acquainted with the factsthat are in these papers we all expressed assent and he went onthen it were i think good that i tell you something of the kind ofenemy with which we have to deal i shall then make known to yousomething of the history of this man which has been ascertained for meso we then can discuss how we shall act and can take our measureaccordingthere are such beings as vampires some of us have evidence that theyexist even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience theteachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sanepeoples i admit that at the first i was sceptic were it not thatthrough long years i have train myself to keep an open mind i could nothave believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear see seei prove i prove alas had i known at the first what now i knownayhad i even guess at himone so precious life had been spared to many ofus who did love her but that is gone and we must so work that otherpoor souls perish not whilst we can save the nosferatu do not dielike the bee when he sting once he is only stronger and beingstronger have yet more power to work evil this vampire which isamongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men he is ofcunning more than mortal for his cunning be the growth of ages he havestill the aids of necromancy which is as his etymology imply thedivination by the dead and all the dead that he can come nigh to arefor him at command he is brute and more than brute he is devil incallous and the heart of him is not he can within limitations appearat will when and where and in any of the forms that are to him hecan within his range direct the elements the storm the fog thethunder he can command all the meaner things the rat and the owl andthe batthe moth and the fox and the wolf he can grow and becomesmall and he can at times vanish and come unknown how then are we tobegin our strike to destroy him how shall we find his where and havingfound it how can we destroy my friends this is much it is a terribletask that we undertake and there may be consequence to make the braveshudder for if we fail in this our fight he must surely win and thenwhere end we life is nothings i heed him not but to fail here is notmere life or death it is that we become as him that we henceforwardbecome foul things of the night like himwithout heart or consciencepreying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best to us forever are the gates of heaven shut for who shall open them to us againwe go on for all time abhorred by all a blot on the face of godssunshine an arrow in the side of him who died for man but we are faceto face with duty and in such case must we shrink for me i say nobut then i am old and life with his sunshine his fair places hissong of birds his music and his love lie far behind you others areyoung some have seen sorrow but there are fair days yet in store whatsay youwhilst he was speaking jonathan had taken my hand i feared oh somuch that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when isaw his hand stretch out but it was life to me to feel its touchsostrong so selfreliant so resolute a brave mans hand can speak foritself it does not even need a womans love to hear its musicwhen the professor had done speaking my husband looked in my eyes and iin his there was no need for speaking between usi answer for mina and myself he saidcount me in professor said mr quincey morris laconically as usuali am with you said lord godalming for lucys sake if for no otherreasondr seward simply nodded the professor stood up and after laying hisgolden crucifix on the table held out his hand on either side i tookhis right hand and lord godalming his left jonathan held my right withhis left and stretched across to mr morris so as we all took hands oursolemn compact was made i felt my heart icy cold but it did not evenoccur to me to draw back we resumed our places and dr van helsingwent on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious workhad begun it was to be taken as gravely and in as businesslike a wayas any other transaction of lifewell you know what we have to contend against but we too are notwithout strength we have on our side power of combinationa powerdenied to the vampire kind we have sources of science we are free toact and think and the hours of the day and the night are ours equallyin fact so far as our powers extend they are unfettered and we arefree to use them we have selfdevotion in a cause and an end toachieve which is not a selfish one these things are muchnow let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us arerestrict and how the individual cannot in fine let us consider thelimitations of the vampire in general and of this one in particularall we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions these do notat the first appear much when the matter is one of life and deathnayof more than either life or death yet must we be satisfied in thefirst place because we have to beno other means is at our controlandsecondly because after all these thingstradition andsuperstitionare everything does not the belief in vampires rest forothersthough not alas for uson them a year ago which of us wouldhave received such a possibility in the midst of our scientificsceptical matteroffact nineteenth century we even scouted a beliefthat we saw justified under our very eyes take it then that thevampire and the belief in his limitations and his cure rest for themoment on the same base for let me tell you he is known everywherethat men have been in old greece in old rome he flourish in germanyall over in france in india even in the chernosese and in china sofar from us in all ways there even is he and the peoples fear him atthis day he have follow the wake of the berserker icelander thedevilbegotten hun the slav the saxon the magyar so far then wehave all we may act upon and let me tell you that very much of thebeliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappyexperience the vampire live on and cannot die by mere passing of thetime he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of theliving even more we have seen amongst us that he can even growyounger that his vital faculties grow strenuous and seem as thoughthey refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty but hecannot flourish without this diet he eat not as others even friendjonathan who lived with him for weeks did never see him to eat neverhe throws no shadow he make in the mirror no reflect as againjonathan observe he has the strength of many of his handwitness againjonathan when he shut the door against the wolfs and when he help himfrom the diligence too he can transform himself to wolf as we gatherfrom the ship arrival in whitby when he tear open the dog he can be asbat as madam mina saw him on the window at whitby and as friend johnsaw him fly from this so near house and as my friend quincey saw him atthe window of miss lucy he can come in mist which he createthat nobleships captain proved him of this but from what we know the distancehe can make this mist is limited and it can only be round himself hecome on moonlight rays as elemental dustas again jonathan saw thosesisters in the castle of dracula he become so smallwe ourselves sawmiss lucy ere she was at peace slip through a hairbreadth space at thetomb door he can when once he find his way come out from anything orinto anything no matter how close it be bound or even fused up withfiresolder you call it he can see in the darkno small power thisin a world which is one half shut from the light ah but hear methrough he can do all these things yet he is not free nay he is evenmore prisoner than the slave of the galley than the madman in his cellhe cannot go where he lists he who is not of nature has yet to obeysome of natures lawswhy we know not he may not enter anywhere at thefirst unless there be some one of the household who bid him to comethough afterwards he can come as he please his power ceases as doesthat of all evil things at the coming of the day only at certain timescan he have limited freedom if he be not at the place whither he isbound he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunsetthese things are we told and in this record of ours we have proof byinference thus whereas he can do as he will within his limit when hehave his earthhome his coffinhome his hellhome the placeunhallowed as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide atwhitby still at other time he can only change when the time come it issaid too that he can only pass running water at the slack or the floodof the tide then there are things which so afflict him that he has nopower as the garlic that we know of and as for things sacred as thissymbol my crucifix that was amongst us even now when we resolve tothem he is nothing but in their presence he take his place far off andsilent with respect there are others too which i shall tell you oflest in our seeking we may need them the branch of wild rose on hiscoffin keep him that he move not from it a sacred bullet fired into thecoffin kill him so that he be true dead and as for the stake throughhim we know already of its peace or the cutoff head that giveth restwe have seen it with our eyesthus when we find the habitation of this manthatwas we can confinehim to his coffin and destroy him if we obey what we know but he isclever i have asked my friend arminius of budapesth university tomake his record and from all the means that are he tell me of what hehas been he must indeed have been that voivode dracula who won hisname against the turk over the great river on the very frontier ofturkeyland if it be so then was he no common man for in that timeand for centuries after he was spoken of as the cleverest and the mostcunning as well as the bravest of the sons of the land beyond theforest that mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to hisgrave and are even now arrayed against us the draculas were saysarminius a great and noble race though now and again were scions whowere held by their coevals to have had dealings with the evil one theylearned his secrets in the scholomance amongst the mountains over lakehermanstadt where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due in therecords are such words as stregoicawitch ordog andpokolsatan and hell and in one manuscript this very dracula isspoken of as wampyr which we all understand too well there have beenfrom the loins of this very one great men and good women and theirgraves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell for itis not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep inall good in soil barren of holy memories it cannot restwhilst they were talking mr morris was looking steadily at the windowand he now got up quietly and went out of the room there was a littlepause and then the professor went onand now we must settle what we do we have here much data and we mustproceed to lay out our campaign we know from the inquiry of jonathanthat from the castle to whitby came fifty boxes of earth all of whichwere delivered at carfax we also know that at least some of these boxeshave been removed it seems to me that our first step should be toascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wallwhere we look today or whether any more have been removed if thelatter we must tracehere we were interrupted in a very startling way outside the house camethe sound of a pistolshot the glass of the window was shattered with abullet which ricochetting from the top of the embrasure struck thefar wall of the room i am afraid i am at heart a coward for i shriekedout the men all jumped to their feet lord godalming flew over to thewindow and threw up the sash as he did so we heard mr morriss voicewithoutsorry i fear i have alarmed you i shall come in and tell you aboutit a minute later he came in and saidit was an idiotic thing of me to do and i ask your pardon mrsharker most sincerely i fear i must have frightened you terribly butthe fact is that whilst the professor was talking there came a big batand sat on the windowsill i have got such a horror of the damnedbrutes from recent events that i cannot stand them and i went out tohave a shot as i have been doing of late of evenings whenever i haveseen one you used to laugh at me for it then artdid you hit it asked dr van helsingi dont know i fancy not for it flew away into the wood withoutsaying any more he took his seat and the professor began to resume hisstatementwe must trace each of these boxes and when we are ready we musteither capture or kill this monster in his lair or we must so tospeak sterilise the earth so that no more he can seek safety in itthus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the hours ofnoon and sunset and so engage with him when he is at his most weakand now for you madam mina this night is the end until all be wellyou are too precious to us to have such risk when we part tonight youno more must question we shall tell you all in good time we are menand are able to bear but you must be our star and our hope and weshall act all the more free that you are not in the danger such as weareall the men even jonathan seemed relieved but it did not seem to megood that they should brave danger and perhaps lessen theirsafetystrength being the best safetythrough care of me but theirminds were made up and though it was a bitter pill for me to swallowi could say nothing save to accept their chivalrous care of memr morris resumed the discussionas there is no time to lose i vote we have a look at his house rightnow time is everything with him and swift action on our part may saveanother victimi own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came soclose but i did not say anything for i had a greater fear that if iappeared as a drag or a hindrance to their work they might even leaveme out of their counsels altogether they have now gone off to carfaxwith means to get into the housemanlike they had told me to go to bed and sleep as if a woman cansleep when those she loves are in danger i shall lie down and pretendto sleep lest jonathan have added anxiety about me when he returnsdr sewards diary october  a mjust as we were about to leave the house anurgent message was brought to me from renfield to know if i would seehim at once as he had something of the utmost importance to say to mei told the messenger to say that i would attend to his wishes in themorning i was busy just at the moment the attendant addedhe seems very importunate sir i have never seen him so eager i dontknow but what if you dont see him soon he will have one of hisviolent fits i knew the man would not have said this without somecause so i said all right ill go now and i asked the others towait a few minutes for me as i had to go and see my patienttake me with you friend john said the professor his case in yourdiary interest me much and it had bearing too now and again on ourcase i should much like to see him and especial when his mind isdisturbedmay i come also asked lord godalmingme too said quincey morris may i come said harker i nodded andwe all went down the passage togetherwe found him in a state of considerable excitement but far morerational in his speech and manner than i had ever seen him there was anunusual understanding of himself which was unlike anything i had evermet with in a lunatic and he took it for granted that his reasons wouldprevail with others entirely sane we all four went into the room butnone of the others at first said anything his request was that i wouldat once release him from the asylum and send him home this he backed upwith arguments regarding his complete recovery and adduced his ownexisting sanity i appeal to your friends he said they willperhaps not mind sitting in judgment on my case by the way you havenot introduced me i was so much astonished that the oddness ofintroducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment andbesides there was a certain dignity in the mans manner so much ofthe habit of equality that i at once made the introduction lordgodalming professor van helsing mr quincey morris of texas mrrenfield he shook hands with each of them saying in turnlord godalming i had the honour of seconding your father at thewindham i grieve to know by your holding the title that he is nomore he was a man loved and honoured by all who knew him and in hisyouth was i have heard the inventor of a burnt rum punch muchpatronised on derby night mr morris you should be proud of your greatstate its reception into the union was a precedent which may havefarreaching effects hereafter when the pole and the tropics may holdalliance to the stars and stripes the power of treaty may yet prove avast engine of enlargement when the monroe doctrine takes its trueplace as a political fable what shall any man say of his pleasure atmeeting van helsing sir i make no apology for dropping all forms ofconventional prefix when an individual has revolutionised therapeuticsby his discovery of the continuous evolution of brainmatterconventional forms are unfitting since they would seem to limit him toone of a class you gentlemen who by nationality by heredity or bythe possession of natural gifts are fitted to hold your respectiveplaces in the moving world i take to witness that i am as sane as atleast the majority of men who are in full possession of their libertiesand i am sure that you dr seward humanitarian and medicojurist aswell as scientist will deem it a moral duty to deal with me as one tobe considered as under exceptional circumstances he made this lastappeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without its owncharmi think we were all staggered for my own part i was under theconviction despite my knowledge of the mans character and historythat his reason had been restored and i felt under a strong impulse totell him that i was satisfied as to his sanity and would see about thenecessary formalities for his release in the morning i thought itbetter to wait however before making so grave a statement for of oldi knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liableso i contented myself with making a general statement that he appearedto be improving very rapidly that i would have a longer chat with himin the morning and would then see what i could do in the direction ofmeeting his wishes this did not at all satisfy him for he saidquicklybut i fear dr seward that you hardly apprehend my wish i desire togo at onceherenowthis very hourthis very moment if i may timepresses and in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it is ofthe essence of the contract i am sure it is only necessary to putbefore so admirable a practitioner as dr seward so simple yet somomentous a wish to ensure its fulfilment he looked at me keenly andseeing the negative in my face turned to the others and scrutinisedthem closely not meeting any sufficient response he went onis it possible that i have erred in my suppositionyou have i said frankly but at the same time as i felt brutallythere was a considerable pause and then he said slowlythen i suppose i must only shift my ground of request let me ask forthis concessionboon privilege what you will i am content to implorein such a case not on personal grounds but for the sake of others iam not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons but you may iassure you take it from me that they are good ones sound andunselfish and spring from the highest sense of duty could you looksir into my heart you would approve to the full the sentiments whichanimate me nay more you would count me amongst the best and truest ofyour friends again he looked at us all keenly i had a growingconviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method wasbut yet another form or phase of his madness and so determined to lethim go on a little longer knowing from experience that he would likeall lunatics give himself away in the end van helsing was gazing athim with a look of utmost intensity his bushy eyebrows almost meetingwith the fixed concentration of his look he said to renfield in a tonewhich did not surprise me at the time but only when i thought of itafterwardsfor it was as of one addressing an equalcan you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be freetonight i will undertake that if you will satisfy even mea strangerwithout prejudice and with the habit of keeping an open minddrseward will give you at his own risk and on his own responsibility theprivilege you seek he shook his head sadly and with a look ofpoignant regret on his face the professor went oncome sir bethink yourself you claim the privilege of reason in thehighest degree since you seek to impress us with your completereasonableness you do this whose sanity we have reason to doubt sinceyou are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect ifyou will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course how canwe perform the duty which you yourself put upon us be wise and helpus and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish he still shookhis head as he saiddr van helsing i have nothing to say your argument is complete andif i were free to speak i should not hesitate a moment but i am not myown master in the matter i can only ask you to trust me if i amrefused the responsibility does not rest with me i thought it was nowtime to end the scene which was becoming too comically grave so i wenttowards the door simply sayingcome my friends we have work to do goodnightas however i got near the door a new change came over the patient hemoved towards me so quickly that for the moment i feared that he wasabout to make another homicidal attack my fears however weregroundless for he held up his two hands imploringly and made hispetition in a moving manner as he saw that the very excess of hisemotion was militating against him by restoring us more to our oldrelations he became still more demonstrative i glanced at van helsingand saw my conviction reflected in his eyes so i became a little morefixed in my manner if not more stern and motioned to him that hisefforts were unavailing i had previously seen something of the sameconstantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request ofwhich at the time he had thought much such for instance as when hewanted a cat and i was prepared to see the collapse into the samesullen acquiescence on this occasion my expectation was not realisedfor when he found that his appeal would not be successful he got intoquite a frantic condition he threw himself on his knees and held uphis hands wringing them in plaintive supplication and poured forth atorrent of entreaty with the tears rolling down his cheeks and hiswhole face and form expressive of the deepest emotionlet me entreat you dr seward oh let me implore you to let me outof this house at once send me away how you will and where you willsend keepers with me with whips and chains let them take me in astraitwaistcoat manacled and legironed even to a gaol but let me goout of this you dont know what you do by keeping me here i amspeaking from the depths of my heartof my very soul you dont knowwhom you wrong or how and i may not tell woe is me i may not tellby all you hold sacredby all you hold dearby your love that islostby your hope that livesfor the sake of the almighty take me outof this and save my soul from guilt cant you hear me man cant youunderstand will you never learn dont you know that i am sane andearnest now that i am no lunatic in a mad fit but a sane man fightingfor his soul oh hear me hear me let me go let me go let me goi thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get and sowould bring on a fit so i took him by the hand and raised him upcome i said sternly no more of this we have had quite enoughalready get to your bed and try to behave more discreetlyhe suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments thenwithout a word he rose and moving over sat down on the side of thebed the collapse had come as on former occasion just as i hadexpectedwhen i was leaving the room last of our party he said to me in aquiet wellbred voiceyou will i trust dr seward do me the justice to bear in mind lateron that i did what i could to convince you tonight october  a mi went with the party to the search with an easymind for i think i never saw mina so absolutely strong and well i amso glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the worksomehow it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business atall but now that her work is done and that it is due to her energy andbrains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such a waythat every point tells she may well feel that her part is finished andthat she can henceforth leave the rest to us we were i think all alittle upset by the scene with mr renfield when we came away from hisroom we were silent till we got back to the study then mr morris saidto dr sewardsay jack if that man wasnt attempting a bluff he is about thesanest lunatic i ever saw im not sure but i believe that he had someserious purpose and if he had it was pretty rough on him not to get achance lord godalming and i were silent but dr van helsing addedfriend john you know more of lunatics than i do and im glad of itfor i fear that if it had been to me to decide i would before that lasthysterical outburst have given him free but we live and learn and inour present task we must take no chance as my friend quincey would sayall is best as they are dr seward seemed to answer them both in adreamy kind of wayi dont know but that i agree with you if that man had been anordinary lunatic i would have taken my chance of trusting him but heseems so mixed up with the count in an indexy kind of way that i amafraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads i cant forget howhe prayed with almost equal fervour for a cat and then tried to tear mythroat out with his teeth besides he called the count lord andmaster and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical waythat horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to helphim so i suppose he isnt above trying to use a respectable lunatic hecertainly did seem earnest though i only hope we have done what isbest these things in conjunction with the wild work we have in handhelp to unnerve a man the professor stepped over and laying his handon his shoulder said in his grave kindly wayfriend john have no fear we are trying to do our duty in a very sadand terrible case we can only do as we deem best what else have we tohope for except the pity of the good god lord godalming had slippedaway for a few minutes but now he returned he held up a little silverwhistle as he remarkedthat old place may be full of rats and if so ive got an antidote oncall having passed the wall we took our way to the house taking careto keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shoneout when we got to the porch the professor opened his bag and took outa lot of things which he laid on the step sorting them into fourlittle groups evidently one for each then he spokemy friends we are going into a terrible danger and we need arms ofmany kinds our enemy is not merely spiritual remember that he has thestrength of twenty men and that though our necks or our windpipes areof the common kindand therefore breakable or crushablehis are notamenable to mere strength a stronger man or a body of men more strongin all than him can at certain times hold him but they cannot hurt himas we can be hurt by him we must therefore guard ourselves from histouch keep this near your heartas he spoke he lifted a little silvercrucifix and held it out to me i being nearest to himput theseflowers round your neckhere he handed to me a wreath of witheredgarlic blossomsfor other enemies more mundane this revolver and thisknife and for aid in all these so small electric lamps which you canfasten to your breast and for all and above all at the last thiswhich we must not desecrate needless this was a portion of sacredwafer which he put in an envelope and handed to me each of the otherswas similarly equipped now he said friend john where are theskeleton keys if so that we can open the door we need not break houseby the window as before at miss lucysdr seward tried one or two skeleton keys his mechanical dexterity as asurgeon standing him in good stead presently he got one to suit aftera little play back and forward the bolt yielded and with a rustyclang shot back we pressed on the door the rusty hinges creaked andit slowly opened it was startlingly like the image conveyed to me indr sewards diary of the opening of miss westenras tomb i fancy thatthe same idea seemed to strike the others for with one accord theyshrank back the professor was the first to move forward and steppedinto the open doorin manus tuas domine he said crossing himself as he passed overthe threshold we closed the door behind us lest when we should havelit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road theprofessor carefully tried the lock lest we might not be able to open itfrom within should we be in a hurry making our exit then we all lit ourlamps and proceeded on our searchthe light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms as therays crossed each other or the opacity of our bodies threw greatshadows i could not for my life get away from the feeling that therewas some one else amongst us i suppose it was the recollection sopowerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings of that terribleexperience in transylvania i think the feeling was common to us allfor i noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at everysound and every new shadow just as i felt myself doingthe whole place was thick with dust the floor was seemingly inchesdeep except where there were recent footsteps in which on holding downmy lamp i could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked thewalls were fluffy and heavy with dust and in the corners were masses ofspiders webs whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like oldtattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down on a table in thehall was a great bunch of keys with a timeyellowed label on each theyhad been used several times for on the table were several similar rentsin the blanket of dust similar to that exposed when the professorlifted them he turned to me and saidyou know this place jonathan you have copied maps of it and you knowit at least more than we do which is the way to the chapel i had anidea of its direction though on my former visit i had not been able toget admission to it so i led the way and after a few wrong turningsfound myself opposite a low arched oaken door ribbed with iron bandsthis is the spot said the professor as he turned his lamp on a smallmap of the house copied from the file of my original correspondenceregarding the purchase with a little trouble we found the key on thebunch and opened the door we were prepared for some unpleasantness foras we were opening the door a faint malodorous air seemed to exhalethrough the gaps but none of us ever expected such an odour as weencountered none of the others had met the count at all at closequarters and when i had seen him he was either in the fasting stage ofhis existence in his rooms or when he was gloated with fresh blood ina ruined building open to the air but here the place was small andclose and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul there wasan earthy smell as of some dry miasma which came through the foulerair but as to the odour itself how shall i describe it it was notalone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with thepungent acrid smell of blood but it seemed as though corruption hadbecome itself corrupt faugh it sickens me to think of it every breathexhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place andintensified its loathsomenessunder ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought ourenterprise to an end but this was no ordinary case and the high andterrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which roseabove merely physical considerations after the involuntary shrinkingconsequent on the first nauseous whiff we one and all set about ourwork as though that loathsome place were a garden of roseswe made an accurate examination of the place the professor saying as webeganthe first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left we must thenexamine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get someclue as to what has become of the rest a glance was sufficient to showhow many remained for the great earth chests were bulky and there wasno mistaking themthere were only twentynine left out of the fifty once i got a frightfor seeing lord godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulteddoor into the dark passage beyond i looked too and for an instant myheart stood still somewhere looking out from the shadow i seemed tosee the high lights of the counts evil face the ridge of the nose thered eyes the red lips the awful pallor it was only for a moment foras lord godalming said i thought i saw a face but it was only theshadows and resumed his inquiry i turned my lamp in the directionand stepped into the passage there was no sign of any one and as therewere no corners no doors no aperture of any kind but only the solidwalls of the passage there could be no hidingplace even for him itook it that fear had helped imagination and said nothinga few minutes later i saw morris step suddenly back from a corner whichhe was examining we all followed his movements with our eyes forundoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us and we saw a whole massof phosphorescence which twinkled like stars we all instinctively drewback the whole place was becoming alive with ratsfor a moment or two we stood appalled all save lord godalming who wasseemingly prepared for such an emergency rushing over to the greatironbound oaken door which dr seward had described from the outsideand which i had seen myself he turned the key in the lock drew thehuge bolts and swung the door open then taking his little silverwhistle from his pocket he blew a low shrill call it was answeredfrom behind dr sewards house by the yelping of dogs and after about aminute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the houseunconsciously we had all moved towards the door and as we moved inoticed that the dust had been much disturbed the boxes which had beentaken out had been brought this way but even in the minute that hadelapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased they seemed toswarm over the place all at once till the lamplight shining on theirmoving dark bodies and glittering baleful eyes made the place looklike a bank of earth set with fireflies the dogs dashed on but at thethreshold suddenly stopped and snarled and then simultaneously liftingtheir noses began to howl in most lugubrious fashion the rats weremultiplying in thousands and we moved outlord godalming lifted one of the dogs and carrying him in placed himon the floor the instant his feet touched the ground he seemed torecover his courage and rushed at his natural enemies they fled beforehim so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score the otherdogs who had by now been lifted in the same manner had but small preyere the whole mass had vanishedwith their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed forthe dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts attheir prostrate foes and turned them over and over and tossed them inthe air with vicious shakes we all seemed to find our spirits risewhether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening ofthe chapel door or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselvesin the open i know not but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed toslip from us like a robe and the occasion of our coming lost somethingof its grim significance though we did not slacken a whit in ourresolution we closed the outer door and barred and locked it andbringing the dogs with us began our search of the house we foundnothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions and alluntouched save for my own footsteps when i had made my first visitnever once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness and even whenwe returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had beenrabbithunting in a summer woodthe morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the frontdr van helsing had taken the key of the halldoor from the bunch andlocked the door in orthodox fashion putting the key into his pocketwhen he had doneso far he said our night has been eminently successful no harm hascome to us such as i feared might be and yet we have ascertained howmany boxes are missing more than all do i rejoice that this ourfirstand perhaps our most difficult and dangerousstep has beenaccomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet madam mina ortroubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds andsmells of horror which she might never forget one lesson too we havelearned if it be allowable to argue a particulari that the brutebeasts which are to the counts command are yet themselves not amenableto his spiritual power for look these rats that would come to hiscall just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going andto that poor mothers cry though they come to him they run pellmellfrom the so little dogs of my friend arthur we have other mattersbefore us other dangers other fears and that monsterhe has not usedhis power over the brute world for the only or the last time tonightso be it that he has gone elsewhere good it has given us opportunityto cry check in some ways in this chess game which we play for thestake of human souls and now let us go home the dawn is close at handand we have reason to be content with our first nights work it may beordained that we have many nights and days to follow if full of perilbut we must go on and from no danger shall we shrinkthe house was silent when we got back save for some poor creature whowas screaming away in one of the distant wards and a low moaning soundfrom renfields room the poor wretch was doubtless torturing himselfafter the manner of the insane with needless thoughts of paini came tiptoe into our own room and found mina asleep breathing sosoftly that i had to put my ear down to hear it she looks paler thanusual i hope the meeting tonight has not upset her i am trulythankful that she is to be left out of our future work and even of ourdeliberations it is too great a strain for a woman to bear i did notthink so at first but i know better now therefore i am glad that it issettled there may be things which would frighten her to hear and yetto conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once shesuspected that there was any concealment henceforth our work is to be asealed book to her till at least such time as we can tell her that allis finished and the earth free from a monster of the nether world idaresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after suchconfidence as ours but i must be resolute and tomorrow i shall keepdark over tonights doings and shall refuse to speak of anything thathas happened i rest on the sofa so as not to disturb her                                    october lateri suppose it was natural that we should have alloverslept ourselves for the day was a busy one and the night had norest at all even mina must have felt its exhaustion for though i slepttill the sun was high i was awake before her and had to call two orthree times before she awoke indeed she was so sound asleep that for afew seconds she did not recognize me but looked at me with a sort ofblank terror as one looks who has been waked out of a bad dream shecomplained a little of being tired and i let her rest till later in theday we now know of twentyone boxes having been removed and if it bethat several were taken in any of these removals we may be able to tracethem all such will of course immensely simplify our labour and thesooner the matter is attended to the better i shall look up thomassnelling todaydr sewards diary octoberit was towards noon when i was awakened by the professorwalking into my room he was more jolly and cheerful than usual and itis quite evident that last nights work has helped to take some of thebrooding weight off his mind after going over the adventure of thenight he suddenly saidyour patient interests me much may it be that with you i visit himthis morning or if that you are too occupy i can go alone if it maybe it is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophyand reason so sound i had some work to do which pressed so i told himthat if he would go alone i would be glad as then i should not have tokeep him waiting so i called an attendant and gave him the necessaryinstructions before the professor left the room i cautioned him againstgetting any false impression from my patient but he answered iwant him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming livethings he said to madam mina as i see in your diary of yesterday thathe had once had such a belief why do you smile friend johnexcuse me i said but the answer is here i laid my hand on thetypewritten matter when our sane and learned lunatic made that verystatement of how he used to consume life his mouth was actuallynauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before mrsharker entered the room van helsing smiled in turn good he saidyour memory is true friend john i should have remembered and yet itis this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental diseasesuch a fascinating study perhaps i may gain more knowledge out of thefolly of this madman than i shall from the teaching of the most wisewho knows i went on with my work and before long was through that inhand it seemed that the time had been very short indeed but there wasvan helsing back in the study do i interrupt he asked politely as hestood at the doornot at all i answered come in my work is finished and i am freei can go with you now if you likeit is needless i have seen himwelli fear that he does not appraise me at much our interview was shortwhen i entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre withhis elbows on his knees and his face was the picture of sullendiscontent i spoke to him as cheerfully as i could and with such ameasure of respect as i could assume he made no reply whatever dontyou know me i asked his answer was not reassuring i know you wellenough you are the old fool van helsing i wish you would take yourselfand your idiotic brain theories somewhere else damn all thickheadeddutchmen not a word more would he say but sat in his implacablesullenness as indifferent to me as though i had not been in the room atall thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from this soclever lunatic so i shall go if i may and cheer myself with a fewhappy words with that sweet soul madam mina friend john it doesrejoice me unspeakable that she is no more to be pained no more to beworried with our terrible things though we shall much miss her help itis better soi agree with you with all my heart i answered earnestly for i didnot want him to weaken in this matter mrs harker is better out of itthings are quite bad enough for us all men of the world and who havebeen in many tight places in our time but it is no place for a womanand if she had remained in touch with the affair it would in timeinfallibly have wrecked herso van helsing has gone to confer with mrs harker and harker quinceyand art are all out following up the clues as to the earthboxes ishall finish my round of work and we shall meet tonightmina harkers journal octoberit is strange to me to be kept in the dark as i am todayafter jonathans full confidence for so many years to see himmanifestly avoid certain matters and those the most vital of all thismorning i slept late after the fatigues of yesterday and thoughjonathan was late too he was the earlier he spoke to me before he wentout never more sweetly or tenderly but he never mentioned a word ofwhat had happened in the visit to the counts house and yet he musthave known how terribly anxious i was poor dear fellow i suppose itmust have distressed him even more than it did me they all agreed thatit was best that i should not be drawn further into this awful work andi acquiesced but to think that he keeps anything from me and now i amcrying like a silly fool when i know it comes from my husbands greatlove and from the good good wishes of those other strong menthat has done me good well some day jonathan will tell me all andlest it should ever be that he should think for a moment that i keptanything from him i still keep my journal as usual then if he hasfeared of my trust i shall show it to him with every thought of myheart put down for his dear eyes to read i feel strangely sad andlowspirited today i suppose it is the reaction from the terribleexcitementlast night i went to bed when the men had gone simply because they toldme to i didnt feel sleepy and i did feel full of devouring anxiety ikept thinking over everything that has been ever since jonathan came tosee me in london and it all seems like a horrible tragedy with fatepressing on relentlessly to some destined end everything that one doesseems no matter how right it may be to bring on the very thing whichis most to be deplored if i hadnt gone to whitby perhaps poor dearlucy would be with us now she hadnt taken to visiting the churchyardtill i came and if she hadnt come there in the daytime with me shewouldnt have walked there in her sleep and if she hadnt gone there atnight and asleep that monster couldnt have destroyed her as he didoh why did i ever go to whitby there now crying again i wonder whathas come over me today i must hide it from jonathan for if he knewthat i had been crying twice in one morningi who never cried on myown account and whom he has never caused to shed a tearthe dearfellow would fret his heart out i shall put a bold face on and if i dofeel weepy he shall never see it i suppose it is one of the lessonsthat we poor women have to learni cant quite remember how i fell asleep last night i remember hearingthe sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds like prayingon a very tumultuous scale from mr renfields room which is somewhereunder this and then there was silence over everything silence soprofound that it startled me and i got up and looked out of the windowall was dark and silent the black shadows thrown by the moonlightseeming full of a silent mystery of their own not a thing seemed to bestirring but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate so that a thinstreak of white mist that crept with almost imperceptible slownessacross the grass towards the house seemed to have a sentience and avitality of its own i think that the digression of my thoughts musthave done me good for when i got back to bed i found a lethargycreeping over me i lay a while but could not quite sleep so i got outand looked out of the window again the mist was spreading and was nowclose up to the house so that i could see it lying thick against thewall as though it were stealing up to the windows the poor man wasmore loud than ever and though i could not distinguish a word he saidi could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty onhis part then there was the sound of a struggle and i knew that theattendants were dealing with him i was so frightened that i crept intobed and pulled the clothes over my head putting my fingers in my earsi was not then a bit sleepy at least so i thought but i must havefallen asleep for except dreams i do not remember anything until themorning when jonathan woke me i think that it took me an effort and alittle time to realise where i was and that it was jonathan who wasbending over me my dream was very peculiar and was almost typical ofthe way that waking thoughts become merged in or continued in dreamsi thought that i was asleep and waiting for jonathan to come back iwas very anxious about him and i was powerless to act my feet and myhands and my brain were weighted so that nothing could proceed at theusual pace and so i slept uneasily and thought then it began to dawnupon me that the air was heavy and dank and cold i put back theclothes from my face and found to my surprise that all was dimaround the gaslight which i had left lit for jonathan but turned downcame only like a tiny red spark through the fog which had evidentlygrown thicker and poured into the room then it occurred to me that ihad shut the window before i had come to bed i would have got out tomake certain on the point but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain mylimbs and even my will i lay still and endured that was all i closedmy eyes but could still see through my eyelids it is wonderful whattricks our dreams play us and how conveniently we can imagine themist grew thicker and thicker and i could see now how it came in for icould see it like smokeor with the white energy of boilingwaterpouring in not through the window but through the joinings ofthe door it got thicker and thicker till it seemed as if it becameconcentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room through the topof which i could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye thingsbegan to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was nowwhirling in the room and through it all came the scriptural words apillar of cloud by day and of fire by night was it indeed some suchspiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep but the pillar wascomposed of both the day and the nightguiding for the fire was in thered eye which at the thought got a new fascination for me till as ilooked the fire divided and seemed to shine on me through the fog liketwo red eyes such as lucy told me of in her momentary mental wanderingwhen on the cliff the dying sunlight struck the windows of st maryschurch suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that jonathanhad seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mistin the moonlight and in my dream i must have fainted for all becameblack darkness the last conscious effort which imagination made was toshow me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist i must becareful of such dreams for they would unseat ones reason if there weretoo much of them i would get dr van helsing or dr seward to prescribesomething for me which would make me sleep only that i fear to alarmthem such a dream at the present time would become woven into theirfears for me tonight i shall strive hard to sleep naturally if i donot i shall tomorrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral thatcannot hurt me for once and it will give me a good nights sleep lastnight tired me more than if i had not slept at all                                    october  p mlast night i slept but did not dream i must haveslept soundly for i was not waked by jonathan coming to bed but thesleep has not refreshed me for today i feel terribly weak andspiritless i spent all yesterday trying to read or lying down dozingin the afternoon mr renfield asked if he might see me poor man he wasvery gentle and when i came away he kissed my hand and bade god blessme some way it affected me much i am crying when i think of him thisis a new weakness of which i must be careful jonathan would bemiserable if he knew i had been crying he and the others were out tilldinnertime and they all came in tired i did what i could to brightenthem up and i suppose that the effort did me good for i forgot howtired i was after dinner they sent me to bed and all went off to smoketogether as they said but i knew that they wanted to tell each otherof what had occurred to each during the day i could see from jonathansmanner that he had something important to communicate i was not sosleepy as i should have been so before they went i asked dr seward togive me a little opiate of some kind as i had not slept well the nightbefore he very kindly made me up a sleeping draught which he gave tome telling me that it would do me no harm as it was very mild ihave taken it and am waiting for sleep which still keeps aloof i hopei have not done wrong for as sleep begins to flirt with me a new fearcomes that i may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of thepower of waking i might want it here comes sleep goodnight october eveningi found thomas snelling in his house at bethnalgreen but unhappily he was not in a condition to remember anything thevery prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him hadproved too much and he had begun too early on his expected debauch ilearned however from his wife who seemed a decent poor soul that hewas only the assistant to smollet who of the two mates was theresponsible person so off i drove to walworth and found mr josephsmollet at home and in his shirtsleeves taking a late tea out of asaucer he is a decent intelligent fellow distinctly a good reliabletype of workman and with a headpiece of his own he remembered allabout the incident of the boxes and from a wonderful dogsearednotebook which he produced from some mysterious receptacle about theseat of his trousers and which had hieroglyphical entries in thickhalfobliterated pencil he gave me the destinations of the boxes therewere he said six in the cartload which he took from carfax and left at chicksand street mile end new town and another six which hedeposited at jamaica lane bermondsey if then the count meant toscatter these ghastly refuges of his over london these places werechosen as the first of delivery so that later he might distribute morefully the systematic manner in which this was done made me think thathe could not mean to confine himself to two sides of london he was nowfixed on the far east of the northern shore on the east of the southernshore and on the south the north and west were surely never meant tobe left out of his diabolical schemelet alone the city itself and thevery heart of fashionable london in the southwest and west i went backto smollet and asked him if he could tell us if any other boxes hadbeen taken from carfaxhe repliedwell guvnor youve treated me wery ansomei had given him half asovereignan ill tell yer all i know i heard a man by the name ofbloxam say four nights ago in the are an ounds in pinchers alleyas ow he an his mate ad ad a rare dusty job in a old ouse atpurfect there aint amany such jobs as this ere an im thinkinthat maybe sam bloxam could tell ye summut i asked if he could tell mewhere to find him i told him that if he could get me the address itwould be worth another halfsovereign to him so he gulped down the restof his tea and stood up saying that he was going to begin the searchthen and there at the door he stopped and saidlook ere guvnor there aint no sense in me akeepin you ere imay find sam soon or i maynt but anyhow he aint like to be in a wayto tell ye much tonight sam is a rare one when he starts on the boozeif you can give me a envelope with a stamp on it and put yer address onit ill find out where sam is to be found and post it ye tonight butyed better be up arter im soon in the mornin or maybe ye wont ketchim for sam gets off main early never mind the booze the night aforethis was all practical so one of the children went off with a penny tobuy an envelope and a sheet of paper and to keep the change when shecame back i addressed the envelope and stamped it and when smollet hadagain faithfully promised to post the address when found i took my wayto home were on the track anyhow i am tired tonight and want sleepmina is fast asleep and looks a little too pale her eyes look asthough she had been crying poor dear ive no doubt it frets her to bekept in the dark and it may make her doubly anxious about me and theothers but it is best as it is it is better to be disappointed andworried in such a way now than to have her nerve broken the doctorswere quite right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadfulbusiness i must be firm for on me this particular burden of silencemust rest i shall not ever enter on the subject with her under anycircumstances indeed it may not be a hard task after all for sheherself has become reticent on the subject and has not spoken of thecount or his doings ever since we told her of our decision                                    october eveninga long and trying and exciting day by the firstpost i got my directed envelope with a dirty scrap of paper enclosed onwhich was written with a carpenters pencil in a sprawling handsam bloxam korkrans  poters cort bartel street walworth arsk forthe depitei got the letter in bed and rose without waking mina she looked heavyand sleepy and pale and far from well i determined not to wake herbut that when i should return from this new search i would arrange forher going back to exeter i think she would be happier in our own homewith her daily tasks to interest her than in being here amongst us andin ignorance i only saw dr seward for a moment and told him where iwas off to promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as i shouldhave found out anything i drove to walworth and found with somedifficulty potters court mr smollets spelling misled me as i askedfor poters court instead of potters court however when i had foundthe court i had no difficulty in discovering corcorans lodginghousewhen i asked the man who came to the door for the depite he shook hishead and said i dunno im there aint no such a person ere i nevereard of im in all my bloomin days dont believe there aint nobodyof that kind livin ere or anywheres i took out smollets letter andas i read it it seemed to me that the lesson of the spelling of the nameof the court might guide me what are you i askedim the depity he answered i saw at once that i was on the righttrack phonetic spelling had again misled me a halfcrown tip put thedeputys knowledge at my disposal and i learned that mr bloxam whohad slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night atcorcorans had left for his work at poplar at five oclock thatmorning he could not tell me where the place of work was situated buthe had a vague idea that it was some kind of a newfangled wareusand with this slender clue i had to start for poplar it was twelveoclock before i got any satisfactory hint of such a building and thisi got at a coffeeshop where some workmen were having their dinner oneof these suggested that there was being erected at cross angel street anew cold storage building and as this suited the condition of anewfangled wareus i at once drove to it an interview with a surlygatekeeper and a surlier foreman both of whom were appeased with thecoin of the realm put me on the track of bloxam he was sent for on mysuggesting that i was willing to pay his days wages to his foreman forthe privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter he wasa smart enough fellow though rough of speech and bearing when i hadpromised to pay for his information and given him an earnest he told methat he had made two journeys between carfax and a house in piccadillyand had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxesmainheavy oneswith a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose iasked him if he could tell me the number of the house in piccadilly towhich he repliedwell guvnor i forgits the number but it was only a few doors from abig white church or somethink of the kind not long built it was adusty old ouse

wanted more but e took one of themby the shoulder and was like to throw im down the steps till the lotof them went away cussin i thought that with this description i couldfind the house so having paid my friend for his information i startedoff for piccadilly i had gained a new painful experience the countcould it was evident handle the earthboxes himself if so time wasprecious for now that he had achieved a certain amount ofdistribution he could by choosing his own time complete the taskunobserved at piccadilly circus i discharged my cab and walkedwestward beyond the junior constitutional i came across the housedescribed and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairsarranged by dracula the house looked as though it had been longuntenanted the windows were encrusted with dust and the shutters wereup all the framework was black with time and from the iron the painthad mostly scaled away it was evident that up to lately there had beena large noticeboard in front of the balcony it had however beenroughly torn away the uprights which had supported it still remainingbehind the rails of the balcony i saw there were some loose boardswhose raw edges looked white i would have given a good deal to havebeen able to see the noticeboard intact as it would perhaps havegiven some clue to the ownership of the house i remembered myexperience of the investigation and purchase of carfax and i could notbut feel that if i could find the former owner there might be some meansdiscovered of gaining access to the housethere was at present nothing to be learned from the piccadilly side andnothing could be done so i went round to the back to see if anythingcould be gathered from this quarter the mews were active thepiccadilly houses being mostly in occupation i asked one or two of thegrooms and helpers whom i saw around if they could tell me anythingabout the empty house one of them said that he heard it had lately beentaken but he couldnt say from whom he told me however that up tovery lately there had been a noticeboard of for sale up and thatperhaps mitchell sons  candy the house agents could tell mesomething as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm onthe board i did not wish to seem too eager or to let my informant knowor guess too much so thanking him in the usual manner i strolledaway it was now growing dusk and the autumn night was closing in so idid not lose any time having learned the address of mitchell sons candy from a directory at the berkeley i was soon at their office insackville streetthe gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner butuncommunicative in equal proportion having once told me that thepiccadilly housewhich throughout our interview he called amansionwas sold he considered my business as concluded when iasked who had purchased it he opened his eyes a thought wider andpaused a few seconds before replyingit is sold sirpardon me i said with equal politeness but i have a special reasonfor wishing to know who purchased itagain he paused longer and raised his eyebrows still more it is soldsir was again his laconic replysurely i said you do not mind letting me know so muchbut i do mind he answered the affairs of their clients areabsolutely safe in the hands of mitchell sons  candy this wasmanifestly a prig of the first water and there was no use arguing withhim i thought i had best meet him on his own ground so i saidyour clients sir are happy in having so resolute a guardian of theirconfidence i am myself a professional man here i handed him my cardin this instance i am not prompted by curiosity i act on the part oflord godalming who wishes to know something of the property which washe understood lately for sale these words put a different complexionon affairs he saidi would like to oblige you if i could mr harker and especially wouldi like to oblige his lordship we once carried out a small matter ofrenting some chambers for him when he was the honourable arthurholmwood if you will let me have his lordships address i will consultthe house on the subject and will in any case communicate with hislordship by tonights post it will be a pleasure if we can so fardeviate from our rules as to give the required information to hislordshipi wanted to secure a friend and not to make an enemy so i thanked himgave the address at dr sewards and came away it was now dark and iwas tired and hungry i got a cup of tea at the aërated bread companyand came down to purfleet by the next traini found all the others at home mina was looking tired and pale but shemade a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful it wrung my heart tothink that i had had to keep anything from her and so caused herinquietude
