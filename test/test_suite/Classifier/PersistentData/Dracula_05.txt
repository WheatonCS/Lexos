speak in the hours that had passedthe fits of sleep or the comatose condition that passed for it hadgrown more frequent so that the pauses when conversation was possiblewere shortened arthurs presence

ietc etc to john seward m d septembermy dear sirin accordance with your wishes i enclose report of the conditions ofeverything left in my charge with regard to patient renfield thereis more to say he has had another outbreak which might have had adreadful ending but which as it fortunately happened was unattendedwith any unhappy results this afternoon a carriers cart with two menmade a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on oursthe house towhich you will remember the patient twice ran away the men stopped atour gate to ask the porter their way as they were strangers i wasmyself looking out of the study window having a smoke after dinner andsaw one of them come up to the house as he passed the window ofrenfields room the patient began to rate him from within and calledhim all the foul names he could lay his tongue to the man who seemed adecent fellow enough contented himself by telling him to shut up for afoulmouthed beggar whereon our man accused him of robbing him andwanting to murder him and said that he would hinder him if he were toswing for it i opened the window and signed to the man not to noticeso he contented himself after looking the place over and making up hismind as to what kind of a place he had got to by saying lor blessyer sir i wouldnt mind what was said to me in a bloomin madhouse ipity ye and the guvnor for havin to live in the house with a wildbeast like that then he asked his way civilly enough and i told himwhere the gate of the empty house was he went away followed by threatsand curses and revilings from our man i went down to see if i couldmake out any cause for his anger since he is usually such awellbehaved man and except his violent fits nothing of the kind hadever occurred i found him to my astonishment quite composed and mostgenial in his manner i tried to get him to talk of the incident but heblandly asked me questions as to what i meant and led me to believethat he was completely oblivious of the affair it was i am sorry tosay however only another instance of his cunning for within half anhour i heard of him again this time he had broken out through thewindow of his room and was running down the avenue i called to theattendants to follow me and ran after him for i feared he was intenton some mischief my fear was justified when i saw the same cart whichhad passed before coming down the road having on it some great woodenboxes the men were wiping their foreheads and were flushed in theface as if with violent exercise before i could get up to him thepatient rushed at them and pulling one of them off the cart began toknock his head against the ground if i had not seized him just at themoment i believe he would have killed the man there and then the otherfellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the buttend of hisheavy whip it was a terrible blow but he did not seem to mind it butseized him also and struggled with the three of us pulling us to andfro as if we were kittens you know i am no light weight and the otherswere both burly men at first he was silent in his fighting but as webegan to master him and the attendants were putting a straitwaistcoaton him he began to shout ill frustrate them they shant rob methey shant murder me by inches ill fight for my lord and master andall sorts of similar incoherent ravings it was with very considerabledifficulty that they got him back to the house and put him in the paddedroom one of the attendants hardy had a finger broken however i setit all right and he is going on wellthe two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions fordamages and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us theirthreats were however mingled with some sort of indirect apology forthe defeat of the two of them by a feeble madman they said that if ithad not been for the way their strength had been spent in carrying andraising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work ofhim they gave as another reason for their defeat the extraordinarystate of drouth to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature oftheir occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of theirlabours of any place of public entertainment i quite understood theirdrift and after a stiff glass of grog or rather more of the same andwith each a sovereign in hand they made light of the attack and sworethat they would encounter a worse madman any day for the pleasure ofmeeting so bloomin good a bloke as your correspondent i took theirnames and addresses in case they might be needed they are asfollowsjack smollet of duddings

lucysuch a sad blow has befallen us mr hawkins has died very suddenlysome may not think it so sad for us but we had both come to so love himthat it really seems as though we had lost a father i never knew eitherfather or mother so that the dear old mans death is a real blow to mejonathan is greatly distressed it is not only that he feels sorrowdeep sorrow for the dear good man who has befriended him all his lifeand now at the end has treated him like his own son and left him afortune which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond thedream of avarice but jonathan feels it on another account he says theamount of responsibility which it puts upon him makes him nervous hebegins to doubt himself i try to cheer him up and my belief in himhelps him to have a belief in himself but it is here that the graveshock that he experienced tells upon him the most oh it is too hardthat a sweet simple noble strong nature such as hisa nature whichenabled him by our dear good friends aid to rise from clerk to masterin a few yearsshould be so injured that the very essence of itsstrength is gone forgive me dear if i worry you with my troubles inthe midst of your own happiness but lucy dear i must tell some onefor the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance to jonathantries me and i have no one here that i can confide in i dread comingup to london as we must do the day after tomorrow for poor mrhawkins left in his will that he was to be buried in the grave with hisfather as there are no relations at all jonathan will have to be chiefmourner i shall try to run over to see you dearest if only for a fewminutes forgive me for troubling you with all blessingsyour lovingmina harkerdr sewards diary septemberonly resolution and habit can let me make an entrytonight i am too miserable too lowspirited too sick of the worldand all in it including life itself that i would not care if i heardthis moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death and he hasbeen flapping those grim wings to some purpose of latelucys motherand arthurs father and now let me get on with my worki duly relieved van helsing in his watch over lucy we wanted arthur togo to rest also but he refused at first it was only when i told himthat we should want him to help us during the day and that we must notall break down for want of rest lest lucy should suffer that he agreedto go van helsing was very kind to him come my child he saidcome with me you are sick and weak and have had much sorrow and muchmental pain as well as that tax on your strength that we know of youmust not be alone for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarmscome to the drawingroom where there is a big fire and there are twosofas you shall lie on one and i on the other and our sympathy willbe comfort to each other even though we do not speak and even if wesleep arthur went off with him casting back a longing look on lucysface which lay in her pillow almost whiter than the lawn she layquite still and i looked round the room to see that all was as itshould be i could see that the professor had carried out in this roomas in the other his purpose of using the garlic the whole of thewindowsashes reeked with it and round lucys neck over the silkhandkerchief which van helsing made her keep on was a rough chaplet ofthe same odorous flowers lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously andher face was at its worst for the open mouth showed the pale gums herteeth in the dim uncertain light seemed longer and sharper than theyhad been in the morning in particular by some trick of the light thecanine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest i sat down by herand presently she moved uneasily at the same moment there came a sortof dull flapping or buffeting at the window i went over to it softlyand peeped out by the corner of the blind there was a full moonlightand i could see that the noise was made by a great bat which wheeledrounddoubtless attracted by the light although so dimand every nowand again struck the window with its wings when i came back to my seati found that lucy had moved slightly and had torn away the garlicflowers from her throat i replaced them as well as i could and satwatching herpresently she woke and i gave her food as van helsing had prescribedshe took but a little and that languidly there did not seem to be withher now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hithertoso marked her illness it struck me as curious that the moment shebecame conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her it wascertainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state with thestertorous breathing she put the flowers from her but that when shewaked she clutched them close there was no possibility of making anymistake about this for in the long hours that followed she had manyspells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many timesat six oclock van helsing came to relieve me arthur had then falleninto a doze and he mercifully let him sleep on when he saw lucys facei could hear the sissing indraw of his breath and he said to me in asharp whisper draw up the blind i want light then he bent downand with his face almost touching lucys examined her carefully heremoved the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat ashe did so he started back and i could hear his ejaculation meingott as it was smothered in his throat i bent over and looked tooand as i noticed some queer chill came over methe wounds on the throat had absolutely disappearedfor fully five minutes van helsing stood looking at her with his faceat its sternest then he turned to me and said calmlyshe is dying it will not be long now it will be much difference markme whether she dies conscious or in her sleep wake that poor boy andlet him come and see the last he trusts us and we have promised himi went to the diningroom and waked him he was dazed for a moment butwhen he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shuttershe thought he was late and expressed his fear i assured him that lucywas still asleep but told him as gently as i could that both vanhelsing and i feared that the end was near he covered his face with hishands and slid down on his knees by the sofa where he remainedperhaps a minute with his head buried praying whilst his shouldersshook with grief i took him by the hand and raised him up come isaid my dear old fellow summon all your fortitude it will be bestand easiest for herwhen we came into lucys room i could see that van helsing had withhis usual forethought been putting matters straight and makingeverything look as pleasing as possible he had even brushed lucyshair so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples when wecame into the room she opened her eyes and seeing him whisperedsoftlyarthur oh my love i am so glad you have come he was stooping tokiss her when van helsing motioned him back no he whispered notyet hold her hand it will comfort her moreso arthur took her hand and knelt beside her and she looked her bestwith all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes thengradually her eyes closed and she sank to sleep for a little bit herbreast heaved softly and her breath came and went like a tired childsand then insensibly there came the strange change which i had noticed inthe night her breathing grew stertorous the mouth opened and the palegums drawn back made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever in asort of sleepwaking vague unconscious way she opened her eyes whichwere now dull and hard at once and said in a soft voluptuous voicesuch as i had never heard from her lipsarthur oh my love i am so glad you have come kiss me arthur benteagerly over to kiss her but at that instant van helsing who like mehad been startled by her voice swooped upon him and catching him bythe neck with both hands dragged him back with a fury of strength whichi never thought he could have possessed and actually hurled him almostacross the roomnot for your life he said not for your living soul and hers andhe stood between them like a lion at bayarthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to door say and before any impulse of violence could seize him he realisedthe place and the occasion and stood silent waitingi kept my eyes fixed on lucy as did van helsing and we saw a spasm asof rage flit like a shadow over her face the sharp teeth champedtogether then her eyes closed and she breathed heavilyvery shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness andputting out her poor pale thin hand took van helsings great brownone drawing it to her she kissed it my true friend she said in afaint voice but with untellable pathos my true friend and his ohguard him and give me peacei swear it he said solemnly kneeling beside her and holding up hishand as one who registers an oath then he turned to arthur and saidto him come my child take her hand in yours and kiss her on theforehead and only oncetheir eyes met instead of their lips and so they partedlucys eyes closed and van helsing who had been watching closely tookarthurs arm and drew him awayand then lucys breathing became stertorous again and all at once itceasedit is all over said van helsing she is deadi took arthur by the arm and led him away to the drawingroom where hesat down and covered his face with his hands sobbing in a way thatnearly broke me down to seei went back to the room and found van helsing looking at poor lucy andhis face was sterner than ever some change had come over her bodydeath had given back part of her beauty for her brow and cheeks hadrecovered some of their flowing lines even the lips had lost theirdeadly pallor it was as if the blood no longer needed for the workingof the heart had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude asmight be    we thought her dying whilst she slept        and sleeping when she diedi stood beside van helsing and saidah well poor girl there is peace for her at last it is the endhe turned to me and said with grave solemnitynot so alas not so it is only the beginningwhen i asked him what he meant he only shook his head and answeredwe can do nothing as yet wait and seethe funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day so that lucy andher mother might be buried together i attended to all the ghastlyformalities and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff wereafflictedor blessedwith something of his own obsequious suavityeven the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked tome in a confidential brotherprofessional way when she had come outfrom the deathchambershe makes a very beautiful corpse sir its quite a privilege toattend on her its not too much to say that she will do credit to ourestablishmenti noticed that van helsing never kept far away this was possible fromthe disordered state of things in the household there were no relativesat hand and as arthur had to be back the next day to attend at hisfathers funeral we were unable to notify any one who should have beenbidden under the circumstances van helsing and i took it uponourselves to examine papers etc he insisted upon looking over lucyspapers himself i asked him why for i feared that he being aforeigner might not be quite aware of english legal requirements andso might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble he answered mei know i know you forget that i am a lawyer as well as a doctor butthis is not altogether for the law you knew that when you avoided thecoroner i have more than him to avoid there may be papers moresuchas thisas he spoke he took from his pocketbook the memorandum which had beenin lucys breast and which she had torn in her sleepwhen you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late mrswestenra seal all her papers and write him tonight for me i watchhere in the room and in miss lucys old room all night and i myselfsearch for what may be it is not well that her very thoughts go intothe hands of strangersi went on with my part of the work and in another half hour had foundthe name and address of mrs westenras solicitor and had written tohim all the poor ladys papers were in order explicit directionsregarding the place of burial were given i had hardly sealed theletter when to my surprise van helsing walked into the roomsayingcan i help you friend john i am free and if i may my service is toyouhave you got what you looked for i asked to which he repliedi did not look for any specific thing i only hoped to find and find ihave all that there wasonly some letters and a few memoranda

in hand he said to meand now friend john i think we may to bed we want sleep both youand i and rest to recuperate tomorrow we shall have much to do butfor the tonight there is no need of us alasbefore turning in we went to look at poor lucy the undertaker hadcertainly done his work well for the room was turned into a smallchapelle ardente there was a wilderness of beautiful white flowersand death was made as little repulsive as might be the end of thewindingsheet was laid over the face when the professor bent over andturned it gently back we both started at the beauty before us the tallwax candles showing a sufficient light to note it well all lucysloveliness had come back to her in death and the hours that had passedinstead of leaving traces of decays effacing fingers had butrestored the beauty of life till positively i could not believe my eyesthat i was looking at a corpsethe professor looked sternly grave he had not loved her as i had andthere was no need for tears in his eyes he said to me remain till ireturn and left the room he came back with a handful of wild garlicfrom the box waiting in the hall but which had not been opened andplaced the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed then hetook from his neck inside his collar a little gold crucifix andplaced it over the mouth he restored the sheet to its place and wecame awayi was undressing in my own room when with a premonitory tap at thedoor he entered and at once began to speaktomorrow i want you to bring me before night a set of postmortemknivesmust we make an autopsy i askedyes and no i want to operate

and went on solemnly friend john there are strange andterrible days before us let us not be two but one that so we work toa good end will you not have faith in mei took his hand and promised him i held my door open as he went awayand watched him go into his room and close the door as i stood withoutmoving i saw one of the maids pass silently along the passageshe hadher back towards me so did not see meand go into the room where lucylay the sight touched me devotion is so rare and we are so gratefulto those who show it unasked to those we love here was a poor girlputting aside the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watchalone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved so that the poor claymight not be lonely till laid to eternal rest                                   i must have slept long and soundly for it was broad daylight when vanhelsing waked me by coming into my room he came over to my bedside andsaidyou need not trouble about the knives we shall not do itwhy not i asked for his solemnity of the night before had greatlyimpressed mebecause he said sternly it is too lateor too early see here heheld up the little golden crucifix this was stolen in the nighthow stolen i asked in wonder since you have it nowbecause i get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it from thewoman who robbed the dead and the living her punishment will surelycome but not through me she knew not altogether what she did and thusunknowing she only stole now we must waithe went away on the word leaving me with a new mystery to think of anew puzzle to grapple withthe forenoon was a dreary time but at noon the solicitor came mrmarquand of wholeman sons marquand  lidderdale he was very genialand very appreciative of what we had done and took off our hands allcares as to details during lunch he told us that mrs westenra had forsome time expected sudden death from her heart and had put her affairsin absolute order he informed us that with the exception of a certainentailed property of lucys fathers which now in default of directissue went back to a distant branch of the family the whole estatereal and personal was left absolutely to arthur holmwood when he hadtold us so much he went onfrankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition andpointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter eitherpenniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a matrimonialalliance indeed we pressed the matter so far that we almost came intocollision for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry outher wishes of course we had then no alternative but to accept we wereright in principle and ninetynine times out of a hundred we shouldhave proved by the logic of events the accuracy of our judgmentfrankly however i must admit that in this case any other form ofdisposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of herwishes for by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have comeinto possession of the property and even had she only survived hermother by five minutes her property would in case there were nowilland a will was a practical impossibility in such a casehave beentreated at her decease as under intestacy in which case lord godalmingthough so dear a friend would have had no claim in the world and theinheritors being remote would not be likely to abandon their justrights for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger i assureyou my dear sirs i am rejoiced at the result perfectly rejoicedhe was a good fellow but his rejoicing at the one little partin whichhe was officially interestedof so great a tragedy was anobjectlesson in the limitations of sympathetic understandinghe did not remain long but said he would look in later in the day andsee lord godalming his coming however had been a certain comfort tous since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostilecriticism as to any of our acts arthur was expected at five oclock soa little before that time we visited the deathchamber it was so invery truth for now both mother and daughter lay in it the undertakertrue to his craft had made the best display he could of his goods andthere was a mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits atonce van helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered toexplaining that as lord godalming was coming very soon it would beless harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his fiancéequite alone the undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity andexerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left themthe night before so that when arthur came such shocks to his feelingsas we could avoid were savedpoor fellow he looked desperately sad and broken even his stalwartmanhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of hismuchtried emotions he had i knew been very genuinely and devotedlyattached to his father and to lose him and at such a time was abitter blow to him with me he was warm as ever and to van helsing hewas sweetly courteous but i could not help seeing that there was someconstraint with him the professor noticed it too and motioned me tobring him upstairs i did so and left him at the door of the room as ifelt he would like to be quite alone with her but he took my arm andled me in saying huskilyyou loved her too old fellow she told me all about it and there wasno friend had a closer place in her heart than you i dont know how tothank you for all you have done for her i cant think yethere he suddenly broke down and threw his arms round my shoulders andlaid his head on my breast cryingoh jack jack what shall i do the whole of life seems gone from meall at once and there is nothing in the wide world for me to live fori comforted him as well as i could in such cases men do not need muchexpression a grip of the hand the tightening of an arm over theshoulder a sob in unison are expressions of sympathy dear to a mansheart i stood still and silent till his sobs died away and then i saidsoftly to himcome and look at hertogether we moved over to the bed and i lifted the lawn from her facegod how beautiful she was every hour seemed to be enhancing herloveliness it frightened and amazed me somewhat and as for arthur hefell atrembling and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague atlast after a long pause he said to me in a faint whisperjack is she really deadi assured him sadly that it was so and went on to suggestfor i feltthat such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer thani could helpthat it often happened that after death faces becamesoftened and even resolved into their youthful beauty that this wasespecially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolongedsuffering it seemed to quite do away with any doubt and afterkneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at her lovingly andlong he turned aside i told him that that must be goodbye as thecoffin had to be prepared so he went back and took her dead hand in hisand kissed it and bent over and kissed her forehead he came awayfondly looking back over his shoulder at her as he camei left him in the drawingroom and told van helsing that he had saidgoodbye so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertakers mento proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin when hecame out of the room again i told him of arthurs question and herepliedi am not surprised just now i doubted for a moment myselfwe all dined together and i could see that poor art was trying to makethe best of things van helsing had been silent all dinnertime butwhen we had lit our cigars he saidlord but arthur interrupted himno no not that for gods sake not yet at any rate forgive me siri did not mean to speak offensively it is only because my loss is sorecentthe professor answered very sweetlyi only used that name because i was in doubt i must not call youmr and i have grown to love youyes my dear boy to love youasarthurarthur held out his hand and took the old mans warmlycall me what you will he said i hope i may always have the title ofa friend and let me say that i am at a loss for words to thank you foryour goodness to my poor dear he paused a moment and went on i knowthat she understood your goodness even better than i do and if i wasrude or in any way wanting at that time you acted soyou remembertheprofessor noddedyou must forgive mehe answered with a grave kindnessi know it was hard for you to quite trust me then for to trust suchviolence needs to understand and i take it that you do notthat youcannottrust me now for you do not yet understand and there may bemore times when i shall want you to trust when you cannotand maynotand must not yet understand but the time will come when your trustshall be whole and complete in me and when you shall understand asthough the sunlight himself shone through then you shall bless me fromfirst to last for your own sake and for the sake of others and for herdear sake to whom i swore to protectand indeed indeed sir said arthur warmly i shall in all waystrust you i know and believe you have a very noble heart and you arejacks friend and you were hers you shall do what you likethe professor cleared his throat a couple of times as though about tospeak and finally saidmay i ask you something nowcertainlyyou know that mrs westenra left you all her propertyno poor dear i never thought of itand as it is all yours you have a right to deal with it as you will iwant you to give me permission to read all miss lucys papers andletters believe me it is no idle curiosity i have a motive of whichbe sure she would have approved i have them all here i took thembefore we knew that all was yours so that no strange hand might touchthemno strange eye look through words into her soul i shall keepthem if i may even you may not see them yet but i shall keep themsafe no word shall be lost and in the good time i shall give them backto you its a hard thing i ask but you will do it will you not forlucys sakearthur spoke out heartily like his old selfdr van helsing you may do what you will i feel that in saying this iam doing what my dear one would have approved i shall not trouble youwith questions till the time comesthe old professor stood up as he said solemnlyand you are right there will be pain for us all but it will not beall pain nor will this pain be the last we and you tooyou most ofall my dear boywill have to pass through the bitter water before wereach the sweet but we must be brave of heart and unselfish and do ourduty and all will be welli slept on a sofa in arthurs room that night van helsing did not go tobed at all he went to and fro as if patrolling the house and wasnever out of sight of the room where lucy lay in her coffin strewn withthe wild garlic flowers which sent through the odour of lily and rosea heavy overpowering smell into the nightmina harkers journal septemberin the train to exeter jonathan sleepingit seems only yesterday that the last entry was made and yet how muchbetween then in whitby and all the world before me jonathan away andno news of him and now married to jonathan jonathan a solicitor apartner rich master of his business mr hawkins dead and buried andjonathan with another attack that may harm him some day he may ask meabout it down it all goes i am rusty in my shorthandsee whatunexpected prosperity does for usso it may be as well to freshen it upagain with an exercise anyhowthe service was very simple and very solemn there were only ourselvesand the servants there one or two old friends of his from exeter hislondon agent and a gentleman representing sir john paxton thepresident of the incorporated law society jonathan and i stood hand inhand and we felt that our best and dearest friend was gone from uswe came back to town quietly taking a bus to hyde park cornerjonathan thought it would interest me to go into the row for a while sowe sat down but there were very few people there and it wassadlooking and desolate to see so many empty chairs it made us thinkof the empty chair at home so we got up and walked down piccadillyjonathan was holding me by the arm the way he used to in old daysbefore i went to school i felt it very improper for you cant go onfor some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without thepedantry of it biting into yourself a bit but it was jonathan and hewas my husband and we didnt know anybody who saw usand we didntcare if they didso on we walked i was looking at a very beautifulgirl in a big cartwheel hat sitting in a victoria outside guilianoswhen i felt jonathan clutch my arm so tight that he hurt me and he saidunder his breath my god i am always anxious about jonathan for ifear that some nervous fit may upset him again so i turned to himquickly and asked him what it was that disturbed himhe was very pale and his eyes seemed bulging out as half in terror andhalf in amazement he gazed at a tall thin man with a beaky nose andblack moustache and pointed beard who was also observing the prettygirl he was looking at her so hard that he did not see either of usand so i had a good view of him his face was not a good face it washard and cruel and sensual and his big white teeth that looked allthe whiter because his lips were so red were pointed like an animalsjonathan kept staring at him till i was afraid he would notice ifeared he might take it ill he looked so fierce and nasty i askedjonathan why he was disturbed and he answered evidently thinking thati knew as much about it as he did do you see who it isno dear i said i dont know him who is it his answer seemed toshock and thrill me for it was said as if he did not know that it wasto me mina to whom he was speakingit is the man himselfthe poor dear was evidently terrified at somethingvery greatlyterrified i do believe that if he had not had me to lean on and tosupport him he would have sunk down he kept staring a man came out ofthe shop with a small parcel and gave it to the lady who then droveoff the dark man kept his eyes fixed on her and when the carriagemoved up piccadilly he followed in the same direction and hailed ahansom jonathan kept looking after him and said as if to himselfi believe it is the count but he has grown young my god if this beso oh my god my god if i only knew if i only knew he wasdistressing himself so much that i feared to keep his mind on thesubject by asking him any questions so i remained silent i drew himaway quietly and he holding my arm came easily we walked a littlefurther and then went in and sat for a while in the green park it wasa hot day for autumn and there was a comfortable seat in a shady placeafter a few minutes staring at nothing jonathans eyes closed and hewent quietly into a sleep with his head on my shoulder i thought itwas the best thing for him so did not disturb him in about twentyminutes he woke up and said to me quite cheerfullywhy mina have i been asleep oh do forgive me for being so rudecome and well have a cup of tea somewhere he had evidently forgottenall about the dark stranger as in his illness he had forgotten all thatthis episode had reminded him of i dont like this lapsing intoforgetfulness it may make or continue some injury to the brain i mustnot ask him for fear i shall do more harm than good but i must somehowlearn the facts of his journey abroad the time is come i fear when imust open that parcel and know what is written oh jonathan you willi know forgive me if i do wrong but it is for your own dear sake                                   latera sad homecoming in every waythe house empty of the dearsoul who was so good to us jonathan still pale and dizzy under a slightrelapse of his malady and now a telegram from van helsing whoever hemay beyou will be grieved to hear that mrs westenra died five days ago andthat lucy died the day before yesterday they were both buried todayoh what a wealth of sorrow in a few words poor mrs westenra poorlucy gone gone never to return to us and poor poor arthur to havelost such sweetness out of his life god help us all to bear ourtroublesdr sewards diary septemberit is all over arthur has gone back to ring and hastaken quincey morris with him what a fine fellow is quincey i believein my heart of hearts that he suffered as much about lucys death as anyof us but he bore himself through it like a moral viking if americacan go on breeding men like that she will be a power in the worldindeed van helsing is lying down having a rest preparatory to hisjourney he goes over to amsterdam tonight but says he returnstomorrow night that he only wants to make some arrangements which canonly be made personally he is to stop with me then if he can he sayshe has work to do in london which may take him some time poor oldfellow i fear that the strain of the past week has broken down even hisiron strength all the time of the burial he was i could see puttingsome terrible restraint on himself when it was all over we werestanding beside arthur who poor fellow was speaking of his part inthe operation where his blood had been transfused to his lucys veins icould see van helsings face grow white and purple by turns arthur wassaying that he felt since then as if they two had been really marriedand that she was his wife in the sight of god none of us said a word ofthe other operations and none of us ever shall arthur and quincey wentaway together to the station and van helsing and i came on here themoment we were alone in the carriage he gave way to a regular fit ofhysterics he has denied to me since that it was hysterics and insistedthat it was only his sense of humour asserting itself under veryterrible conditions he laughed till he cried and i had to draw downthe blinds lest any one should see us and misjudge and then he criedtill he laughed again and laughed and cried together just as a womandoes i tried to be stern with him as one is to a woman under thecircumstances but it had no effect men and women are so different inmanifestations of nervous strength or weakness then when his face grewgrave and stern again i asked him why his mirth and why at such a timehis reply was in a way characteristic of him for it was logical andforceful and mysterious he saidah you dont comprehend friend john do not think that i am not sadthough i laugh see i have cried even when the laugh did choke me butno more think that i am all sorry when i cry for the laugh he comejust the same keep it always with you that laughter who knock at yourdoor and say may i come in is not the true laughter no he is aking and he come when and how he like he ask no person he choose notime of suitability he say i am here behold in example i grieve myheart out for that so sweet young girl i give my blood for her thoughi am old and worn i give my time my skill my sleep i let my othersufferers want that so she may have all and yet i can laugh at her verygravelaugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon hercoffin and say thud thud to my heart till it send back the bloodfrom my cheek my heart bleed for that poor boythat dear boy so ofthe age of mine own boy had i been so blessed that he live and with hishair and eyes the same there you know now why i love him so and yetwhen he say things that touch my husbandheart to the quick and make myfatherheart yearn to him as to no other mannot even to you friendjohn for we are more level in experiences than father and sonyet evenat such moment king laugh he come to me and shout and bellow in my earhere i am here i am till the blood come dance back and bring some ofthe sunshine that he carry with him to my cheek oh friend john it isa strange world a sad world a world full of miseries and woes andtroubles and yet when king laugh come he make them all dance to thetune he play bleeding hearts and dry bones of the churchyard andtears that burn as they fallall dance together to the music that hemake with that smileless mouth of him and believe me friend john thathe is good to come and kind ah we men and women are like ropes drawntight with strain that pull us different ways then tears come andlike the rain on the ropes they brace us up until perhaps the strainbecome too great and we break but king laugh he come like thesunshine and he ease off the strain again and we bear to go on withour labour what it may bei did not like to wound him by pretending not to see his idea but as idid not yet understand the cause of his laughter i asked him as heanswered me his face grew stern and he said in quite a differenttoneoh it was the grim irony of it allthis so lovely lady garlanded withflowers that looked so fair as life till one by one we wondered if shewere truly dead she laid in that so fine marble house in that lonelychurchyard where rest so many of her kin laid there with the motherwho loved her and whom she loved and that sacred bell going tolltoll toll so sad and slow and those holy men with the whitegarments of the angel pretending to read books and yet all the timetheir eyes never on the page and all of us with the bowed head and allfor what she is dead so is it notwell for the life of me professor i said i cant see anything tolaugh at in all that why your explanation makes it a harder puzzlethan before but even if the burial service was comic what about poorart and his trouble why his heart was simply breakingjust so said he not that the transfusion of his blood to her veins hadmade her truly his brideyes and it was a sweet and comforting idea for himquite so but there was a difficulty friend john if so that thenwhat about the others ho ho then this so sweet maid is a polyandristand me with my poor wife dead to me but alive by churchs law thoughno wits all goneeven i who am faithful husband to this nownowifeam bigamisti dont see where the joke comes in there either i said and i didnot feel particularly pleased with him for saying such things he laidhis hand on my arm and saidfriend john forgive me if i pain i showed not my feeling to otherswhen it would wound but only to you my old friend whom i can trustif you could have looked into my very heart then when i want to laughif you could have done so when the laugh arrived if you could do sonow when king laugh have pack up his crown and all that is to himforhe go far far away from me and for a long long timemaybe you wouldperhaps pity me the most of alli was touched by the tenderness of his tone and asked whybecause i knowand now we are all scattered and for many a long day loneliness willsit over our roofs with brooding wings lucy lies in the tomb of herkin a lordly deathhouse in a lonely churchyard away from teeminglondon where the air is fresh and the sun rises over hampstead hilland where wild flowers grow of their own accordso i can finish this diary and god only knows if i shall ever beginanother if i do or if i even open this again it will be to deal withdifferent people and different themes for here at the end where theromance of my life is told ere i go back to take up the thread of mylifework i say sadly and without hope                        finisthe westminster gazette  september                          a hampstead mysterythe neighbourhood of hampstead is just at present exercised with aseries of events which seem to run on lines parallel to those of whatwas known to the writers of headlines as the kensington horror orthe stabbing woman or the woman in black during the past two orthree days several cases have occurred of young children straying fromhome or neglecting to return from their playing on the heath in allthese cases the children were too young to give any properlyintelligible account of themselves but the consensus of their excusesis that they had been with a bloofer lady it has always been late inthe evening when they have been missed and on two occasions thechildren have not been found until early in the following morning it isgenerally supposed in the neighbourhood that as the first child missedgave as his reason for being away that a bloofer lady had asked him tocome for a walk the others had picked up the phrase and used it asoccasion served this is the more natural as the favourite game of thelittle ones at present is luring each other away by wiles acorrespondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending tobe the bloofer lady is supremely funny some of our caricaturistsmight he says take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing thereality and the picture it is only in accordance with generalprinciples of human nature that the bloofer lady should be the popularrôle at these al fresco performances our correspondent naïvely saysthat even ellen terry could not be so winningly attractive as some ofthese grubbyfaced little children pretendand even imaginethemselvesto bethere is however possibly a serious side to the question for some ofthe children indeed all who have been missed at night have beenslightly torn or wounded in the throat the wounds seem such as might bemade by a rat or a small dog and although of not much importanceindividually would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them hasa system or method of its own the police of the division have beeninstructed to keep a sharp lookout for straying children especiallywhen very young in and around hampstead heath and for any stray dogwhich may be about               the westminster gazette  september                            extra special                         the hampstead horror

a furze bush at theshooters hill side of hampstead heath which is perhaps lessfrequented than the other parts it has the same tiny wound in thethroat as has been noticed in other cases it was terribly weak andlooked quite emaciated it too when partially restored had the commonstory to tell of being lured away by the bloofer lady septemberjonathan is better after a bad night i am so glad thathe has plenty of work to do for that keeps his mind off the terriblethings and oh i am rejoiced that he is not now weighed down with theresponsibility of his new position i knew he would be true to himselfand now how proud i am to see my jonathan rising to the height of hisadvancement and keeping pace in all ways with the duties that come uponhim he will be away all day till late for he said he could not lunchat home my household work is done so i shall take his foreign journaland lock myself up in my room and read it septemberi hadnt the heart to write last night that terriblerecord of jonathans upset me so poor dear how he must have sufferedwhether it be true or only imagination i wonder if there is any truthin it at all did he get his brain fever and then write all thoseterrible things or had he some cause for it all i suppose i shallnever know for i dare not open the subject to him and yet that manwe saw yesterday he seemed quite certain of him poor fellow isuppose it was the funeral upset him and sent his mind back on sometrain of thought he believes it all himself i remember how on ourweddingday he said unless some solemn duty come upon me to go back tothe bitter hours asleep or awake mad or sane there seems to bethrough it all some thread of continuity that fearful count wascoming to london if it should be and he came to london with histeeming millions there may be a solemn duty and if it come we mustnot shrink from it i shall be prepared i shall get my typewriterthis very hour and begin transcribing then we shall be ready for othereyes if required and if it be wanted then perhaps if i am readypoor jonathan may not be upset for i can speak for him and never lethim be troubled or worried with it at all if ever jonathan quite getsover the nervousness he may want to tell me of it all and i can ask himquestions and find out things and see how i may comfort him septemberconfidencedear madami pray you to pardon my writing in that i am so far friend as

abouther that is the reason of his coming it is concerning lucy and hersleepwalking and not about jonathan then i shall never know the realtruth now how silly i am that awful journal gets hold of myimagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour ofcourse it is about lucy that habit came back to the poor dear and thatawful night on the cliff must have made her ill i had almost forgottenin my own affairs how ill she was afterwards she must have told himof her sleepwalking adventure on the cliff and that i knew all aboutit and now he wants me to tell him what she knows so that he mayunderstand i hope i did right in not saying anything of it to mrswestenra i should never forgive myself if any act of mine were it evena negative one brought harm on poor dear lucy i hope too dr vanhelsing will not blame me i have had so much trouble and anxiety oflate that i feel i cannot bear more just at presenti suppose a cry does us all good at timesclears the air as other raindoes perhaps it was reading the journal yesterday that upset me andthen jonathan went away this morning to stay away from me a whole dayand night the first time we have been parted since our marriage i dohope the dear fellow will take care of himself and that nothing willoccur to upset him it is two oclock and the doctor will be here soonnow i shall say nothing of jonathans journal unless he asks me i amso glad i have typewritten out my own journal so that in case he asksabout lucy i can hand it to him it will save much questioning                                   laterhe has come and gone oh what a strange meeting and how itall makes my head whirl round i feel like one in a dream can it be allpossible or even a part of it if i had not read jonathans journalfirst i should never have accepted even a possibility poor poor dearjonathan how he must have suffered please the good god all this maynot upset him again i shall try to save him from it but it may be evena consolation and a help to himterrible though it be and awful in itsconsequencesto know for certain that his eyes and ears and brain didnot deceive him and that it is all true it may be that it is the doubtwhich haunts him that when the doubt is removed no matterwhichwaking or dreamingmay prove the truth he will be moresatisfied and better able to bear the shock dr van helsing must be agood man as well as a clever one if he is arthurs friend and drsewards and if they brought him all the way from holland to look afterlucy i feel from having seen him that he is good and kind and of anoble nature when he comes tomorrow i shall ask him about jonathanand then please god all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a goodend i used to think i would like to practise interviewing jonathansfriend on the exeter news told him that memory was everything in suchworkthat you must be able to put down exactly almost every wordspoken even if you had to refine some of it afterwards here was a rareinterview i shall try to record it verbatimit was halfpast two oclock when the knock came i took my courage àdeux mains and waited in a few minutes mary opened the door andannounced dr van helsingi rose and bowed and he came towards me a man of medium weightstrongly built with his shoulders set back over a broad deep chest anda neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck the poiseof the head strikes one at once as indicative of thought and power thehead is noble wellsized broad and large behind the ears the facecleanshaven shows a hard square chin a large resolute mobilemouth a goodsized nose rather straight but with quick sensitivenostrils that seem to broaden as the big bushy brows come down and themouth tightens the forehead is broad and fine rising at first almoststraight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide apartsuch a forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble over itbut falls naturally back and to the sides big dark blue eyes are setwidely apart and are quick and tender or stern with the mans moods hesaid to memrs harker is it not i bowed assentthat was miss mina murray again i assentedit is mina murray that i came to see that was friend of that poor dearchild lucy westenra madam mina it is on account of the dead i comesir i said you could have no better claim on me than that you werea friend and helper of lucy westenra and i held out my hand he tookit and said tenderlyoh madam mina i knew that the friend of that poor lily girl must begood but i had yet to learn he finished his speech with a courtlybow i asked him what it was that he wanted to see me about so he atonce begani have read your letters to miss lucy forgive me but i had to beginto inquire somewhere and there was none to ask i know that you werewith her at whitby she sometimes kept a diaryyou need not looksurprised madam mina it was begun after you had left and was inimitation of youand in that diary she traces by inference certainthings to a sleepwalking in which she puts down that you saved her ingreat perplexity then i come to you and ask you out of your so muchkindness to tell me all of it that you can rememberi can tell you i think dr van helsing all about itah then you have good memory for facts for details it is not alwaysso with young ladiesno doctor but i wrote it all down at the time i can show it to youif you likeoh madam mina i will be grateful

doctors letter that all i wrote down wastrue it seems to have made a new man of me it was the doubt as to thereality of the whole thing that knocked me over i felt impotent and inthe dark and distrustful but now that i know i am not afraid evenof the count he has succeeded after all then in his design in gettingto london and it was he i saw he has got younger and how van helsingis the man to unmask him and hunt him out if he is anything like whatmina says we sat late and talked it all over mina is dressing and ishall call at the hotel in a few minutes and bring him overhe was i think surprised to see me when i came into the room where hewas and introduced myself he took me by the shoulder and turned myface round to the light and said after a sharp scrutinybut madam mina told me you were ill that you had had a shock it wasso funny to hear my wife called madam mina by this kindlystrongfaced old man i smiled and saidi was ill i have had a shock but you have cured me alreadyand howby your letter to mina last night i was in doubt and then everythingtook a hue of unreality and i did not know what to trust even theevidence of my own senses not knowing what to trust i did not knowwhat to do and so had only to keep on working in what had hitherto beenthe groove of my life the groove ceased to avail me and i mistrustedmyself doctor you dont know what it is to doubt everything evenyourself no you dont you couldnt with eyebrows like yours heseemed pleased and laughed as he saidso you are physiognomist i learn more here with each hour i am withso much pleasure coming to you to breakfast and oh sir you willpardon praise from an old man but you are blessed in your wife iwould listen to him go on praising mina for a day so i simply noddedand stood silentshe is

station when we were parting hesaidperhaps you will come to town if i send to you and take madam minatoowe shall both come when you will i saidi had got him the morning papers and the london papers of the previousnight and while we were talking at the carriage window waiting for thetrain to start he was turning them over his eyes suddenly seemed tocatch something in one of them the westminster gazettei knew it bythe colourand he grew quite white he read something intentlygroaning to himself mein gott mein gott so soon so soon i do notthink he remembered me at the moment just then the whistle blew andthe train moved off this recalled him to himself and he leaned out ofthe window and waved his hand calling out love to madam mina i shallwrite so soon as ever i candr sewards diary septembertruly there is no such thing as finality not a weeksince i said finis and yet here i am starting fresh again or rathergoing on with the same record until this afternoon i had no cause tothink of what is done renfield had become to all intents as sane ashe ever was he was already well ahead with his fly business and he hadjust started in the spider line also so he had not been of any troubleto me i had a letter from arthur written on sunday and from it igather that he is bearing up wonderfully well quincey morris is withhim and that is much of a help for he himself is a bubbling well ofgood spirits quincey wrote me a line too and from him i hear thatarthur is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy so as tothem all my mind is at rest as for myself i was settling down to mywork with the enthusiasm which i used to have for it so that i mightfairly have said that the wound which poor lucy left on me was becomingcicatrised everything is however now reopened and what is to be theend god only knows i have an idea that van helsing thinks he knowstoo but he will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity hewent to exeter yesterday and stayed there all night today he cameback and almost bounded into the room at about halfpast five oclockand thrust last nights westminster gazette into my handwhat do you think of that he asked as he stood back and folded hisarmsi looked over the paper for i really did not know what he meant but hetook it from me and pointed out a paragraph about children being decoyedaway at hampstead it did not convey much to me until i reached apassage where it described small punctured wounds on their throats anidea struck me and i looked up well he saidit is like poor lucysand what do you make of itsimply that there is some cause in common whatever it was that injuredher has injured them i did not quite understand his answerthat is true indirectly but not directlyhow do you mean professor i asked i was a little inclined to takehis seriousness lightlyfor after all four days of rest and freedomfrom burning harrowing anxiety does help to restore ones spiritsbutwhen i saw his face it sobered me never even in the midst of ourdespair about poor lucy had he looked more sterntell me i said i can hazard no opinion i do not know what tothink and i have no data on which to found a conjecturedo you mean to tell me friend john that you have no suspicion as towhat poor lucy died of not after all the hints given not only byevents but by meof nervous prostration following on great loss or waste of bloodand how the blood lost or waste i shook my head he stepped over andsat down beside me and went onyou are clever man friend john you reason well and your wit is boldbut you are too prejudiced you do not let your eyes see nor your earshear and that which is outside your daily life is not of account toyou do you not think that there are things which you cannot understandand yet which are that some people see

our science that it wants toexplain all and if it explain not then it says there is nothing toexplain but yet we see around us every day the growth of new beliefswhich think themselves new and which are yet but the old which pretendto be younglike the fine ladies at the opera i suppose now you do notbelieve in corporeal transference no nor in materialisation no norin astral bodies no nor in the reading of thought no nor inhypnotismyes i said charcot has proved that pretty well he smiled as hewent on then you are satisfied as to it yes and of course then youunderstand how it act and can follow the mind of the greatcharcotalas that he is no moreinto the very soul of the patientthat he influence no then friend john am i to take it that yousimply accept fact and are satisfied to let from premise to conclusionbe a blank no then tell mefor i am student of the brainhow youaccept the hypnotism and reject the thought reading let me tell you myfriend that there are things done today in electrical science whichwould have been deemed unholy by the very men who discoveredelectricitywho would themselves not so long before have been burnedas wizards there are always mysteries in life why
