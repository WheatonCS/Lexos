have led them round his two meadowsbut the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a whitefrost turned back and while sir william accompanied him charlottetook her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleasedprobably to have the opportunity of showing it without her husbandshelp it was rather small but well built and convenient and everythingwas fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of whichelizabeth gave charlotte all the credit when mr collins could beforgotten there was really an air of great comfort throughout and bycharlottes evident enjoyment of it elizabeth supposed he must be oftenforgottenshe had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country itwas spoken of again while they were at dinner when mr collins joiningin observedyes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherinede bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you willbe delighted with her she is all affability and condescension and idoubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her noticewhen service is over i have scarcely any hesitation in saying shewill include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which shehonours us during your stay here her behaviour to my dear charlotte ischarming we dine at rosings twice every week and are never allowedto walk home her ladyships carriage is regularly ordered for us ishould say one of her ladyships carriages for she has severallady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed addedcharlotte and a most attentive neighbourvery true my dear that is exactly what i say she is the sort ofwoman whom one cannot regard with too much deferencethe evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire newsand telling again what had already been written and when it closedelizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate uponcharlottes degree of contentment to understand her address in guidingand composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that itwas all done very well she had also to anticipate how her visitwould pass the quiet tenor of their usual employments the vexatiousinterruptions of mr collins and the gaieties of their intercourse withrosings a lively imagination soon settled it allabout the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting readyfor a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house inconfusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody runningup stairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her she openedthe door and met maria in the landing place who breathless withagitation cried outoh my dear eliza pray make haste and come into the diningroom forthere is such a sight to be seen i will not tell you what it is makehaste and come down this momentelizabeth asked questions in vain maria would tell her nothing moreand down they ran into the diningroom which fronted the lane inquest of this wonder it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at thegarden gateand is this all cried elizabeth i expected at least that the pigswere got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and herdaughterla my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake it is notlady catherine the old lady is mrs jenkinson who lives with themthe other is miss de bourgh only look at her she is quite a littlecreature who would have thought that she could be so thin and smallshe is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this windwhy does she not come inoh charlotte says she hardly ever does it is the greatest of favourswhen miss de bourgh comes ini like her appearance said elizabeth struck with other ideas shelooks sickly and cross yes she will do for him very well she willmake him a very proper wifemr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversationwith the ladies and sir william to elizabeths high diversion wasstationed in the doorway in earnest contemplation of the greatnessbefore him and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked thatwayat length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on andthe others returned into the house mr collins no sooner saw the twogirls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune whichcharlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was askedto dine at rosings the next daymr collinss triumph in consequence of this invitation was completethe power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wonderingvisitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and hiswife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunityof doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of ladycatherines condescension as he knew not how to admire enoughi confess said he that i should not have been at all surprised byher ladyships asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening atrosings i rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that itwould happen but who could have foreseen such an attention as this whocould have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine therean invitation moreover including the whole party so immediatelyafter your arrivali am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir williamfrom that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are whichmy situation in life has allowed me to acquire about the court suchinstances of elegant breeding are not uncommonscarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but theirvisit to rosings mr collins was carefully instructing them in whatthey were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants andso splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower themwhen the ladies were separating for the toilette he said to elizabethdo not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel ladycatherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us whichbecomes herself and her daughter i would advise you merely to put onwhatever of your clothes is superior to the restthere is no occasionfor anything more lady catherine will not think the worse of youfor being simply dressed she likes to have the distinction of rankpreservedwhile they were dressing he came two or three times to their differentdoors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very muchobjected to be kept waiting for her dinner such formidable accounts ofher ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucaswho had been little used to company and she looked forward to herintroduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had doneto his presentation at st jamessas the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half amile across the park every park has its beauty and its prospects andelizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in suchraptures as mr collins expected the scene to inspire and was butslightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of thehouse and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originallycost sir lewis de bourghwhen they ascended the steps to the hall marias alarm was everymoment increasing and even sir william did not look perfectly calmelizabeths courage did not fail her she had heard nothing of ladycatherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents ormiraculous virtue and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thoughtshe could witness without trepidationfrom the entrancehall of which mr collins pointed out with arapturous air the fine proportion and the finished ornaments theyfollowed the servants through an antechamber to the room where ladycatherine her daughter and mrs jenkinson were sitting her ladyshipwith great condescension arose to receive them and as mrs collins hadsettled it with her husband that the office of introduction shouldbe hers it was performed in a proper manner without any of thoseapologies and thanks which he would have thought necessaryin spite of having been at st jamess sir william was so completelyawed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courageenough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a wordand his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edgeof her chair not knowing which way to look elizabeth found herselfquite equal to the scene and could observe the three ladies before hercomposedly lady catherine was a tall large woman with stronglymarkedfeatures which might once have been handsome her air was notconciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make hervisitors forget their inferior rank she was not rendered formidable bysilence but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a toneas marked her selfimportance and brought mr wickham immediately toelizabeths mind and from the observation of the day altogether shebelieved lady catherine to be exactly what he representedwhen after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportmentshe soon found some resemblance of mr darcy she turned her eyes on thedaughter she could almost have joined in marias astonishment at herbeing so thin and so small there was neither in figure nor face anylikeness between the ladies miss de bourgh was pale and sickly herfeatures though not plain were insignificant and she spoke verylittle except in a low voice to mrs jenkinson in whose appearancethere was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listeningto what she said and placing a screen in the proper direction beforeher eyesafter sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows toadmire the view mr collins attending them to point out its beautiesand lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worthlooking at in the summerthe dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants andall the articles of plate which mr collins had promised and as he hadlikewise foretold he took his seat at the bottom of the table by herladyships desire and looked as if he felt that life could furnishnothing greater he carved and ate and praised with delightedalacrity and every dish was commended first by him and then by sirwilliam who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his soninlawsaid in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bearbut lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration andgave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proveda novelty to them the party did not supply much conversation elizabethwas ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seatedbetween charlotte and miss de bourghthe former of whom was engaged inlistening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her alldinnertime mrs jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how littlemiss de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearingshe was indisposed maria thought speaking out of the question and thegentlemen did nothing but eat and admirewhen the ladies returned to the drawingroom there was little tobe done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without anyintermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on everysubject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used tohave her judgement controverted she inquired into charlottes domesticconcerns familiarly and minutely gave her a great deal of advice asto the management of them all told her how everything ought to beregulated in so small a family as hers and instructed her as to thecare of her cows and her poultry elizabeth found that nothing wasbeneath this great ladys attention which could furnish her with anoccasion of dictating to others in the intervals of her discoursewith mrs collins she addressed a variety of questions to maria andelizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knewthe least and who she observed to mrs collins was a very genteelpretty kind of girl she asked her at different times how many sistersshe had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any ofthem were likely to be married whether they were handsome where theyhad been educated what carriage her father kept and what had beenher mothers maiden name elizabeth felt all the impertinence ofher questions but answered them very composedly lady catherine thenobservedyour fathers estate is entailed on mr collins i think for yoursake turning to charlotte i am glad of it but otherwise i see nooccasion for entailing estates from the female line it was not thoughtnecessary in sir lewis de bourghs family do you play and sing missbenneta littleoh thensome time or other we shall be happy to hear you ourinstrument is a capital one probably superior toyou shall try itsome day do your sisters play and singone of them doeswhy did not you all learn you ought all to have learned the misswebbs

town every spring for the benefit of mastersmy mother would have had no objection but my father hates londonhas your governess left youwe never had any governessno governess how was that possible five daughters brought up at homewithout a governess i never heard of such a thing your mother musthave been quite a slave to your educationelizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not beenthe casethen who taught you who attended to you without a governess youmust have been neglectedcompared with some families i believe we were but such of us aswished to learn never wanted the means we were always encouraged toread and had all the masters that were necessary those who chose to beidle certainly mightaye no doubt but that is what a governess will prevent and if i hadknown your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engageone i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steadyand regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it it iswonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in thatway i am always glad to get a young person well placed out four niecesof mrs jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means andit was but the other day that i recommended another young personwho was merely accidentally mentioned to me and the family are quitedelighted with her mrs collins did i tell you of lady metcalfscalling yesterday to thank me she finds miss pope a treasure ladycatherine said she you have given me a treasure are any of youryounger sisters out miss bennetyes maam allall what all five out

in company but really maam i think it would be very hard uponyounger sisters that they should not have their share of society andamusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination tomarry early the lastborn has as good a right to the pleasures of youthas the first and to be kept back on such a motive i think it wouldnot be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mindupon my word said her ladyship you give your opinion very decidedlyfor so young a person pray what is your agewith three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling yourladyship can hardly expect me to own itlady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answerand elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had everdared to trifle with so much dignified impertinenceyou cannot be more than twenty i am sure therefore you need notconceal your agei am not oneandtwentywhen the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the cardtableswere placed lady catherine sir william and mr and mrs collins satdown to quadrille and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino thetwo girls had the honour of assisting mrs jenkinson to make up herparty their table was superlatively stupid scarcely a syllable wasuttered that did not relate to the game except when mrs jenkinsonexpressed her fears of miss de bourghs being too hot or too cold orhaving too much or too little light a great deal more passed at theother table lady catherine was generally speakingstating the mistakesof the three others or relating some anecdote of herself mr collinswas employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said thanking herfor every fish he won and apologising if he thought he won too manysir william did not say much he was storing his memory with anecdotesand noble nameswhen lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chosethe tables were broken up the carriage was offered to mrs collinsgratefully accepted and immediately ordered the party then gatheredround the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they wereto have on the morrow from these instructions they were summoned bythe arrival of the coach and with many speeches of thankfulness on mrcollinss side and as many bows on sir williams they departed as soonas they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousinto give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which forcharlottes sake she made more favourable than it really was but hercommendation though costing her some trouble could by no means satisfymr collins and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyships praiseinto his own handssir william stayed only a week at hunsford but his visit was longenough to convince him of his daughters being most comfortably settledand of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were notoften met with while sir william was with them mr collins devoted hismorning to driving him out in his gig and showing him the country butwhen he went away the whole family returned to their usual employmentsand elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of hercousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfastand dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or inreading and writing and looking out of the window in his own bookroomwhich fronted the road the room in which the ladies sat was backwardselizabeth had at first rather wondered that charlotte should not preferthe diningparlour for common use it was a better sized room and had amore pleasant aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellentreason for what she did for mr collins would undoubtedly have beenmuch less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively andshe gave charlotte credit for the arrangementfrom the drawingroom they could distinguish nothing in the lane andwere indebted to mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages wentalong and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaetonwhich he never failed coming to inform them of though it happenedalmost every day she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage andhad a few minutes conversation with charlotte but was scarcely everprevailed upon to get outvery few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings andnot many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewiseand till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livingsto be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so manyhours now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyshipand nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room duringthese visits she examined into their employments looked at their workand advised them to do it differently found fault with the arrangementof the furniture or detected the housemaid in negligence and if sheaccepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of findingout that mrs collinss joints of meat were too large for her familyelizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not incommission of the peace of the county she was a most active magistratein her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to herby mr collins and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed tobe quarrelsome discontented or too poor she sallied forth into thevillage to settle their differences silence their complaints and scoldthem into harmony and plentythe entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a weekand allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only onecardtable in the evening every such entertainment was the counterpartof the first their other engagements were few as the style of livingin the neighbourhood in general was beyond mr collinss reach thishowever was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her timecomfortably enough there were halfhours of pleasant conversation withcharlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she hadoften great enjoyment out of doors her favourite walk and where shefrequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine wasalong the open grove which edged that side of the park where there wasa nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself andwhere she felt beyond the reach of lady catherines curiosityin this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed awayeaster was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring anaddition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must beimportant elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that mr darcy wasexpected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were notmany of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer his coming wouldfurnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties andshe might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingleys designs on himwere by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidentlydestined by lady catherine who talked of his coming with the greatestsatisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration andseemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen bymiss lucas and herselfhis arrival was soon known at the parsonage for mr collins was walkingthe whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lanein order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making hisbow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the greatintelligence on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay hisrespects there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them formr darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son ofhis uncle lord  and to the great surprise of all the party whenmr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him charlotte had seenthem from her husbands room crossing the road and immediately runninginto the other told the girls what an honour they might expect addingi may thank you eliza for this piece of civility mr darcy wouldnever have come so soon to wait upon meelizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the complimentbefore their approach was announced by the doorbell and shortlyafterwards the three gentlemen entered the room colonel fitzwilliamwho led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person andaddress most truly the gentleman mr darcy looked just as he had beenused to look in hertfordshirepaid his compliments with his usualreserve to mrs collins and whatever might be his feelings toward herfriend met her with every appearance of composure elizabeth merelycurtseyed to him without saying a wordcolonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with thereadiness and ease of a wellbred man and talked very pleasantly buthis cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house andgarden to mrs collins sat for some time without speaking to anybodyat length however his civility was so far awakened as to inquire ofelizabeth after the health of her family she answered him in the usualway and after a moments pause addedmy eldest sister has been in town these three months have you neverhappened to see her thereshe was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to seewhether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed betweenthe bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as heanswered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet thesubject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards wentawaycolonel fitzwilliams manners were very much admired at the parsonageand the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasuresof their engagements at rosings it was some days however before theyreceived any invitation thitherfor while there were visitors in thehouse they could not be necessary and it was not till easterdayalmost a week after the gentlemens arrival that they were honoured bysuch an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church tocome there in the evening for the last week they had seen very littleof lady catherine or her daughter colonel fitzwilliam had called at theparsonage more than once during the time but mr darcy they had seenonly at churchthe invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joinedthe party in lady catherines drawingroom her ladyship receivedthem civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means soacceptable as when she could get nobody else and she was in factalmost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darcymuch more than to any other person in the roomcolonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them anything was awelcome relief to him at rosings and mrs collinss pretty friend hadmoreover caught his fancy very much he now seated himself by her andtalked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and stayingat home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half sowell entertained in that room before and they conversed with so muchspirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herselfas well as of mr darcy his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turnedtowards them with a look of curiosity and that her ladyship after awhile shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did notscruple to call outwhat is that you are saying fitzwilliam what is it you are talkingof what are you telling miss bennet let me hear what it iswe are speaking of music madam said he when no longer able to avoida replyof music then pray speak aloud it is of all subjects my delight imust have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of musicthere are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoymentof music than myself or a better natural taste if i had ever learnti should have been a great proficient and so would anne if her healthhad allowed her to apply i am confident that she would have performeddelightfully how does georgiana get on darcymr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sisters proficiencyi am very glad to hear such a good account of her said ladycatherine and pray tell her from me that she cannot expect to excelif she does not practice a good deali assure you madam he replied that she does not need such adviceshe practises very constantlyso much the better it cannot be done too much and when i next writeto her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account i oftentell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired withoutconstant practice i have told miss bennet several times that shewill never play really well unless she practises more and though mrscollins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often toldher to come to rosings every day and play on the pianoforte in mrsjenkinsons room she would be in nobodys way you know in that partof the housemr darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunts illbreeding and madeno answerwhen coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of havingpromised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument hedrew a chair near her lady catherine listened to half a song and thentalked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked awayfrom her and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianofortestationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performerscountenance elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the firstconvenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and saidyou mean to frighten me mr darcy by coming in all this state to hearme i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well thereis a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at thewill of others my courage always rises at every attempt to intimidatemei shall not say you are mistaken he replied because you could notreally believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i havehad the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you findgreat enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact arenot your ownelizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said tocolonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion ofme and teach you not to believe a word i say i am particularly unluckyin meeting with a person so able to expose my real character in a partof the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree ofcredit indeed mr darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention allthat you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshireand give me leave tosay very impolitic toofor it is provoking me to retaliate and suchthings may come out as will shock your relations to heari am not afraid of you said he smilinglypray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonelfitzwilliam i should like to know how he behaves among strangersyou shall hear thenbut prepare yourself for something very dreadfulthe first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must knowwas at a balland at this ball what do you think he did he dancedonly four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certainknowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of apartner mr darcy you cannot deny the facti had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assemblybeyond my own partytrue and nobody can ever be introduced in a ballroom well colonelfitzwilliam what do i play next my fingers wait your ordersperhaps said darcy i should have judged better had i sought anintroduction but i am illqualified to recommend myself to strangersshall we ask your cousin the reason of this said elizabeth stilladdressing colonel fitzwilliam shall we ask him why a man of sense andeducation and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommendhimself to strangersi can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying tohim it is because he will not give himself the troublei certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcyof conversing easily with those i have never seen before i cannotcatch their tone of conversation or appear interested in theirconcerns as i often see donemy fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument in themasterly manner which i see so many womens do they have not the sameforce or rapidity and do not produce the same expression but then ihave always supposed it to be my own faultbecause i will not take thetrouble of practising it is not that i do not believe my fingers ascapable as any other womans of superior executiondarcy smiled and said you are perfectly right you have employed yourtime much better no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you canthink anything wanting we neither of us perform to strangershere they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to knowwhat they were talking of elizabeth immediately began playing againlady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes saidto darcymiss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more andcould have the advantage of a london master she has a very good notionof fingering though her taste is not equal to annes anne would havebeen a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learnelizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to hiscousins praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could shediscern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to missde bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might havebeen just as likely to marry her had she been his relationlady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeths performance mixingwith them many instructions on execution and taste elizabeth receivedthem with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of thegentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyships carriage wasready to take them all homeelizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to janewhile mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the villagewhen she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of avisitor as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely tobe lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away herhalffinished letter that she might escape all impertinent questionswhen the door opened and to her very great surprise mr darcy andmr darcy only entered the roomhe seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for hisintrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies wereto be withinthey then sat down and when her inquiries after rosings were madeseemed in danger of sinking into total silence it was absolutelynecessary therefore to think of something and in this emergencerecollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire andfeeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hastydeparture she observedhow very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr darcyit must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see youall after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the daybefore he and his sisters were well i hope when you left londonperfectly so i thank youshe found that she was to receive no other answer and after a shortpause addedi think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of everreturning to netherfield againi have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spendvery little of his time there in the future he has many friends andis at a time of life when friends and engagements are continuallyincreasingif he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better forthe neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then wemight possibly get a settled family there but perhaps mr bingley didnot take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood asfor his own and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the sameprinciplei should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up assoon as any eligible purchase offerselizabeth made no answer she was afraid of talking longer of hisfriend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave thetrouble of finding a subject to himhe took the hint and soon began with this seems a very comfortablehouse lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mrcollins first came to hunsfordi believe she didand i am sure she could not have bestowed herkindness on a more grateful objectmr collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wifeyes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with oneof the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have madehim happy if they had my friend has an excellent understandingthoughi am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as thewisest thing she ever did she seems perfectly happy however and in aprudential light it is certainly a very good match for herit must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy adistance of her own family and friendsan easy distance do you call it it is nearly fifty milesand what is fifty miles of good road little more than half a daysjourney yes i call it a very easy distancei should never have considered the distance as one of the advantagesof the match cried elizabeth i should never have said mrs collinswas settled near her familyit is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire anything beyondthe very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear faras he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied sheunderstood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane andnetherfield and she blushed as she answeredi do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near herfamily the far and the near must be relative and depend on manyvarying circumstances where there is fortune to make the expenses oftravelling unimportant distance becomes no evil but that is not thecase here mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income but notsuch a one as will allow of frequent journeysand i am persuaded myfriend would not call herself near her family under less than halfthe present distancemr darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said you cannothave a right to such very strong local attachment you cannot havebeen always at longbournelizabeth looked surprised the gentleman experienced some change offeeling he drew back his chair took a newspaper from the table andglancing over it said in a colder voiceare you pleased with kenta short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either sidecalm and conciseand soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotteand her sister just returned from her walk the teteatete surprisedthem mr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intrudingon miss bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without sayingmuch to anybody went awaywhat can be the meaning of this said charlotte as soon as he wasgone my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would neverhave called us in this familiar waybut when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likelyeven to charlottes wishes to be the case and after variousconjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed fromthe difficulty of finding anything to do which was the more probablefrom the time of year all field sports were over within doors therewas lady catherine books and a billiardtable but gentlemen cannotalways be within doors and in the nearness of the parsonage or thepleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it thetwo cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thitheralmost every day they called at various times of the morning sometimesseparately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by theiraunt it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because hehad pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommendedhim still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction inbeing with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of herformer favourite george wickham and though in comparing them she sawthere was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliams mannersshe believed he might have the best informed mindbut why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficultto understand it could not be for society as he frequently sat thereten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speakit seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choicea sacrificeto propriety not a pleasure to himself he seldom appeared reallyanimated mrs collins knew not what to make of him colonelfitzwilliams occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he wasgenerally different which her own knowledge of him could not have toldher and as she would liked to have believed this change the effectof love and the object of that love her friend eliza she set herselfseriously to work to find it out she watched him whenever they were atrosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success hecertainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of thatlook was disputable it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she oftendoubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes itseemed nothing but absence of mindshe had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of hisbeing partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and mrscollins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger ofraising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in heropinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friends dislike wouldvanish if she could suppose him to be in her powerin her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marryingcolonel fitzwilliam he was beyond comparison the most pleasant man hecertainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible butto counterbalance these advantages mr darcy had considerable patronagein the church and his cousin could have none at allmore than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the parkunexpectedly meet mr darcy she felt all the perverseness of themischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and toprevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first thatit was a favourite haunt of hers how it could occur a second timetherefore was very odd yet it did and even a third it seemed likewilful illnature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it wasnot merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then awaybut he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her henever said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talkingor of listening much but it struck her in the course of their thirdrencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questionsabouther pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and heropinion of mr and mrs collinss happiness and that in speaking ofrosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed toexpect that whenever she came into kent again she would be stayingthere too his words seemed to imply it could he have colonelfitzwilliam in his thoughts she supposed if he meant anything he mustmean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter it distressedher a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in thepales opposite the parsonageshe was engaged one day as she walked in perusing janes last letterand dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written inspirits when instead of being again surprised by mr darcy she sawon looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her putting away theletter immediately and forcing a smile she saidi did not know before that you ever walked this wayi have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generallydo every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage areyou going much fartherno i should have turned in a momentand accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonagetogetherdo you certainly leave kent on saturday said sheyesif darcy does not put it off again but i am at his disposal hearranges the business just as he pleasesand if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at leastpleasure in the great power of choice i do not know anybody who seemsmore to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darcyhe likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliambut so we all do it is only that he has better means of having itthan many others because he is rich and many others are poor i speakfeelingly a younger son you know must be inured to selfdenial anddependencein my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little ofeither now seriously what have you ever known of selfdenial anddependence when have you been prevented by want of money from goingwherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy forthese are home questionsand perhaps i cannot say that i haveexperienced many hardships of that nature but in matters of greaterweight i may suffer from want of money younger sons cannot marry wherethey likeunless where they like women of fortune which i think they very oftendoour habits of expense make us too dependent and there are not manyin my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention tomoneyis this thought elizabeth meant for me and she coloured at theidea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray whatis the usual price of an earls younger son unless the elder brother isvery sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand poundshe answered her in the same style and the subject dropped to interrupta silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passedshe soon afterwards saidi imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake ofhaving someone at his disposal i wonder he does not marry to secure alasting convenience of that kind but perhaps his sister does as wellfor the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what helikes with herno said colonel fitzwilliam that is an advantage which he mustdivide with me i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcyare you indeed and pray what sort of guardians do you make does yourcharge give you much trouble young ladies of her age are sometimes alittle difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit shemay like to have her own wayas she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the mannerin which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely togive them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or othergot pretty near the truth she directly repliedyou need not be frightened i never heard any harm of her and i daresay she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world she is avery great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance mrs hurst andmiss bingley i think i have heard you say that you know themi know them a little their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike manheis a great friend of darcysoh yes said elizabeth drily mr darcy is uncommonly kind to mrbingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of himcare of him yes i really believe darcy does take care of him inthose points where he most wants care from something that he told me inour journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted tohim but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose thatbingley was the person meant it was all conjecturewhat is it you meanit is a circumstance which darcy could not wish to be generally knownbecause if it were to get round to the ladys family it would be anunpleasant thingyou may depend upon my not mentioning itand remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to bebingley what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himselfon having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a mostimprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any otherparticulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believinghim the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and fromknowing them to have been together the whole of last summerdid mr darcy give you reasons for this interferencei understood that there were some very strong objections against theladyand what arts did he use to separate themhe did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling heonly told me what i have now told youelizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling withindignation after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why shewas so thoughtfuli am thinking of what you have been telling me said she yourcousins conduct does not suit my feelings why was he to be the judgeyou are rather disposed to call his interference officiousi do not see what right mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of hisfriends inclination or why upon his own judgement alone he was todetermine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happybut she continued recollecting herself as we know none of theparticulars it is not fair to condemn him it is not to be supposedthat there was much affection in the casethat is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is alessening of the honour of my cousins triumph very sadlythis was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a pictureof mr darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer andtherefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferentmatters until they reached the parsonage there shut into her own roomas soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruptionof all that she had heard it was not to be supposed that any otherpeople could be meant than those with whom she was connected therecould not exist in the world two men over whom mr darcy could havesuch boundless influence that he had been concerned in the measurestaken to separate bingley and jane she had never doubted but she hadalways attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangementof them if his own vanity however did not mislead him he wasthe cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane hadsuffered and still continued to suffer he had ruined for a whileevery hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart in theworld and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflictedthere were some very strong objections against the lady were colonelfitzwilliams words and those strong objections probably were herhaving one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was inbusiness in londonto jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility ofobjection all loveliness and goodness as she isher understandingexcellent her mind improved and her manners captivating neithercould anything be urged against my father who though with somepeculiarities has abilities mr darcy himself need not disdain andrespectability which he will probably never reach when she thought ofher mother her confidence gave way a little but she would not allowthat any objections there had material weight with mr darcy whosepride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want ofimportance in his friends connections than from their want of senseand she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governedby this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining mrbingley for his sisterthe agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on aheadache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added toher unwillingness to see mr darcy it determined her not to attend hercousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea mrs collinsseeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as muchas possible prevented her husband from pressing her but mr collinscould not conceal his apprehension of lady catherines being ratherdispleased by her staying at homewhen they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herselfas much as possible against mr darcy chose for her employment theexamination of all the letters which jane had written to her since herbeing in kent they contained no actual complaint nor was there anyrevival of past occurrences or any communication of present sufferingbut in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of thatcheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style and whichproceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindlydisposed towards everyone had been scarcely ever clouded elizabethnoticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with anattention which it had hardly received on the first perusal mr darcysshameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave hera keener sense of her sisters sufferings it was some consolationto think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after thenextand a still greater that in less than a fortnight she shouldherself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery ofher spirits by all that affection could doshe could not think of darcys leaving kent without remembering thathis cousin was to go with him but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clearthat he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did notmean to be unhappy about himwhile settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of thedoorbell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of itsbeing colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late inthe evening and might now come to inquire particularly after herbut this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differentlyaffected when to her utter amazement she saw mr darcy walk into theroom in an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after herhealth imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were bettershe answered him with cold civility he sat down for a few moments andthen getting up walked about the room elizabeth was surprised butsaid not a word after a silence of several minutes he came towards herin an agitated manner and thus beganin vain i have struggled it will not do my feelings will not berepressed you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and loveyouelizabeths astonishment was beyond expression she stared coloureddoubted and was silent this he considered sufficient encouragementand the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for herimmediately followed he spoke well but there were feelings besidesthose of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on thesubject of tenderness than of pride his sense of her inferiorityofits being a degradationof the family obstacles which had alwaysopposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due tothe consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend hissuitin spite of her deeplyrooted dislike she could not be insensible tothe compliment of such a mans affection and though her intentions didnot vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was toreceive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language shelost all compassion in anger she tried however to compose herself toanswer him with patience when he should have done he concluded withrepresenting to her the strength of that attachment which in spiteof all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer and withexpressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance ofhis hand as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubtof a favourable answer he spoke of apprehension and anxiety buthis countenance expressed real security such a circumstance couldonly exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into hercheeks and she saidin such cases as this it is i believe the established mode toexpress a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed howeverunequally they may be returned it is natural that obligation shouldbe felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you but icannoti have never desired your good opinion and you have certainlybestowed it most unwillingly i am sorry to have occasioned pain toanyone it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will beof short duration the feelings which you tell me have long preventedthe acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty inovercoming it after this explanationmr darcy who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixedon her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment thansurprise his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbanceof his mind was visible in every feature he was struggling for theappearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believedhimself to have attained it the pause was to elizabeths feelingsdreadful at length with a voice of forced calmness he saidand this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expectingi might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour atcivility i am thus rejected but it is of small importancei might as well inquire replied she why with so evident a desireof offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked meagainst your will against your reason and even against your characterwas not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil but i haveother provocations you know i have had not my feelings decided againstyouhad they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do youthink that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who hasbeen the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a mostbeloved sisteras she pronounced these words mr darcy changed colour but the emotionwas short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while shecontinuedi have every reason in the world to think ill of you no motive canexcuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there you dare notyou cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only meansof dividing them from each otherof exposing one to the censure of theworld for caprice and instability and the other to its derision fordisappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutestkindshe paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listeningwith an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorsehe even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulitycan you deny that you have done it she repeatedwith assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of denyingthat i did everything in my power to separate my friend from yoursister or that i rejoice in my success towards him i have beenkinder than towards myselfelizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflectionbut its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate herbut it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislikeis founded long before it had taken place my opinion of you wasdecided your character was unfolded in the recital which i receivedmany months ago from mr wickham on this subject what can you have tosay in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourselfor under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon othersyou take an eager interest in that gentlemans concerns said darcyin a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colourwho that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling aninterest in himhis misfortunes repeated darcy contemptuously yes his misfortuneshave been great indeedand of your infliction cried elizabeth with energy you have reducedhim to his present state of povertycomparative poverty you havewithheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed forhim you have deprived the best years of his life of that independencewhich was no less his due than his desert you have done all thisand yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt andridiculeand this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the roomis your opinion of me this is the estimation in which you hold mei thank you for explaining it so fully my faults according to thiscalculation are heavy indeed but perhaps added he stopping inhis walk and turning towards her these offenses might have beenoverlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of thescruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design thesebitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greaterpolicy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief ofmy being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason byreflection by everything but disguise of every sort is my abhorrencenor am i ashamed of the feelings i related they were natural andjust could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of yourconnectionsto congratulate myself on the hope of relations whosecondition in life is so decidedly beneath my ownelizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried tothe utmost to speak with composure when she saidyou are mistaken mr darcy if you suppose that the mode of yourdeclaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concernwhich i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a moregentlemanlike mannershe saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continuedyou could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way thatwould have tempted me to accept itagain his astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with anexpression of mingled incredulity and mortification she went onfrom the very beginningfrom the first moment i may almost sayofmy acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullestbelief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain ofthe feelings of others were such as to form the groundwork ofdisapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable adislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were thelast man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marryyou have said quite enough madam i perfectly comprehend yourfeelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have beenforgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my bestwishes for your health and happinessand with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard himthe next moment open the front door and quit the housethe tumult of her mind was now painfully great she knew not howto support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried forhalfanhour her astonishment as she reflected on what had passedwas increased by every review of it that she should receive an offer ofmarriage from mr darcy that he should have been in love with her forso many months so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite ofall the objections which had made him prevent his friends marryingher sister and which must appear at least with equal force in hisown casewas almost incredible it was gratifying to have inspiredunconsciously so strong an affection but his pride his abominablepridehis shameless avowal of what he had done with respect tojanehis unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he couldnot justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mrwickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soonovercame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had fora moment excited she continued in very agitated reflections till thesound of lady catherines carriage made her feel how unequal she was toencounter charlottes observation and hurried her away to her roomelizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditationswhich had at length closed her eyes she could not yet recover from thesurprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of anythingelse and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon afterbreakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise she was proceedingdirectly to her favourite walk when the recollection of mr darcyssometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the parkshe turned up the lane which led farther from the turnpikeroad thepark paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed oneof the gates into the groundafter walking two or three times along that part of the lane she wastempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates andlook into the park the five weeks which she had now passed in kent hadmade a great difference in the country and every day was adding to theverdure of the early trees she was on the point of continuing her walkwhen she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove whichedged the park he was moving that way and fearful of its being mrdarcy she was directly retreating but the person who advanced was nownear enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronouncedher name she had turned away but on hearing herself called thoughin a voice which proved it to be mr darcy she moved again towards thegate he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letterwhich she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composurei have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting youwill you do me the honour of reading that letter and then with aslight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sightwith no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosityelizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonderperceived an envelope containing two sheets of letterpaper writtenquite through in a very close hand the envelope itself was likewisefull pursuing her way along the lane she then began it it was datedfrom rosings at eight oclock in the morning and was as followsbe not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehensionof its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of thoseoffers which were last night so disgusting to you i write without anyintention of paining you or humbling myself by dwelling on wisheswhich for the happiness of both cannot be too soon forgotten and theeffort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasionshould have been spared had not my character required it to be writtenand read you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demandyour attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but idemand it of your justicetwo offenses of a very different nature and by no means of equalmagnitude you last night laid to my charge the first mentioned wasthat regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached mr bingleyfrom your sister and the other that i had in defiance of variousclaims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediateprosperity and blasted the prospects of mr wickham wilfully andwantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledgedfavourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any otherdependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expectits exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two youngpersons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks couldbear no comparison but from the severity of that blame which was lastnight so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hopeto be in the future secured when the following account of my actionsand their motives has been read if in the explanation of them whichis due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings whichmay be offensive to yours i can only say that i am sorry the necessitymust be obeyed and further apology would be absurdi had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common withothers that bingley preferred your elder sister to any other youngwoman in the country but it was not till the evening of the danceat netherfield that i had any apprehension
