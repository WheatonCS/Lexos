and grewtill on descending he could drink the oil of all the church lamps canyou tell me why in the pampas ay and elsewhere there are bats thatcome at night and open the veins of cattle and horses and suck dry theirveins how in some islands of the western seas there are bats which hangon the trees all day and those who have seen describe as like giantnuts or pods and that when the sailors sleep on the deck because thatit is hot flit down on them and thenand then in the morning arefound dead men white as even miss lucy wasgood god professor i said starting up do you mean to tell me thatlucy was bitten by such a bat and that such a thing is here in londonin the nineteenth century he waved his hand for silence and wentoncan you tell me why the tortoise lives more long than generations ofmen why the elephant goes on and on till he have seen dynasties andwhy the parrot never die only of bite of cat or dog or other complaintcan you tell me why men believe in all ages and places that there aresome few who live on always if they be permit that there are men andwomen who cannot die we all knowbecause science has vouched for thefactthat there have been toads shut up in rocks for thousands ofyears shut in one so small hole that only hold him since the youth ofthe world can you tell me how the indian fakir can make himself to dieand have been buried and his grave sealed and corn sowed on it and thecorn reaped and be cut and sown and reaped and cut again and then mencome and take away the unbroken seal and that there lie the indianfakir not dead but that rise up and walk amongst them as before herei interrupted him i was getting bewildered he so crowded on my mindhis list of natures eccentricities and possible impossibilities that myimagination was getting fired i had a dim idea that he was teaching mesome lesson as long ago he used to do in his study at amsterdam buthe used then to tell me the thing so that i could have the object ofthought in mind all the time but now i was without this help yet iwanted to follow him so i saidprofessor let me be your pet student again tell me the thesis sothat i may apply your knowledge as you go on at present i am going inmy mind from point to point as a mad man and not a sane one follows anidea i feel like a novice lumbering through a bog in a mist jumpingfrom one tussock to another in the mere blind effort to move on withoutknowing where i am goingthat is good image he said well i shall tell you my thesis isthis i want you to believeto believe whatto believe in things that you cannot let me illustrate i heard onceof an american who so defined faith that faculty which enables us tobelieve things which we know to be untrue for one i follow that manhe meant that we shall have an open mind and not let a little bit oftruth check the rush of a big truth like a small rock does a railwaytruck we get the small truth first good we keep him and we valuehim but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth inthe universethen you want me not to let some previous conviction injure thereceptivity of my mind with regard to some strange matter do i readyour lesson arightah you are my favourite pupil still it is worth to teach you nowthat you are willing to understand you have taken the first step tounderstand you think then that those so small holes in the childrensthroats were made by the same that made the hole in miss lucyi suppose so he stood up and said solemnlythen you are wrong oh would it were so but alas no it is worsefar far worsein gods name professor van helsing what do you mean i criedhe threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair and placed hiselbows on the table covering his face with his hands as he spokethey were made by miss lucyfor a while sheer anger mastered me it was as if he had during her lifestruck lucy on the face i smote the table hard and rose up as i said tohimdr van helsing are you mad he raised his head and looked at me andsomehow the tenderness of his face calmed me at once would i were hesaid madness were easy to bear compared with truth like this oh myfriend why think you did i go so far round why take so long to tellyou so simple a thing was it because i hate you and have hated you allmy life was it because i wished to give you pain was it that i wantednow so late revenge for that time when you saved my life and from afearful death ah noforgive me said i he went onmy friend it was because i wished to be gentle in the breaking to youfor i know you have loved that so sweet lady but even yet i do notexpect you to believe it is so hard to accept at once any abstracttruth that we may doubt such to be possible when we have alwaysbelieved the no of it it is more hard still to accept so sad aconcrete truth and of such a one as miss lucy tonight i go to proveit dare you come with methis staggered me a man does not like to prove such a truth byronexcepted from the category jealousy    and prove the very truth he most abhorredhe saw my hesitation and spokethe logic is simple no madmans logic this time jumping from tussockto tussock in a misty bog if it be not true then proof will be reliefat worst it will not harm if it be true ah there is the dread yetvery dread should help my cause for in it is some need of belief comei tell you what i propose first that we go off now and see that childin the hospital dr vincent of the north hospital where the paperssay the child is is friend of mine and i think of yours since you werein class at amsterdam he will let two scientists see his case if hewill not let two friends we shall tell him nothing but only that wewish to learn and thenand then he took a key from his pocket and held it up and then wespend the night you and i in the churchyard where lucy lies this isthe key that lock the tomb i had it from the coffinman to give toarthur my heart sank within me for i felt that there was some fearfulordeal before us i could do nothing however so i plucked up whatheart i could and said that we had better hasten as the afternoon waspassingwe found the child awake it had had a sleep and taken some food andaltogether was going on well dr vincent took the bandage from itsthroat and showed us the punctures there was no mistaking thesimilarity to those which had been on lucys throat they were smallerand the edges looked fresher that was all we asked vincent to what heattributed them and he replied that it must have been a bite of someanimal perhaps a rat but for his own part he was inclined to thinkthat it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northernheights of london out of so many harmless ones he said there maybe some wild specimen from the south of a more malignant species somesailor may have brought one home and it managed to escape or even fromthe zo√∂logical gardens a young one may have got loose or one be bredthere from a vampire these things do occur you know only ten days agoa wolf got out and was i believe traced up in this direction for aweek after the children were playing nothing but red riding hood on theheath and in every alley in the place until this bloofer lady scarecame along since when it has been quite a galatime with them eventhis poor little mite when he woke up today asked the nurse if hemight go away when she asked him why he wanted to go he said he wantedto play with the bloofer ladyi hope said van helsing that when you are sending the child homeyou will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it these fanciesto stray are most dangerous and if the child were to remain out anothernight it would probably be fatal but in any case i suppose you willnot let it away for some dayscertainly not not for a week at least longer if the wound is nothealedour visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on andthe sun had dipped before we came out when van helsing saw how dark itwas he saidthere is no hurry it is more late than i thought come let us seeksomewhere that we may eat and then we shall go on our waywe dined at jack straws castle along with a little crowd ofbicyclists and others who were genially noisy about ten oclock westarted from the inn it was then very dark and the scattered lampsmade the darkness greater when we were once outside their individualradius the professor had evidently noted the road we were to go for hewent on unhesitatingly but as for me i was in quite a mixup as tolocality as we went further we met fewer and fewer people till atlast we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horsepolice going their usual suburban round at last we reached the wall ofthe churchyard which we climbed over with some little difficultyforit was very dark and the whole place seemed so strange to uswe foundthe westenra tomb the professor took the key opened the creaky doorand standing back politely but quite unconsciously motioned me toprecede him there was a delicious irony in the offer in thecourtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion mycompanion followed me quickly and cautiously drew the door to aftercarefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling and not a springone in the latter case we should have been in a bad plight then hefumbled in his bag and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candleproceeded to make a light the tomb in the daytime and when wreathedwith fresh flowers had looked grim and gruesome enough but now somedays afterwards when the flowers hung lank and dead their whitesturning to rust and their greens to browns when the spider and thebeetle had resumed their accustomed dominance when timediscolouredstone and dustencrusted mortar and rusty dank iron and tarnishedbrass and clouded silverplating gave back the feeble glimmer of acandle the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have beenimagined it conveyed irresistibly the idea that lifeanimal lifewasnot the only thing which could pass awayvan helsing went about his work systematically holding his candle sothat he could read the coffin plates and so holding it that the spermdropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal hemade assurance of lucys coffin another search in his bag and he tookout a turnscrewwhat are you going to do i askedto open the coffin you shall yet be convinced straightway he begantaking out the screws and finally lifted off the lid showing thecasing of lead beneath the sight was almost too much for me it seemedto be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to havestripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living i actually tookhold of his hand to stop him he only said you shall see and againfumbling in his bag took out a tiny fretsaw striking the turnscrewthrough the lead with a swift downward stab which made me wince hemade a small hole which was however big enough to admit the point ofthe saw i had expected a rush of gas from the weekold corpse wedoctors who have had to study our dangers have to become accustomed tosuch things and i drew back towards the door but the professor neverstopped for a moment he sawed down a couple of feet along one side ofthe lead coffin and then across and down the other side taking theedge of the loose flange he bent it back towards the foot of thecoffin and holding up the candle into the aperture motioned to me tolooki drew near and looked the coffin was emptyit was certainly a surprise to me and gave me a considerable shock butvan helsing was unmoved he was now more sure than ever of his groundand so emboldened to proceed in his task are you satisfied now friendjohn he askedi felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me asi answered himi am satisfied that lucys body is not in that coffin but that onlyproves one thingand what is that friend johnthat it is not therethat is good logic he said so far as it goes but how do youhowcan youaccount for it not being thereperhaps a bodysnatcher i suggested some of the undertakers peoplemay have stolen it i felt that i was speaking folly and yet it wasthe only real cause which i could suggest the professor sighed ahwell he said we must have more proof come with mehe put on the coffinlid again gathered up all his things and placedthem in the bag blew out the light and placed the candle also in thebag we opened the door and went out behind us he closed the door andlocked it he handed me the key saying will you keep it you hadbetter be assured i laughedit was not a very cheerful laugh i ambound to sayas i motioned him to keep it a key is nothing i saidthere may be duplicates and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lockof that kind he said nothing but put the key in his pocket then hetold me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch atthe other i took up my place behind a yewtree and i saw his darkfigure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from mysightit was a lonely vigil just after i had taken my place i heard a distantclock strike twelve and in time came one and two i was chilled andunnerved and angry with the professor for taking me on such an errandand with myself for coming i was too cold and too sleepy to be keenlyobservant and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether i hada dreary miserable timesuddenly as i turned round i thought i saw something like a whitestreak moving between two dark yewtrees at the side of the churchyardfarthest from the tomb at the same time a dark mass moved from theprofessors side of the ground and hurriedly went towards it then itoo moved but i had to go round headstones and railedoff tombs and istumbled over graves the sky was overcast and somewhere far off anearly cock crew a little way off beyond a line of scatteredjunipertrees which marked the pathway to the church a white dimfigure flitted in the direction of the tomb the tomb itself was hiddenby trees and i could not see where the figure disappeared i heard therustle of actual movement where i had first seen the white figure andcoming over found the professor holding in his arms a tiny child whenhe saw me he held it out to me and saidare you satisfied nowno i said in a way that i felt was aggressivedo you not see the childyes it is a child but who brought it here and is it wounded iaskedwe shall see said the professor and with one impulse we took our wayout of the churchyard he carrying the sleeping childwhen we had got some little distance away we went into a clump oftrees and struck a match and looked at the childs throat it waswithout a scratch or scar of any kindwas i right i asked triumphantlywe were just in time said the professor thankfullywe had now to decide what we were to do with the child and so consultedabout it if we were to take it to a policestation we should have togive some account of our movements during the night at least we shouldhave had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the childso finally we decided that we would take it to the heath and when weheard a policeman coming would leave it where he could not fail to findit we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could all fell outwell at the edge of hampstead heath we heard a policemans heavytramp and laying the child on the pathway we waited and watched untilhe saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro we heard his exclamationof astonishment and then we went away silently by good chance we got acab near the spaniards and drove to towni cannot sleep so i make this entry but i must try to get a few hourssleep as van helsing is to call for me at noon he insists that i shallgo with him on another expedition                                    septemberit was two oclock before we found a suitableopportunity for our attempt the funeral held at noon was all completedand the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazilyaway when looking carefully from behind a clump of aldertrees we sawthe sexton lock the gate after him we knew then that we were safe tillmorning did we desire it but the professor told me that we should notwant more than an hour at most again i felt that horrid sense of thereality of things in which any effort of imagination seemed out ofplace and i realised distinctly the perils of the law which we wereincurring in our unhallowed work besides i felt it was all so uselessoutrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin to see if a woman deadnearly a week were really dead it now seemed the height of folly toopen the tomb again when we knew from the evidence of our owneyesight that the coffin was empty i shrugged my shoulders howeverand rested silent for van helsing had a way of going on his own roadno matter who remonstrated he took the key opened the vault and againcourteously motioned me to precede the place was not so gruesome aslast night but oh how unutterably meanlooking when the sunshinestreamed in van helsing walked over to lucys coffin and i followedhe bent over and again forced back the leaden flange and then a shockof surprise and dismay shot through methere lay lucy seemingly just as we had seen her the night before herfuneral she was if possible more radiantly beautiful than ever and icould not believe that she was dead the lips were red nay redder thanbefore and on the cheeks was a delicate bloomis this a juggle i said to himare you convinced now said the professor in response and as he spokehe put over his hand and in a way that made me shudder pulled back thedead lips and showed the white teethsee he went on see they are even sharper than before with thisand thisand he touched one of the canine teeth and that belowitthe little children can be bitten are you of belief now friendjohn once more argumentative hostility woke within me i could notaccept such an overwhelming idea as he suggested so with an attempt toargue of which i was even at the moment ashamed i saidshe may have been placed here since last nightindeed that is so and by whomi do not know some one has done itand yet she has been dead one week most peoples in that time would notlook so i had no answer for this so was silent van helsing did notseem to notice my silence at any rate he showed neither chagrin nortriumph he was looking intently at the face of the dead woman raisingthe eyelids and looking at the eyes and once more opening the lips andexamining the teeth then he turned to me and saidhere there is one thing which is different from all recorded here issome dual life that is not as the common she was bitten by the vampirewhen she was in a trance sleepwalkingoh you start you do not knowthat friend john but you shall know it all laterand in trance couldhe best come to take more blood in trance she died and in trance sheis undead too so it is that she differ from all other usually whenthe undead sleep at homeas he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep ofhis arm to designate what to a vampire was hometheir face show whatthey are but this so sweet that was when she not undead she go back tothe nothings of the common dead there is no malign there see and soit make hard that i must kill her in her sleep this turned my bloodcold and it began to dawn upon me that i was accepting van helsingstheories but if she were really dead what was there of terror in theidea of killing her he looked up at me and evidently saw the change inmy face for he said almost joyouslyah you believe nowi answered do not press me too hard all at once i am willing toaccept how will you do this bloody worki shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic and i shalldrive a stake through her body it made me shudder to think of somutilating the body of the woman whom i had loved and yet the feelingwas not so strong as i had expected i was in fact beginning toshudder at the presence of this being this undead as van helsingcalled it and to loathe it is it possible that love is all subjectiveor all objectivei waited a considerable time for van helsing to begin but he stood asif wrapped in thought presently he closed the catch of his bag with asnap and saidi have been thinking and have made up my mind as to what is best if idid simply follow my inclining i would do now at this moment what isto be done but there are other things to follow and things that arethousand times more difficult in that them we do not know this issimple she have yet no life taken though that is of time and to actnow would be to take danger from her for ever but then we may have towant arthur and how shall we tell him of this if you who saw thewounds on lucys throat and saw the wounds so similar on the childs atthe hospital if you who saw the coffin empty last night and fulltoday with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and morebeautiful in a whole week after she dieif you know of this and knowof the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyardand yet of your own senses you did not believe how then can i expectarthur who know none of those things to believe he doubted me when itook him from her kiss when she was dying i know he has forgiven mebecause in some mistaken idea i have done things that prevent him saygoodbye as he ought and he may think that in some more mistaken ideathis woman was buried alive and that in most mistake of all we havekilled her he will then argue back that it is we mistaken ones thathave killed her by our ideas and so he will be much unhappy always yethe never can be sure and that is the worst of all and he willsometimes think that she he loved was buried alive and that will painthis dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered and again hewill think that we may be right and that his so beloved was after allan undead no i told him once and since then i learn much now sincei know it is all true a hundred thousand times more do i know that hemust pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet he poor fellowmust have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black tohim then we can act for good all round and send him peace my mind ismade up let us go you return home for tonight to your asylum and seethat all be well as for me i shall spend the night here in thischurchyard in my own way tomorrow night you will come to me to theberkeley hotel at ten of the clock i shall send for arthur to come tooand also that so fine young man of america that gave his blood later weshall all have work to do i come with you so far as piccadilly andthere dine for i must be back here before the sun setso we locked the tomb and came away and got over the wall of thechurchyard which was not much of a task and drove back to piccadillynote left by van helsing in his portmanteau berkeley hotel directed tojohn seward m dnot delivered septemberfriend johni write this in case anything should happen i go alone to watch inthat churchyard it pleases me that the undead miss lucy shall notleave tonight that so on the morrow night she may be more eagertherefore i shall fix some things she like notgarlic and acrucifixand so seal up the door of the tomb she is young as undeadand will heed moreover these are only to prevent her coming out theymay not prevail on her wanting to get in for then the undead isdesperate and must find the line of least resistance whatsoever it maybe i shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after the sunriseand if there be aught that may be learned i shall learn it for misslucy or from her i have no fear but that other to whom is there thatshe is undead he have now the power to seek her tomb and find shelterhe is cunning as i know from mr jonathan and from the way that allalong he have fooled us when he played with us for miss lucys life andwe lost and in many ways the undead are strong he have always thestrength in his hand of twenty men even we four who gave our strengthto miss lucy it also is all to him besides he can summon his wolf andi know not what so if it be that he come thither on this night he shallfind me but none other shalluntil it be too late but it may be thathe will not attempt the place there is no reason why he should hishunting ground is more full of game than the churchyard where theundead woman sleep and the one old man watchtherefore i write this in case take the papers that are with thisthe diaries of harker and the rest and read them and then find thisgreat undead and cut off his head and burn his heart or drive a stakethrough it so that the world may rest from himif it be so farewellvan helsingdr sewards diary septemberit is wonderful what a good nights sleep will do forone yesterday i was almost willing to accept van helsings monstrousideas but now they seem to start out lurid before me as outrages oncommon sense i have no doubt that he believes it all i wonder if hismind can have become in any way unhinged surely there must be somerational explanation of all these mysterious things is it possible thatthe professor can have done it himself he is so abnormally clever thatif he went off his head he would carry out his intent with regard tosome fixed idea in a wonderful way i am loath to think it and indeedit would be almost as great a marvel as the other to find that vanhelsing was mad but anyhow i shall watch him carefully i may get somelight on the mystery                                    september morning last night at a little before ten oclockarthur and quincey came into van helsings room he told us all that hewanted us to do but especially addressing himself to arthur as if allour wills were centred in his he began by saying that he hoped we wouldall come with him too for he said there is a grave duty to be donethere you were doubtless surprised at my letter this query wasdirectly addressed to lord godalmingi was it rather upset me for a bit there has been so much troublearound my house of late that i could do without any more i have beencurious too as to what you mean quincey and i talked it over but themore we talked the more puzzled we got till now i can say for myselfthat im about up a tree as to any meaning about anythingme too said quincey morris laconicallyoh said the professor then you are nearer the beginning both ofyou than friend john here who has to go a long way back before he caneven get so far as to beginit was evident that he recognised my return to my old doubting frame ofmind without my saying a word then turning to the other two he saidwith intense gravityi want your permission to do what i think good this night it is iknow much to ask and when you know what it is i propose to do you willknow and only then how much therefore may i ask that you promise mein the dark so that afterwards though you may be angry with me for atimei must not disguise from myself the possibility that such maybeyou shall not blame yourselves for anythingthats frank anyhow broke in quincey ill answer for the professori dont quite see his drift but i swear hes honest and thats goodenough for mei thank you sir said van helsing proudly i have done myself thehonour of counting you one trusting friend and such endorsement is dearto me he held out a hand which quincey tookthen arthur spoke outdr van helsing i dont quite like to buy a pig in a poke as theysay in scotland and if it be anything in which my honour as a gentlemanor my faith as a christian is concerned i cannot make such a promiseif you can assure me that what you intend does not violate either ofthese two then i give my consent at once though for the life of me icannot understand what you are driving ati accept your limitation said van helsing and all i ask of you isthat if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine you will firstconsider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate yourreservationsagreed said arthur that is only fair and now that thepourparlers are over may i ask what it is we are to doi want you to come with me and to come in secret to the churchyard atkingsteadarthurs face fell as he said in an amazed sort of waywhere poor lucy is buried the professor bowed arthur went on andwhen thereto enter the tomb arthur stood upprofessor are you in earnest or it is some monstrous joke pardon mei see that you are in earnest he sat down again but i could see thathe sat firmly and proudly as one who is on his dignity there wassilence until he asked againand when in the tombto open the coffinthis is too much he said angrily rising again i am willing to bepatient in all things that are reasonable but in thisthis desecrationof the graveof one who he fairly choked with indignation theprofessor looked pityingly at himif i could spare you one pang my poor friend he said god knows iwould but this night our feet must tread in thorny paths or later andfor ever the feet you love must walk in paths of flamearthur looked up with set white face and saidtake care sir take carewould it not be well to hear what i have to say said van helsingand then you will at least know the limit of my purpose shall i goonthats fair enough broke in morrisafter a pause van helsing went on evidently with an effortmiss lucy is dead is it not so yes then there can be no wrong toher but if she be not deadarthur jumped to his feetgood god he cried what do you mean has there been any mistake hasshe been buried alive he groaned in anguish that not even hope couldsofteni did not say she was alive my child i did not think it i go nofurther than to say that she might be undeadundead not alive what do you mean is this all a nightmare or whatis itthere are mysteries which men can only guess at which age by age theymay solve only in part believe me we are now on the verge of one buti have not done may i cut off the head of dead miss lucyheavens and earth no cried arthur in a storm of passion not forthe wide world will i consent to any mutilation of her dead body drvan helsing you try me too far what have i done to you that you shouldtorture me so what did that poor sweet girl do that you should want tocast such dishonour on her grave are you mad that speak such things oram i mad to listen to them dont dare to think more of such adesecration i shall not give my consent to anything you do i have aduty to do in protecting her grave from outrage and by god i shall doitvan helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated andsaid gravely and sternlymy lord godalming i too have a duty to do a duty to others a dutyto you a duty to the dead and by god i shall do it all i ask younow is that you come with me that you look and listen and if whenlater i make the same request you do not be more eager for itsfulfilment even than i am thenthen i shall do my duty whatever itmay seem to me and then to follow of your lordships wishes i shallhold myself at your disposal to render an account to you when and whereyou will his voice broke a little and he went on with a voice full ofpitybut i beseech you do not go forth in anger with me in a long life ofacts which were often not pleasant to do and which sometimes did wringmy heart i have never had so heavy a task as now believe me that ifthe time comes for you to change your mind towards me one look fromyou will wipe away all this so sad hour for i would do what a man canto save you from sorrow just think for why should i give myself somuch of labour and so much of sorrow i have come here from my own landto do what i can of good at the first to please my friend john andthen to help a sweet young lady whom too i came to love for heriam ashamed to say so much but i say it in kindnessi gave what yougave the blood of my veins i gave it i who was not like you herlover but only her physician and her friend i gave to her my nightsand daysbefore death after death and if my death can do her goodeven now when she is the dead undead she shall have it freely hesaid this with a very grave sweet pride and arthur was much affectedby it he took the old mans hand and said in a broken voiceoh it is hard to think of it and i cannot understand but at least ishall go with you and waitit was just a quarter before twelve oclock when we got into thechurchyard over the low wall the night was dark with occasional gleamsof moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded acrossthe sky we all kept somehow close together with van helsing slightlyin front as he led the way when we had come close to the tomb i lookedwell at arthur for i feared that the proximity to a place laden with sosorrowful a memory would upset him but he bore himself well i took itthat the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractantto his grief the professor unlocked the door and seeing a naturalhesitation amongst us for various reasons solved the difficulty byentering first himself the rest of us followed and he closed the doorhe then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin arthur steppedforward hesitatingly van helsing said to meyou were with me here yesterday was the body of miss lucy in thatcoffinit was the professor turned to the rest sayingyou hear and yet there is no one who does not believe with me hetook his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin arthurlooked on very pale but silent when the lid was removed he steppedforward he evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin orat any rate had not thought of it when he saw the rent in the leadthe blood rushed to his face for an instant but as quickly fell awayagain so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness he was still silentvan helsing forced back the leaden flange and we all looked in andrecoiledthe coffin was emptyfor several minutes no one spoke a word the silence was broken byquincey morrisprofessor i answered for you your word is all i want i wouldnt asksuch a thing ordinarilyi wouldnt so dishonour you as to imply adoubt but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonouris this your doingi swear to you by all that i hold sacred that i have not removed nortouched her what happened was this two nights ago my friend seward andi came herewith good purpose believe me i opened that coffin whichwas then sealed up and we found it as now empty we then waited andsaw something white come through the trees the next day we came here indaytime and she lay there did she not friend johnyesthat night we were just in time one more so small child was missingand we find it thank god unharmed amongst the graves yesterday i camehere before sundown for at sundown the undead can move i waited hereall the night till the sun rose but i saw nothing it was most probablethat it was because i had laid over the clamps of those doors garlicwhich the undead cannot bear and other things which they shun lastnight there was no exodus so tonight before the sundown i took away mygarlic and other things and so it is we find this coffin empty butbear with me so far there is much that is strange wait you with meoutside unseen and unheard and things much stranger are yet to besohere he shut the dark slide of his lanternnow to the outsidehe opened the door and we filed out he coming last and locking thedoor behind himoh but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror ofthat vault how sweet it was to see the clouds race by and the passinggleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing andpassinglike the gladness and sorrow of a mans life how sweet it wasto breathe the fresh air that had no taint of death and decay howhumanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill and tohear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city eachin his own way was solemn and overcome arthur was silent and was icould see striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of themystery i was myself tolerably patient and half inclined again tothrow aside doubt and to accept van helsings conclusions quinceymorris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things andaccepts them in the spirit of cool bravery with hazard of all he has tostake not being able to smoke he cut himself a goodsized plug oftobacco and began to chew as to van helsing he was employed in adefinite way first he took from his bag a mass of what looked likethin waferlike biscuit which was carefully rolled up in a whitenapkin next he took out a doublehandful of some whitish stuff likedough or putty he crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into themass between his hands this he then took and rolling it into thinstrips began to lay them into the crevices between the door and itssetting in the tomb i was somewhat puzzled at this and being closeasked him what it was that he was doing arthur and quincey drew nearalso as they too were curious he answeredi am closing the tomb so that the undead may not enterand is that stuff you have put there going to do it asked quinceygreat scott is this a gameit iswhat is that which you are using this time the question was byarthur van helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answeredthe host i brought it from amsterdam i have an indulgence it was ananswer that appalled the most sceptical of us and we felt individuallythat in the presence of such earnest purpose as the professors apurpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things it wasimpossible to distrust in respectful silence we took the placesassigned to us close round the tomb but hidden from the sight of anyone approaching i pitied the others especially arthur i had myselfbeen apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror and yet iwho had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs felt my heart sinkwithin me never did tombs look so ghastly white never did cypress oryew or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom never did treeor grass wave or rustle so ominously never did bough creak somysteriously and never did the faraway howling of dogs send such awoeful presage through the nightthere was a long spell of silence a big aching void and then from theprofessor a keen ssss he pointed and far down the avenue of yewswe saw a white figure advancea dim white figure which held somethingdark at its breast the figure stopped and at the moment a ray ofmoonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startlingprominence a darkhaired woman dressed in the cerements of the gravewe could not see the face for it was bent down over what we saw to be afairhaired child there was a pause and a sharp little cry such as achild gives in sleep or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams wewere starting forward but the professors warning hand seen by us ashe stood behind a yewtree kept us back and then as we looked thewhite figure moved forwards again it was now near enough for us to seeclearly and the moonlight still held my own heart grew cold as iceand i could hear the gasp of arthur as we recognised the features oflucy westenra lucy westenra but yet how changed the sweetness wasturned to adamantine heartless cruelty and the purity to voluptuouswantonness van helsing stepped out and obedient to his gesture weall advanced too the four of us ranged in a line before the door of thetomb van helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide by theconcentrated light that fell on lucys face we could see that the lipswere crimson with fresh blood and that the stream had trickled over herchin and stained the purity of her lawn deathrobewe shuddered with horror i could see by the tremulous light that evenvan helsings iron nerve had failed arthur was next to me and if i hadnot seized his arm and held him up he would have fallenwhen lucyi call the thing that was before us lucy because it bore hershapesaw us she drew back with an angry snarl such as a cat giveswhen taken unawares then her eyes ranged over us lucys eyes in formand colour but lucys eyes unclean and full of hellfire instead ofthe pure gentle orbs we knew at that moment the remnant of my lovepassed into hate and loathing had she then to be killed i could havedone it with savage delight as she looked her eyes blazed with unholylight and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile oh godhow it made me shudder to see it with a careless motion she flung tothe ground callous as a devil the child that up to now she hadclutched strenuously to her breast growling over it as a dog growlsover a bone the child gave a sharp cry and lay there moaning therewas a coldbloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from arthur whenshe advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fellback and hid his face in his handsshe still advanced however and with a languorous voluptuous gracesaidcome to me arthur leave these others and come to me my arms arehungry for you come and we can rest together come my husband comethere was something diabolically sweet in her tonessomething of thetingling of glass when struckwhich rang through the brains even of uswho heard the words addressed to another as for arthur he seemed undera spell moving his hands from his face he opened wide his arms shewas leaping for them when van helsing sprang forward and held betweenthem his little golden crucifix she recoiled from it and with asuddenly distorted face full of rage dashed past him as if to enterthe tombwhen within a foot or two of the door however she stopped as ifarrested by some irresistible force then she turned and her face wasshown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp which had now noquiver from van helsings iron nerves never did i see such baffledmalice on a face and never i trust shall such ever be seen again bymortal eyes the beautiful colour became livid the eyes seemed to throwout sparks of hellfire the brows were wrinkled as though the folds ofthe flesh were the coils of medusas snakes and the lovelybloodstained mouth grew to an open square as in the passion masks ofthe greeks and japanese if ever a face meant deathif looks couldkillwe saw it at that momentand so for full half a minute which seemed an eternity she remainedbetween the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means ofentry van helsing broke the silence by asking arthuranswer me oh my friend am i to proceed in my workarthur threw himself on his knees and hid his face in his hands as heanswereddo as you will friend do as you will there can be no horror likethis ever any more and he groaned in spirit quincey and isimultaneously moved towards him and took his arms we could hear theclick of the closing lantern as van helsing held it down coming closeto the tomb he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacredemblem which he had placed there we all looked on in horrifiedamazement as we saw when he stood back the woman with a corporealbody as real at that moment as our own pass in through the intersticewhere scarce a knifeblade could have gone we all felt a glad sense ofrelief when we saw the professor calmly restoring the strings of puttyto the edges of the doorwhen this was done he lifted the child and saidcome now my friends we can do no more till tomorrow there is afuneral at noon so here we shall all come before long after that thefriends of the dead will all be gone by two and when the sexton lockthe gate we shall remain then there is more to do but not like this oftonight as for this little one he is not much harm and by tomorrownight he shall be well we shall leave him where the police will findhim as on the other night and then to home coming close to arthurhe saidmy friend arthur you have had a sore trial but after when you lookback you will see how it was necessary you are now in the bitterwaters my child by this time tomorrow you will please god havepassed them and have drunk of the sweet waters so do not mournovermuch till then i shall not ask you to forgive mearthur and quincey came home with me and we tried to cheer each otheron the way we had left the child in safety and were tired so we allslept with more or less reality of sleep                                    september nighta little before twelve oclock we threearthurquincey morris and myselfcalled for the professor it was odd tonotice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes ofcourse arthur wore black for he was in deep mourning but the rest ofus wore it by instinct we got to the churchyard by halfpast one andstrolled about keeping out of official observation so that when thegravediggers had completed their task and the sexton under the beliefthat every one had gone had locked the gate we had the place all toourselves van helsing instead of his little black bag had with him along leather one something like a cricketing bag it was manifestly offair weightwhen we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out upthe road we silently and as if by ordered intention followed theprofessor to the tomb he unlocked the door and we entered closing itbehind us then he took from his bag the lantern which he lit and alsotwo wax candles which when lighted he stuck by melting their ownends on other coffins so that they might give light sufficient to workby when he again lifted the lid off lucys coffin we all lookedarthurtrembling like an aspenand saw that the body lay there in all itsdeathbeauty but there was no love in my own heart nothing butloathing for the foul thing which had taken lucys shape without hersoul i could see even arthurs face grow hard as he looked presentlyhe said to van helsingis this really lucys body or only a demon in her shapeit is her body and yet not it but wait a while and you all see heras she was and isshe seemed like a nightmare of lucy as she lay there the pointed teeththe bloodstained voluptuous mouthwhich it made one shudder toseethe whole carnal and unspiritual appearance seeming like adevilish mockery of lucys sweet purity van helsing with his usualmethodicalness began taking the various contents from his bag andplacing them ready for use first he took out a soldering iron and someplumbing solder and then a small oillamp which gave out when lit ina corner of the tomb gas which burned at fierce heat with a blueflame then his operating knives which he placed to hand and last around wooden stake some two and a half or three inches thick and aboutthree feet long one end of it was hardened by charring in the fire andwas sharpened to a fine point with this stake came a heavy hammer suchas in households is used in the coalcellar for breaking the lumps tome a doctors preparations for work of any kind are stimulating andbracing but the effect of these things on both arthur and quincey wasto cause them a sort of consternation they both however kept theircourage and remained silent and quietwhen all was ready van helsing saidbefore we do anything let me tell you this it is out of the lore andexperience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powersof the undead when they become such there comes with the change thecurse of immortality they cannot die but must go on age after ageadding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world for all thatdie from the preying of the undead becomes themselves undead and preyon their kind and so the circle goes on ever widening like as theripples from a stone thrown in the water friend arthur if you had metthat kiss which you know of before poor lucy die or again last nightwhen you open your arms to her you would in time when you had diedhave become nosferatu as they call it in eastern europe and wouldall time make more of those undeads that so have fill us with horrorthe career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun thosechildren whose blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse but ifshe live on undead more and more they lose their blood and by herpower over them they come to her and so she draw their blood with thatso wicked mouth but if she die in truth then all cease the tinywounds of the throats disappear and they go back to their playsunknowing ever of what has been but of the most blessed of all whenthis now undead be made to rest as true dead then the soul of the poorlady whom we love shall again be free instead of working wickedness bynight and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day sheshall take her place with the other angels so that my friend it willbe a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her freeto this i am willing but is there none amongst us who has a betterright will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of thenight when sleep is not it was my hand that sent her to the stars itwas the hand of him that loved her best the hand that of all she wouldherself have chosen had it been to her to choose tell me if there besuch a one amongst uswe all looked at arthur he saw too what we all did the infinitekindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restorelucy to us as a holy and not an unholy memory he stepped forward andsaid bravely though his hand trembled and his face was as pale assnowmy true friend from the bottom of my broken heart i thank you tell mewhat i am to do and i shall not falter van helsing laid a hand on hisshoulder and saidbrave lad a moments courage and it is done this stake must bedriven through her it will be a fearful ordealbe not deceived inthatbut it will be only a short time and you will then rejoice morethan your pain was great from this grim tomb you will emerge as thoughyou tread on air but you must not falter when once you have begun onlythink that we your true friends are round you and that we pray foryou all the timego on said arthur hoarsely tell me what i am to dotake this stake in your left hand ready to place the point over theheart and the hammer in your right then when we begin our prayer forthe deadi shall read him i have here the book and the others shallfollowstrike in gods name that so all may be well with the dead thatwe love and that the undead pass awayarthur took the stake and the hammer and when once his mind was set onaction his hands never trembled nor even quivered van helsing openedhis missal and began to read and quincey and i followed as well as wecould arthur placed the point over the heart and as i looked i couldsee its dint in the white flesh then he struck with all his mightthe thing in the coffin writhed and a hideous bloodcurdling screechcame from the opened red lips the body shook and quivered and twistedin wild contortions the sharp white teeth champed together till thelips were cut and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam but arthurnever faltered he looked like a figure of thor as his untrembling armrose and fell driving deeper and deeper the mercybearing stake whilstthe blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it hisface was set and high duty seemed to shine through it the sight of itgave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the littlevaultand then the writhing and quivering of the body became less and theteeth seemed to champ and the face to quiver finally it lay still theterrible task was overthe hammer fell from arthurs hand he reeled and would have fallen hadwe not caught him the great drops of sweat sprang from his foreheadand his breath came in broken gasps it had indeed been an awful strainon him and had he not been forced to his task by more than humanconsiderations he could never have gone through with it for a fewminutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards thecoffin when we did however a murmur of startled surprise ran from oneto the other of us we gazed so eagerly that arthur rose for he hadbeen seated on the ground and came and looked too and then a gladstrange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom ofhorror that lay upon itthere in the coffin lay no longer the foul thing that we had so dreadedand grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded as aprivilege to the one best entitled to it but lucy as we had seen her inher life with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity true thatthere were there as we had seen them in life the traces of care andpain and waste but these were all dear to us for they marked her truthto what we knew one and all we felt that the holy calm that lay likesunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token andsymbol of the calm that was to reign for evervan helsing came and laid his hand on arthurs shoulder and said tohimand now arthur my friend dear lad am i not forgiventhe reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old mans handin his and raising it to his lips pressed it and saidforgiven god bless you that you have given my dear one her soul againand me peace he put his hands on the professors shoulder and layinghis head on his breast cried for a while silently whilst we stoodunmoving when he raised his head van helsing said to himand now my child you may kiss her kiss her dead lips if you will asshe would have you to if for her to choose for she is not a grinningdevil nownot any more a foul thing for all eternity no longer she isthe devils undead she is gods true dead whose soul is with himarthur bent and kissed her and then we sent him and quincey out of thetomb the professor and i sawed the top off the stake leaving the pointof it in the body then we cut off the head and filled the mouth withgarlic we soldered up the leaden coffin screwed on the coffinlidand gathering up our belongings came away when the professor lockedthe door he gave the key to arthuroutside the air was sweet the sun shone and the birds sang and itseemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch there wasgladness and mirth and peace everywhere for we were at rest ourselveson one account and we were glad though it was with a tempered joybefore we moved away van helsing saidnow my friends one step of our work is done one the most harrowingto ourselves but there remains a greater task to find out the authorof all this our sorrow and to stamp him out i have clues which we canfollow but it is a long task and a difficult and there is danger init and pain shall you not all help me we have learned to believe allof usis it not so and since so do we not see our duty yes and dowe not promise to go on to the bitter endeach in turn we took his hand and the promise was made then said theprofessor as we moved offtwo nights hence you shall meet with me and dine together at seven ofthe clock with friend john i shall entreat two others two that youknow not as yet and i shall be ready to all our work show and our plansunfold friend john you come with me home for i have much to consultabout and you can help me tonight i leave for amsterdam but shallreturn tomorrow night and then begins our great quest but first ishall have much to say so that you may know what is to do and to dreadthen our promise shall be made to each other anew for there is aterrible task before us and once our feet are on the ploughshare wemust not draw backwhen we arrived at the berkeley hotel van helsing found a telegramwaiting for him     am coming up by train jonathan at whitby important newsmina     harkerthe professor was delighted ah that wonderful madam mina he saidpearl among women she arrive but i cannot stay she must go to yourhouse friend john you must meet her at the station telegraph her enroute so that she may be preparedwhen the wire was despatched he had a cup of tea over it he told me ofa diary kept by

we can then better enter on our inquisition keepthem safe for there is in them much of treasure you will need all yourfaith even you who have had such an experience as that of today whatis here told he laid his hand heavily and gravely on the packet ofpapers as he spoke may be the beginning of the end to you and me andmany another or it may sound the knell of the undead who walk theearth read all i pray you with the open mind and if you can add inany way to the story here told do so for it is allimportant you havekept diary of all these so strange things is it not so yes then weshall go through all these together when we meet he then made readyfor his departure and shortly after drove off to liverpool street itook my way to paddington where i arrived about fifteen minutes beforethe train came inthe crowd melted away after the bustling fashion common to arrivalplatforms and i was beginning to feel uneasy lest i might miss myguest when a sweetfaced daintylooking girl stepped up to me andafter a quick glance said dr seward is it notand you are mrs harker i answered at once whereupon she held outher handi knew you from the description of poor dear lucy but she stoppedsuddenly and a quick blush overspread her facethe blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease for itwas a tacit answer to her own i got her luggage which included atypewriter and we took the underground to fenchurch street after i hadsent a wire to my housekeeper to have a sittingroom and bedroomprepared at once for mrs harkerin due time we arrived she knew of course that the place was alunatic asylum but i could see that she was unable to repress a shudderwhen we enteredshe told me that if she might she would come presently to my study asshe had much to say so here i am finishing my entry in my phonographdiary whilst i await her as yet i have not had the chance of looking atthe papers which van helsing left with me though they lie open beforeme i must get her interested in something so that i may have anopportunity of reading them she does not know how precious time is orwhat a task we have in hand i must be careful not to frighten her hereshe ismina harkers journal septemberafter i had tidied myself i went down to dr sewardsstudy at the door i paused a moment for i thought i heard him talkingwith some one as however he had pressed me to be quick i knocked atthe door and on his calling out come in i enteredto my intense surprise there was no one with him he was quite aloneand on the table opposite him was what i knew at once from thedescription to be a phonograph i had never seen one and was muchinterestedi hope i did not keep you waiting i said but i stayed at the dooras i heard you talking and thought there was some one with youoh he replied with a smile i was only entering my diaryyour diary i asked him in surpriseyes he answered i keep it in this as he spoke he laid his hand onthe phonograph i felt quite excited over it and blurted outwhy this beats even shorthand may i hear it say somethingcertainly he replied with alacrity and stood up to put it in trainfor speaking then he paused and a troubled look overspread his facethe fact is he began awkwardly i only keep my diary in it and asit is entirelyalmost entirelyabout my cases it may be awkwardthatis i mean he stopped and i tried to help him out of hisembarrassmentyou helped to attend dear lucy at the end let me hear how she diedfor all that i know of her i shall be very grateful she was very verydear to meto my surprise he answered with a horrorstruck look in his facetell you of her death not for the wide worldwhy not i asked for some grave terrible feeling was coming over meagain he paused and i could see that he was trying to invent an excuseat length he stammered outyou see i do not know how to pick out any particular part of thediary even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him and he saidwith unconscious simplicity in a different voice and with the na√Øvet√©of a child thats quite true upon my honour honest indian i couldnot but smile at which he grimaced i gave myself away that time hesaid but do you know that although i have kept the diary for monthspast it never once struck me how i was going to find any particularpart of it in case i wanted to look it up by this time my mind wasmade up that the diary of a doctor who attended lucy might havesomething to add to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible being andi said boldlythen dr seward you had better let me copy it out for you on mytypewriter he grew to a positively deathly pallor as he saidno no no for all the world i wouldnt let you know that terriblestorythen it was terrible my intuition was right for a moment i thoughtand as my eyes ranged the room unconsciously looking for something orsome opportunity to aid me they lit on a great batch of typewriting onthe table his eyes caught the look in mine and without his thinkingfollowed their direction as they saw the parcel he realised my meaningyou do not know me i said when you have read those papersmy owndiary and my husbands also which i have typedyou will know mebetter i have not faltered in giving every thought of my own heart inthis cause but of course you do not know meyet and i must notexpect you to trust me so farhe is certainly a man of noble nature poor dear lucy was right abouthim he stood up and opened a large drawer in which were arranged inorder a number of hollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax andsaidyou are quite right i did not trust you because i did not know youbut i know you now and let me say that i should have known you longago i know that lucy told you of me she told me of you too may i makethe only atonement in my power take the cylinders and hear themthefirst halfdozen of them are personal to me and they will not horrifyyou then you will know me better dinner will by then be ready in themeantime i shall read over some of these documents and shall be betterable to understand certain things he carried the phonograph himself upto my sittingroom and adjusted it for me now i shall learn somethingpleasant i am sure for it will tell me the other side of a true loveepisode of which i know one side alreadydr sewards diary septemberi was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of jonathanharker and that other of his wife that i let the time run on withoutthinking mrs harker was not down when the maid came to announcedinner so i said she is possibly tired let dinner wait an hour andi went on with my work i had just finished mrs harkers diary whenshe came in she looked sweetly pretty but very sad and her eyes wereflushed with crying this somehow moved me much of late i have hadcause for tears god knows but the relief of them was denied me andnow the sight of those sweet eyes brightened with recent tears wentstraight to my heart so i said as gently as i couldi greatly fear i have distressed youoh no not distressed me she replied but i have been more touchedthan i can say by your grief that is a wonderful machine but it iscruelly true it told me in its very tones the anguish of your heartit was like a soul crying out to almighty god no one must hear themspoken ever again see i have tried to be useful i have copied out thewords on my typewriter and none other need now hear your heart beat asi didno one need ever know shall ever know i said in a low voice shelaid her hand on mine and said very gravelyah but they mustmust but why i askedbecause it is a part of the terrible story a part of poor dear lucysdeath and all that led to it because in the struggle which we havebefore us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have allthe knowledge and all the help which we can get i think that thecylinders which you gave me contained more than you intended me to knowbut i can see that there are in your record many lights to this darkmystery you will let me help will you not i know all up to a certainpoint and i see already though your diary only took me to  septemberhow poor lucy was beset and how her terrible doom was being wroughtout jonathan and i have been working day and night since professor vanhelsing saw us he is gone to whitby to get more information and hewill be here tomorrow to help us we need have no secrets amongst usworking together and with absolute trust we can surely be stronger thanif some of us were in the dark she looked at me so appealingly and atthe same time manifested such courage and resolution in her bearingthat i gave in at once to her wishes you shall i said do as youlike in the matter god forgive me if i do wrong there are terriblethings yet to learn of but if you have so far travelled on the road topoor lucys death you will not be content i know to remain in thedark nay the endthe very endmay give you a gleam of peace comethere is dinner we must keep one another strong for what is before uswe have a cruel and dreadful task when you have eaten you shall learnthe rest and i shall answer any questions you askif there be anythingwhich you do not understand though it was apparent to us who werepresentmina harkers journal septemberafter dinner i came with dr seward to his study hebrought back the phonograph from my room and i took my typewriter heplaced me in a comfortable chair and arranged the phonograph so that icould touch it without getting up and showed me how to stop it in casei should want to pause then he very thoughtfully took a chair with hisback to me so that i might be as free as possible and began to read iput the forked metal to my ears and listenedwhen the terrible story of lucys death andand all that followed wasdone i lay back in my chair powerless fortunately i am not of afainting disposition when dr seward saw me he jumped up with ahorrified exclamation and hurriedly taking a casebottle from acupboard gave me some brandy which in a few minutes somewhat restoredme my brain was all in a whirl and only that there came through allthe multitude of horrors the holy ray of light that my dear dear lucywas at last at peace i do not think i could have borne it withoutmaking a scene it is all so wild and mysterious and strange that if ihad not known jonathans experience in transylvania i could not havebelieved as it was i didnt know what to believe and so got out of mydifficulty by attending to something else i took the cover off mytypewriter and said to dr sewardlet me write this all out now we must be ready for dr van helsingwhen he comes i have sent a telegram to jonathan to come on here whenhe arrives in london from whitby in this matter dates are everythingand i think that if we get all our material ready and have every itemput in chronological order we shall have done much you tell me thatlord godalming and mr morris are coming too let us be able to tell himwhen they come he accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace and ibegan to typewrite from the beginning of the seventh cylinder i usedmanifold and so took three copies of the diary just as i had done withall the rest it was late when i got through but dr seward went abouthis work of going his round of the patients when he had finished hecame back and sat near me reading so that i did not feel too lonelywhilst i worked how good and thoughtful he is the world seems full ofgood meneven if there are monsters in it before i left him iremembered what jonathan put in his diary of the professorsperturbation at reading something in an evening paper at the station atexeter so seeing that dr seward keeps his newspapers i borrowed thefiles of the westminster gazette and the pall mall gazette and tookthem to my room i remember how much the dailygraph and the whitbygazette of which i had made cuttings helped us to understand theterrible events at whitby when count dracula landed so i shall lookthrough the evening papers since then and perhaps i shall get some newlight i am not sleepy and the work will help to keep me quietdr sewards diary septembermr harker arrived at nine oclock he had got hiswifes wire just before starting he is uncommonly clever if one canjudge from his face and full of energy if this journal be trueandjudging by ones own wonderful experiences it must behe is also a manof great nerve that going down to the vault a second time was aremarkable piece of daring after reading his account of it i wasprepared to meet a good specimen of manhood but hardly the quietbusinesslike gentleman who came here today                                   laterafter lunch harker and his wife went back to their own roomand as i passed a while ago i heard the click of the typewriter theyare hard at it mrs harker says that they are knitting together inchronological order every scrap of evidence they have harker has gotthe letters between the consignee of the boxes at whitby and thecarriers in london who took charge of them he is now reading his wifestypescript of my diary i wonder what they make out of it here itis     strange that it never struck me that the very next house might be     the counts hidingplace goodness knows that we had enough clues     from the conduct of the patient renfield the bundle of letters     relating to the purchase of the house were with the typescript oh     if we had only had them earlier we might have saved poor lucy     stop that way madness lies harker has gone back and is again     collating his material he says that by dinnertime they will be     able to show a whole connected narrative he thinks that in the     meantime i should see renfield as hitherto he has been a sort of     index to the coming and going of the count i hardly see this yet     but when i get at the dates i suppose i shall what a good thing     that mrs harker put my cylinders into type we never could have     found the dates otherwise     i found renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands     folded smiling benignly at the moment he seemed as sane as any     one i ever saw i sat down and talked with him on a lot of     subjects all of which he treated naturally he then of his own     accord spoke of going home a subject he has never mentioned to my     knowledge during his sojourn here in fact he spoke quite     confidently of getting his discharge at once i believe that had i     not had the chat with harker and read the letters and the dates of     his outbursts i should have been prepared to sign for him after a     brief time of observation as it is i am darkly suspicious all     those outbreaks were in some way linked with the proximity of the     count what then does this absolute content mean can it be that     his instinct is satisfied as to the vampires ultimate triumph     stay he is himself zo√∂phagous and in his wild ravings outside the     chapel door of the deserted house he always spoke of master this     all seems confirmation of our idea however after a while i came     away my friend is just a little too sane at present to make it     safe to probe him too deep with questions he might begin to think     and then so i came away i mistrust these quiet moods of his so     i have given the attendant a hint to look closely after him and to     have a straitwaistcoat ready in case of needjonathan harkers journal september in train to londonwhen i received mr billingtonscourteous message that he would give me any information in his power ithought it best to go down to whitby and make on the spot suchinquiries as i wanted it was now my object to trace that horrid cargoof the counts to its place in london later we may be able to dealwith it billington junior a nice lad met me at the station andbrought me to his fathers house where they had decided that i muststay the night they are hospitable with true yorkshire hospitalitygive a guest everything and leave him free to do as he likes they allknew that i was busy and that my stay was short and mr billington hadready in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of boxesit gave me almost a turn to see again one of the letters which i hadseen on the counts table before i knew of his diabolical planseverything had been carefully thought out and done systematically andwith precision he seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle whichmight be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being carriedout to use an americanism he had taken no chances and the absoluteaccuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled was simply thelogical result of his care i saw the invoice and took note of itfifty cases of common earth to be used for experimental purposesalso the copy of letter to carter paterson and their reply of both ofthese i got copies this was all the information mr billington couldgive me so i went down to the port and saw the coastguards the customsofficers and the harbourmaster they had all something to say of thestrange entry of the ship which is already taking its place in localtradition but no one could add to the simple description fifty casesof common earth i then saw the stationmaster who kindly put me incommunication with the men who had actually received the boxes theirtally was exact with the list and they had nothing to add except thatthe boxes were main and mortal heavy and that shifting them was drywork one of them added that it was hard lines that there wasnt anygentleman suchlike as yourself squire to show some sort ofappreciation of their efforts in a liquid form another put in a riderthat the thirst then generated was such that even the time which hadelapsed had not completely allayed it needless to add i took carebefore leaving to lift for ever and adequately this source ofreproach                                    septemberthe stationmaster was good enough to give me a line tohis old companion the stationmaster at kings cross so that when iarrived there in the morning i was able to ask him about the arrival ofthe boxes he too put me at once in communication with the properofficials and i saw that their tally was correct with the originalinvoice the opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been herelimited a noble use of them had however been made and again i wascompelled to deal with the result in an ex post facto mannerfrom thence i went on to carter patersons central office where i metwith the utmost courtesy they looked up the transaction in theirdaybook and letterbook and at once telephoned to their kings crossoffice for more details by good fortune the men who did the teamingwere waiting for work and the official at once sent them over sendingalso by one of them the waybill and all the papers connected with thedelivery of the boxes at carfax here again i found the tally agreeingexactly the carriers men were able to supplement the paucity of thewritten words with a few details these were i shortly found connectedalmost solely with the dusty nature of the job and of the consequentthirst engendered in the operators on my affording an opportunitythrough the medium of the currency of the realm of the allaying at alater period this beneficial evil one of the men remarkedthat ere ouse guvnor is the rummiest i ever was in blyme but itaint been touched sence a hundred years there was dust that thick inthe place that you might have slep on it without urtin of yer bonesan the place was that neglected that yer might ave

darkhaving been in the house i could well believe him but if he knew whati know he would i think have raised his termsof one thing i am now satisfied that all the boxes which arrived atwhitby from varna in the demeter were safely deposited in the oldchapel at carfax there should be fifty of them there unless any havesince been removedas from dr sewards diary i feari shall try to see the carter who took away the boxes from carfax whenrenfield attacked them by following up this clue we may learn a gooddeal                                   latermina and i have worked all day and we have put all the papersinto ordermina harkers journal septemberi am so glad that i hardly know how to contain myselfit is i suppose the reaction from the haunting fear which i have hadthat this terrible affair and the reopening of his old wound might actdetrimentally on jonathan i saw him leave for whitby with as brave aface as i could but i was sick with apprehension the effort hashowever done him good he was never so resolute never so strong neverso full of volcanic energy as at present it is just as that dear goodprofessor van helsing said he is true grit and he improves understrain that would kill a weaker nature he came back full of life andhope and determination we have got everything in order for tonight ifeel myself quite wild with excitement i suppose one ought to pity anything so hunted as is the count that is just it this thing is nothumannot even beast to read dr sewards account of poor lucysdeath and what followed is enough to dry up the springs of pity inones heart                                   laterlord godalming and mr morris arrived earlier than weexpected dr seward was out on business and had taken jonathan withhim so i had to see them it was to me a painful meeting for itbrought back all poor dear lucys hopes of only a few months ago ofcourse they had heard lucy speak of me and it seemed that dr vanhelsing too has been quite blowing my trumpet as mr morrisexpressed it poor fellows neither of them is aware that i know allabout the proposals they made to lucy they did not quite know what tosay or do as they were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge so theyhad to keep on neutral subjects however i thought the matter over andcame to the conclusion that the best thing i could do would be to postthem in affairs right up to date i knew from dr sewards diary thatthey had been at lucys deathher real deathand that i need not fearto betray any secret before the time so i told them as well as icould that i had read all the papers and diaries and that my husbandand i having typewritten them had just finished putting them in orderi gave them each a copy to read in the library when lord godalming gothis and turned it overit does make a pretty good pilehe saiddid you write all this mrs harkeri nodded and he went oni dont quite see the drift of it but you people are all so good andkind and have been working so earnestly and so energetically that alli can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you i havehad one lesson already in accepting facts that should make a man humbleto the last hour of his life besides i know you loved my poor lucyhere he turned away and covered his face with his hands i could hearthe tears in his voice mr morris with instinctive delicacy just laida hand for a moment on his shoulder and then walked quietly out of theroom i suppose there is something in womans nature that makes a manfree to break down before her and express his feelings on the tender oremotional side without feeling it derogatory to his manhood for whenlord godalming found himself alone with me he sat down on the sofa andgave way utterly and openly i sat down beside him and took his hand ihope he didnt think it forward of me and that if he ever thinks of itafterwards he never will have such a thought there i wrong him iknow he never willhe is too true a gentleman i said to him for icould see that his heart was breakingi loved dear lucy and i know what she was to you and what you were toher she and i were like sisters and now she is gone will you not letme be like a sister to you in your trouble i know what sorrows you havehad though i
