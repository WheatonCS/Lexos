the ashhopper for to examine it  we went through the yardso as to see what the hounds would do  they knowed us and didnt makeno more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes byin the night  when we got to the cabin we took a look at the front andthe two sides and on the side i warnt acquainted withwhich was thenorth sidewe found a square windowhole up tolerable high with justone stout board nailed across it  i saysheres the ticket  this holes big enough for jim to get through if wewrench off the boardtom saysits as simple as tittattoe threeinarow and as easy asplaying hooky  i should hope we can find a way thats a little morecomplicated than that huck finnwell then i says how ll it do to saw him out the way i donebefore i was murdered that timethats more like he says  its real mysterious and troublesomeand good he says but i bet we can find a way thats twice as long there aint no hurry les keep on looking aroundbetwixt the hut and the fence on the back side was a leanto thatjoined the hut at the eaves and was made out of plank  it was as longas the hut but narrowonly about six foot wide  the door to it was atthe south end and was padlocked  tom he went to the soapkettle andsearched around and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid withso he took it and prized out one of the staples  the chain fell downand we opened the door and went in and shut it and struck a matchand see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadnt no connectionwith it and there warnt no floor to the shed nor nothing in it butsome old rusty playedout hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow the match went out and so did we and shoved in the staple again andthe door was locked as good as ever tom was joyful  he saysnow were all right  well dig him out  it ll take about a weekthen we started for the house and i went in the back dooryou only haveto pull a buckskin latchstring they dont fasten the doorsbut thatwarnt romantical enough for tom sawyer no way would do him but he mustclimb up the lightningrod  but after he got up half way about threetimes and missed fire and fell every time and the last time mostbusted his brains out he thought hed got to give it up but after hewas rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck and thistime he made the tripin the morning we was up at break of day and down to the nigger cabinsto pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed jimif itwas jim that was being fed  the niggers was just getting throughbreakfast and starting for the fields and jims nigger was piling upa tin pan with bread and meat and things and whilst the others wasleaving the key come from the housethis nigger had a goodnatured chuckleheaded face and his wool wasall tied up in little bunches with thread  that was to keep witchesoff  he said the witches was pestering him awful these nights andmaking him see all kinds of strange things and hear all kinds ofstrange words and noises and he didnt believe he was ever witched solong before in his life  he got so worked up and got to running on soabout his troubles he forgot all about what hed been agoing to do so tom sayswhats the vittles for  going to feed the dogsthe nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face like when youheave a brickbat in a mudpuddle and he saysyes mars sid a dog  curus dog too  does you want to go en look atimyesi hunched tom and whispersyou going right here in the daybreak  that warnt the planno it warnt but its the plan nowso drat him we went along but i didnt like it much  when we got inwe couldnt hardly see anything it was so dark but jim was there sureenough and could see us and he sings outwhy huck  en good lan ain dat misto tomi just knowed how it would be i just expected it  i didnt knownothing to do and if i had i couldnt a done it because that niggerbusted in and sayswhy de gracious sakes do he know you genlmenwe could see pretty well now  tom he looked at the nigger steady andkind of wondering and saysdoes who know uswhy disyer runaway niggeri dont reckon he does but what put that into your headwhat put it dar  didn he jis dis minute sing out like he knowedyoutom says in a puzzledup kind of waywell thats mighty curious  who sung out when did he sing out what did he sing out and turns to me perfectly cam and saysdid you hear anybody sing outof course there warnt nothing to be said but the one thing so i saysno i aint heard nobody say nothingthen he turns to jim and looks him over like he never see him beforeand saysdid you sing outno sah says jim i haint said nothing sahnot a wordno sah i haint said a worddid you ever see us beforeno sah not as i knows onso tom turns to the nigger which was looking wild and distressed andsays kind of severewhat do you reckons the matter with you anyway  what made you thinksomebody sung outoh its de dadblame witches sah en i wisht i was dead i do deys awluz at it sah en dey do mos kill me dey skyers me so please to dont tell nobody bout it sah er ole mars silas hell scoleme kase he say dey aint no witches  i jis wish to goodness he washeah nowden what would he say  i jis bet he couldn fine no way togit aroun it dis time  but its awluz jis so people dats sotstays sot dey wont look into nothnen fine it out fr deyselves enwhen you fine it out en tell um bout it dey doan blieve youtom give him a dime and said we wouldnt tell nobody and told him tobuy some more thread to tie up his wool with and then looks at jim andsaysi wonder if uncle silas is going to hang this nigger  if i was tocatch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away i wouldnt givehim up id hang him  and whilst the nigger stepped to the door tolook at the dime and bite it to see if it was good he whispers to jimand saysdont ever let on to know us  and if you hear any digging going onnights its us were going to set you freejim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it then the niggercome back and we said wed come again some time if the nigger wantedus to and he said he would more particular if it was dark because thewitches went for him mostly in the dark and it was good to have folksaround thenit would be most an hour yet till breakfast so we left and struck downinto the woods because tom said we got to have some light to see howto dig by and a lantern makes too much and might get us into troublewhat we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks thats calledfoxfire and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in adark place  we fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds and set downto rest and tom says kind of dissatisfiedblame it this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can beand so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan there aint no watchman to be druggednow there ought to be awatchman  there aint even a dog to give a sleepingmixture to  andtheres jim chained by one leg with a tenfoot chain to the leg of hisbed  why all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip offthe chain  and uncle silas he trusts everybody sends the key to thepunkinheaded nigger and dont send nobody to watch the nigger  jimcould a got out of that windowhole before this only there wouldnt beno use trying to travel with a tenfoot chain on his leg  why drat ithuck its the stupidest arrangement i ever see you got to invent allthe difficulties  well we cant help it we got to do the best we canwith the materials weve got anyhow theres one thingtheres morehonor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangerswhere there warnt one of them furnished to you by the people who it wastheir duty to furnish them and you had to contrive them all out of yourown head  now look at just that one thing of the lantern  when youcome down to the cold facts we simply got to let on that a lanternsresky  why we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted toi believe  now whilst i think of it we got to hunt up something tomake a saw out of the first chance we getwhat do we want of a sawwhat do we want of it  haint we got to saw the leg of jims bedoff so as to get the chain loosewhy you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chainoffwell if that aint just like you huck finn  you can get up theinfantschooliest ways of going at a thing  why haint you ever readany books at allbaron trenck nor casanova nor benvenuto chelleenynor henri iv nor none of them heroes  who ever heard of getting aprisoner loose in such an oldmaidy way as that  no the way all thebest authorities does is to saw the bedleg in two and leave it justso and swallow the sawdust so it cant be found and put some dirt andgrease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal cant seeno sign of its being sawed and thinks the bedleg is perfectly soundthen the night youre ready fetch the leg a kick down she goes slipoff your chain and there you are  nothing to do but hitch yourrope ladder to the battlements shin down it break your leg in themoatbecause a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short you knowandtheres your horses and your trusty vassles and they scoop you up andfling you across a saddle and away you go to your native langudoc ornavarre or wherever it is its gaudy huck  i wish there was a moatto this cabin if we get time the night of the escape well dig onei sayswhat do we want of a moat when were going to snake him out from underthe cabinbut he never heard me  he had forgot me and everything else  he hadhis chin in his hand thinking  pretty soon he sighs and shakes hishead then sighs again and saysno it wouldnt dothere aint necessity enough for itfor what  i sayswhy to saw jims leg off he saysgood land  i says why there aint no necessity for it  and whatwould you want to saw his leg off for anywaywell some of the best authorities has done it  they couldnt get thechain off so they just cut their hand off and shoved  and a leg wouldbe better still  but we got to let that go  there aint necessityenough in this case and besides jims a nigger and wouldntunderstand the reasons for it and how its the custom in europe sowell let it go  but theres one thinghe can have a rope ladder wecan tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough  and wecan send it to him in a pie its mostly done that way  and ive etworse pieswhy tom sawyer how you talk i says jim aint got no use for arope ladderhe has got use for it  how you talk you better say you dontknow nothing about it  hes got to have a rope ladder they all dowhat in the nation can he do with itdo with it  he can hide it in his bed cant he  thats what theyall do and hes got to too  huck you dont ever seem to want to doanything thats regular you want to be starting something fresh all thetime spose he dont do nothing with it aint it there in his bedfor a clew after hes gone and dont you reckon theyll want clews of course they will  and you wouldnt leave them any  that would be apretty howdydo wouldnt it  i never heard of such a thingwell i says if its in the regulations and hes got to haveit all right let him have it because i dont wish to go back on noregulations but theres one thing tom sawyerif we go to tearing upour sheets to make jim a rope ladder were going to get into troublewith aunt sally just as sure as youre born  now the way i look atit a hickrybark ladder dont cost nothing and dont waste nothingand is just as good to load up a pie with and hide in a straw tickas any rag ladder you can start and as for jim he aint had noexperience and so he dont care what kind of aoh shucks huck finn if i was as ignorant as you id keepstillthats what id do  who ever heard of a state prisoner escapingby a hickrybark ladder  why its perfectly ridiculouswell all right tom fix it your own way but if youll take myadvice youll let me borrow a sheet off of the clotheslinehe said that would do  and that gave him another idea and he saysborrow a shirt toowhat do we want of a shirt tomwant it for jim to keep a journal onjournal your grannyjim cant writespose he cant writehe can make marks on the shirt cant he ifwe make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old ironbarrelhoopwhy tom we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a betterone and quicker tooprisoners dont have geese running around the donjonkeep to pullpens out of you muggins  they always make their pens out of thehardest toughest troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick orsomething like that they can get their hands on and it takes them weeksand weeks and months and months to file it out too because theyve gotto do it by rubbing it on the wall  they wouldnt use a goosequillif they had it it aint regularwell then whatll we make him the ink out ofmany makes it out of ironrust and tears but thats the common sortand women the best authorities uses their own blood  jim can do thatand when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious messageto let the world know where hes captivated he can write it on thebottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window  theiron mask always done that and its a blame good way toojim aint got no tin plates  they feed him in a panthat aint nothing we can get him somecant nobody read his platesthat aint got anything to do with it huck finn  all hes got todo is to write on the plate and throw it out  you dont have to beable to read it why half the time you cant read anything a prisonerwrites on a tin plate or anywhere elsewell then whats the sense in wasting the plateswhy blame it all it aint the prisoners platesbut its somebodys plates aint itwell sposn it is  what does the prisoner care whosehe broke off there because we heard the breakfasthorn blowing  so wecleared out for the housealong during the morning i borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of theclothesline and i found an old sack and put them in it and we wentdown and got the foxfire and put that in too  i called it borrowingbecause that was what pap always called it but tom said it warntborrowing it was stealing  he said we was representing prisoners andprisoners dont care how they get a thing so they get it and nobodydont blame them for it either  it aint no crime in a prisoner tosteal the thing he needs to get away with tom said its his right andso as long as we was representing a prisoner we had a perfect right tosteal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselvesout of prison with  he said if we warnt prisoners it would be a verydifferent thing and nobody but a mean ornery person would steal whenhe warnt a prisoner  so we allowed we would steal everything there wasthat come handy  and yet he made a mighty fuss one day after thatwhen i stole a watermelon out of the niggerpatch and eat it and hemade me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what itwas for tom said that what he meant was we could steal anything weneeded well i says i needed the watermelon  but he said i didntneed it to get out of prison with theres where the difference was he said if id a wanted it to hide a knife in and smuggle it to jimto kill the seneskal with it would a been all right  so i let it go atthat though i couldnt see no advantage in my representing a prisonerif i got to set down and chaw over a lot of goldleaf distinctions likethat every time i see a chance to hog a watermelonwell as i was saying we waited that morning till everybody was settleddown to business and nobody in sight around the yard then tom hecarried the sack into the leanto whilst i stood off a piece to keepwatch  by and by he come out and we went and set down on the woodpileto talk  he sayseverythings all right now except tools and thats easy fixedtools  i saysyestools for whatwhy to dig with  we aint agoing to gnaw him out are weaint them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig anigger out with  i sayshe turns on me looking pitying enough to make a body cry and sayshuck finn did you ever hear of a prisoner having picks and shovelsand all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with now i want to ask youif you got any reasonableness in you at allwhatkind of a show would that give him to be a hero  why they might aswell lend him the key and done with it  picks and shovelswhy theywouldnt furnish em to a kingwell then i says if we dont want the picks and shovels what dowe wanta couple of caseknivesto dig the foundations out from under that cabin withyesconfound it its foolish tomit dont make no difference how foolish it is its the right wayandits the regular way  and there aint no other way that ever i heardof and ive read all the books that gives any information about thesethings they always dig out with a caseknifeand not through dirt mindyou generly its through solid rock  and it takes them weeks and weeksand weeks and for ever and ever  why look at one of them prisoners inthe bottom dungeon of the castle deef in the harbor of marseilles thatdug himself out that way how long was he at it you reckoni dont knowwell guessi dont know  a month and a halfthirtyseven yearand he come out in china  thats the kind  iwish the bottom of this fortress was solid rockjim dont know nobody in chinawhats that got to do with it  neither did that other fellow  butyoure always awandering off on a side issue  why cant you stick tothe main pointall righti dont care where he comes out so he comes out and jimdont either i reckon  but theres one thing anywayjims too old tobe dug out with a caseknife  he wont lastyes he will last too  you dont reckon its going to takethirtyseven years to dig out through a dirt foundation do youhow long will it take tomwell we cant resk being as long as we ought to because it maynttake very long for uncle silas to hear from down there by new orleans hell hear jim aint from there  then his next move will be toadvertise jim or something like that  so we cant resk being as longdigging him out as we ought to  by rights i reckon we ought to bea couple of years but we cant  things being so uncertain what irecommend is this  that we really dig right in as quick as we canand after that we can let on to ourselves that we was at itthirtyseven years  then we can snatch him out and rush him away thefirst time theres an alarm  yes i reckon that ll be the best waynow theres sense in that i says  letting on dont cost nothingletting on aint no trouble and if its any object i dont mindletting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year  it wouldnt strainme none after i got my hand in  so ill mosey along now and smouch acouple of caseknivessmouch three he says we want one to make a saw out oftom if it aint unregular and irreligious to sejest it i saystheres an old rusty sawblade around yonder sticking under theweatherboarding behind the smokehousehe looked kind of weary and discouragedlike and saysit aint no use to try to learn you nothing huck  run along andsmouch the knivesthree of them  so i done itas soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down thelightningrod and shut ourselves up in the leanto and got out ourpile of foxfire and went to work  we cleared everything out of theway about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log  tomsaid he was right behind jims bed now and wed dig in under it andwhen we got through there couldnt nobody in the cabin ever know therewas any hole there because jims counterpin hung down most to theground and youd have to raise it up and look under to see the hole so we dug and dug with the caseknives till most midnight and thenwe was dogtired and our hands was blistered and yet you couldnt seewed done anything hardly  at last i saysthis aint no thirtyseven year job this is a thirtyeight year jobtom sawyerhe never said nothing  but he sighed and pretty soon he stoppeddigging and then for a good little while i knowed that he was thinkingthen he saysit aint no use huck it aint agoing to work  if we was prisonersit would because then wed have as many years as we wanted and nohurry and we wouldnt get but a few minutes to dig every day whilethey was changing watches and so our hands wouldnt get blistered andwe could keep it up right along year in and year out and do it rightand the way it ought to be done  but we cant fool along we got torush we aint got no time to spare  if we was to put in anothernight this way wed have to knock off for a week to let our hands getwellcouldnt touch a caseknife with them soonerwell then what we going to do tomill tell you  it aint right and it aint moral and i wouldnt likeit to get out but there aint only just the one way  we got to dig himout with the picks and let on its caseknivesnow youre talking  i says your head gets leveler and levelerall the time tom sawyer i says  picks is the thing moral or nomoral and as for me i dont care shucks for the morality of it nohow when i start in to steal a nigger or a watermelon or a sundayschoolbook i aint no ways particular how its done so its done  what iwant is my nigger or what i want is my watermelon or what i want is mysundayschool book and if a picks the handiest thing thats the thingim agoing to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that sundayschoolbook out with and i dont give a dead rat what the authorities thinksabout it nutherwell he says theres excuse for picks and lettingon in a case likethis if it warnt so i wouldnt approve of it nor i wouldnt stand byand see the rules brokebecause right is right and wrong is wrongand a body aint got no business doing wrong when he aint ignorant andknows better  it might answer for you to dig jim out with a pickwithout any letting on because you dont know no better but itwouldnt for me because i do know better  gimme a caseknifehe had his own by him but i handed him mine  he flung it down andsaysgimme a caseknifei didnt know just what to dobut then i thought  i scratched aroundamongst the old tools and got a pickaxe and give it to him and he tookit and went to work and never said a wordhe was always just that particular  full of principleso then i got a shovel and then we picked and shoveled turn aboutand made the fur fly  we stuck to it about a half an hour which was aslong as we could stand up but we had a good deal of a hole to show forit when i got up stairs i looked out at the window and see tom doinghis level best with the lightningrod but he couldnt come it hishands was so sore  at last he saysit aint no use it cant be done  what you reckon i better do  cantyou think of no wayyes i says but i reckon it aint regular  come up the stairs andlet on its a lightningrodso he done itnext day tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the housefor to make some pens for jim out of and six tallow candles and ihung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance and stole three tinplates  tom says it wasnt enough but i said nobody wouldnt ever seethe plates that jim throwed out because theyd fall in the dogfenneland jimpson weeds under the windowholethen we could tote them back andhe could use them over again  so tom was satisfied  then he saysnow the thing to study out is how to get the things to jimtake them in through the hole i says when we get it donehe only just looked scornful and said something about nobody ever heardof such an idiotic idea and then he went to studying  by and by hesaid he had ciphered out two or three ways but there warnt no need todecide on any of them yet  said wed got to post jim firstthat night we went down the lightningrod a little after ten and tookone of the candles along and listened under the windowhole and heardjim snoring so we pitched it in and it didnt wake him  then wewhirled in with the pick and shovel and in about two hours and a halfthe job was done  we crept in under jims bed and into the cabin andpawed around and found the candle and lit it and stood over jim awhileand found him looking hearty and healthy and then we woke him up gentleand gradual  he was so glad to see us he most cried and called ushoney and all the pet names he could think of and was for having ushunt up a coldchisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right awayand clearing out without losing any time  but tom he showed him howunregular it would be and set down and told him all about our plansand how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm andnot to be the least afraid because we would see he got away sure so jim he said it was all right and we set there and talked over oldtimes awhile and then tom asked a lot of questions and when jim toldhim uncle silas come in every day or two to pray with him and auntsally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat andboth of them was kind as they could be tom saysnow i know how to fix it  well send you some things by themi said dont do nothing of the kind its one of the most jackassideas i ever struck but he never paid no attention to me went righton  it was his way when hed got his plans setso he told jim how wed have to smuggle in the ropeladder pie and otherlarge things by nat the nigger that fed him and he must be on thelookout and not be surprised and not let nat see him open them andwe would put small things in uncles coatpockets and he must steal themout and we would tie things to aunts apronstrings or put them in herapronpocket if we got a chance and told him what they would be andwhat they was for  and told him how to keep a journal on the shirt withhis blood and all that he told him everything  jim he couldnt seeno sense in the most of it but he allowed we was white folks and knowedbetter than him so he was satisfied and said he would do it all justas tom saidjim had plenty corncob pipes and tobacco so we had a right down goodsociable time then we crawled out through the hole and so home tobed with hands that looked like theyd been chawed  tom was in highspirits he said it was the best fun he ever had in his life and themost intellectural and said if he only could see his way to it we wouldkeep it up all the rest of our lives and leave jim to our children toget out for he believed jim would come to like it better and better themore he got used to it  he said that in that way it could be strung outto as much as eighty year and would be the best time on record  and hesaid it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in itin the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brasscandlestick into handy sizes and tom put them and the pewter spoon inhis pocket  then we went to the nigger cabins and while i got natsnotice off tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of acornpone that was in jims pan and we went along with nat to see howit would work and it just worked noble when jim bit into it it mostmashed all his teeth out and there warnt ever anything could a workedbetter tom said so himself jim he never let on but what it was onlyjust a piece of rock or something like that thats always getting intobread you know but after that he never bit into nothing but what hejabbed his fork into it in three or four places firstand whilst we was astanding there in the dimmish light here comes acouple of the hounds bulging in from under jims bed and they kept onpiling in till there was eleven of them and there warnt hardly roomin there to get your breath  by jings we forgot to fasten that leantodoor  the nigger nat he only just hollered witches once and keeledover on to the floor amongst the dogs and begun to groan like he wasdying  tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of jims meatand the dogs went for it and in two seconds he was out himself and backagain and shut the door and i knowed hed fixed the other door toothen he went to work on the nigger coaxing him and petting him andasking him if hed been imagining he saw something again  he raised upand blinked his eyes around and saysmars sid youll say is a fool but if i didnt blieve i see most amillion dogs er devils er somen i wisht i may die right heah in desetracks  i did mos sholy  mars sid i felt umi felt um sah deywas all over me  dad fetch it i jis wisht i could git my hans on oneer dem witches jis wunstony jis wunstits all id ast  but moslyi wisht deyd lemme lone

witchthingshannel m mars sid  what is you atalkin bout  i wouldnlay de weight er my finger on um not fr ten hundd thousn billiondollars i wouldntthat was all fixed  so then we went away and went to the rubbagepilein the back yard where they keep the old boots and rags and piecesof bottles and woreout tin things and all such truck and scratchedaround and found an old tin washpan and stopped up the holes as well aswe could to bake the pie in and took it down cellar and stole it fullof flour and started for breakfast and found a couple of shinglenailsthat tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name andsorrows on the dungeon walls with and dropped one of them in auntsallys apronpocket which was hanging on a chair and tother we stuckin the band of uncle silass hat which was on the bureau because weheard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway niggershouse this morning and then went to breakfast and tom dropped thepewter spoon in uncle silass coatpocket and aunt sally wasnt comeyet so we had to wait a little whileand when she come she was hot and red and cross and couldnt hardlywait for the blessing and then she went to sluicing out coffee with onehand and cracking the handiest childs head with her thimble with theother and saysive hunted high and ive hunted low and it does beat all what hasbecome of your other shirtmy heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things and a hardpiece of corncrust started down my throat after it and got met on theroad with a cough and was shot across the table and took one of thechildren in the eye and curled him up like a fishingworm and let a cryout of him the size of a warwhoop and tom he turned kinder blue aroundthe gills and it all amounted to a considerable state of things forabout a quarter of a minute or as much as that and i would a sold outfor half price if there was a bidder  but after that we was all rightagainit was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of colduncle silas he saysits most uncommon curious i cant understand it  i know perfectlywell i took it off becausebecause you haint got but one on  just listen at the man  i knowyou took it off and

pocket  she stoppedwith her mouth open and her hands up and as for me i wished i was injeruslem or somewheres but not long because she saysits just as i expected  so you had it in your pocket all the timeand like as not youve got the other things there too  howd it gettherei reely dont know sally he says kind of apologizing or you knowi would tell  i was astudying over my text in acts seventeen beforebreakfast and i reckon i put it in there not noticing meaning to putmy testament in and it must be so because my testament aint in butill go and see and if the testament is where i had it ill know ididnt put it in and that will show that i laid the testament down andtook up the spoon andoh for the lands sake  give a body a rest  go long now the wholekit and biling of ye and dont come nigh me again till ive got back mypeace of mindid a heard her if shed a said it to herself let alone speaking itout and id a got up and obeyed her if id a been dead  as we waspassing through the settingroom the old man he took up his hat and theshinglenail fell out on the floor and he just merely picked it up andlaid it on the mantelshelf and never said nothing and went out  tomsee him do it and remembered about the spoon and sayswell it aint no use to send things by him no more he aintreliable then he says  but he done us a good turn with the spoonanyway without knowing it and so well go and do him one without himknowing itstop up his ratholesthere was a noble good lot of them down cellar and it took us a wholehour but we done the job tight and good and shipshape  then we heardsteps on the stairs and blowed out our light and hid and here comesthe old man with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in totherlooking as absentminded as year before last  he went a mooning aroundfirst to one rathole and then another till hed been to them all then he stood about five minutes picking tallowdrip off of his candleand thinking  then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairssayingwell for the life of me i cant remember when i done it  i couldshow her now that i warnt to blame on account of the rats  but nevermindlet it go  i reckon it wouldnt do no goodand so he went on amumbling up stairs and then we left  he was amighty nice old man  and always istom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon but he saidwed got to have it so he took a think  when he had ciphered it outhe told me how we was to do then we went and waited around thespoonbasket till we see aunt sally coming and then tom went tocounting the spoons and laying them out to one side and i slid one ofthem up my sleeve and tom sayswhy aunt sally there aint but nine spoons yetshe saysgo long to your play and dont bother me  i know better i countedm myselfwell ive counted them twice aunty and i cant make but nineshe looked out of all patience but of course she come to countanybodywouldi declare to gracious ther aint but nine she says  why what inthe worldplague take the things ill count m againso i slipped back the one i had and when she got done counting shesayshang the troublesome rubbage thers ten now and she looked huffyand bothered both  but tom sayswhy aunty i dont think theres tenyou numskull didnt you see me count mi know butwell ill count m againso i smouched one and they come out nine same as the other time well she was in a tearing wayjust atrembling all over she was somad  but she counted and counted till she got that addled shed startto count in the basket for a spoon sometimes and so three times theycome out right and three times they come out wrong  then she grabbedup the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the catgalleywest and she said cler out and let her have some peace and ifwe come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner shed skinus  so we had the odd spoon and dropped it in her apronpocket whilstshe was agiving us our sailing orders and jim got it all right alongwith her shingle nail before noon  we was very well satisfied withthis business and tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it tookbecause he said now she couldnt ever count them spoons twice alikeagain to save her life and wouldnt believe shed counted them right ifshe did and said that after shed about counted her head off for thenext three days he judged shed give it up and offer to kill anybodythat wanted her to ever count them any moreso we put the sheet back on the line that night and stole one out ofher closet and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for acouple of days till she didnt know how many sheets she had any moreand she didnt care and warnt agoing to bullyrag the rest of hersoul out about it and wouldnt count them again not to save her lifeshe druther die firstso we was all right now as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoonand the candles by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixedupcounting and as to the candlestick it warnt no consequence it wouldblow over by and bybut that pie was a job we had no end of trouble with that pie  wefixed it up away down in the woods and cooked it there and we got itdone at last and very satisfactory too but not all in one day and wehad to use up three washpans full of flour before we got through andwe got burnt pretty much all over in places and eyes put out withthe smoke because you see we didnt want nothing but a crust and wecouldnt prop it up right and she would always cave in  but of coursewe thought of the right way at lastwhich was to cook the ladder tooin the pie  so then we laid in with jim the second night and toreup the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together and longbefore daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a personwith  we let on it took nine months to make itand in the forenoon we took it down to the woods but it wouldnt gointo the pie  being made of a whole sheet that way there was ropeenough for forty pies if wed a wanted them and plenty left overfor soup or sausage or anything you choose  we could a had a wholedinnerbut we didnt need it  all we needed was just enough for the pie andso we throwed the rest away  we didnt cook none of the pies in thewashpanafraid the solder would melt but uncle silas he had a noblebrass warmingpan which he thought considerable of because it belongedto one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over fromengland with william the conqueror in the mayflower or one of them earlyships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and thingsthat was valuable not on account of being any account because theywarnt but on account of them being relicts you know and we snakedher out private and took her down there but she failed on the firstpies because we didnt know how but she come up smiling on the lastone  we took and lined her with dough and set her in the coals andloaded her up with rag rope and put on a dough roof and shut down thelid and put hot embers on top and stood off five foot with the longhandle cool and comfortable and in fifteen minutes she turned out apie that was a satisfaction to look at but the person that et it wouldwant to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along for if that ropeladder wouldnt cramp him down to business i dont know nothing what imtalking about and lay him in enough stomachache to last him till nexttime toonat didnt look when we put the witch pie in jims pan and we put thethree tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles and so jimgot everything all right and as soon as he was by himself he bustedinto the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tickand scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of thewindowholemaking them pens was a distressid tough job and so was the saw and jimallowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all  thats theone which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall  but he had to haveit tom said hed got to there warnt no case of a state prisoner notscrabbling his inscription to leave behind and his coat of armslook at lady jane grey he says look at gilford dudley look at oldnorthumberland  why huck spose it is considerble troublewhatyou going to dohow you going to get around it  jims got to do hisinscription and coat of arms  they all dojim sayswhy mars tom i haint got no coat o arm i haint got nuffn but dishyer ole shirt en you knows i got to keep de journal on datoh you dont understand jim a coat of arms is very differentwell i says jims right anyway when he says he aint got no coatof arms because he hainti reckon i knowed that tom says but you bet hell have one beforehe goes out of thisbecause hes going out right and there aintgoing to be no flaws in his recordso whilst me and jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece jimamaking hisn out of the brass and i making mine out of the spoontom set to work to think out the coat of arms  by and by he said hedstruck so many good ones he didnt hardly know which to take but therewas one which he reckoned hed decide on  he sayson the scutcheon well have a bend or in the dexter base a saltiremurrey in the fess with a dog couchant for common charge and underhis foot a chain embattled for slavery with a chevron vert in achief engrailed and three invected lines on a field azure with thenombril points rampant on a dancette indented crest a runaway niggersable with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister and acouple of gules for supporters which is you and me motto maggiorefretta minore otto  got it out of a bookmeans the more haste theless speedgeewhillikins i says but what does the rest of it meanwe aint got no time to bother over that he says we got to dig inlike all gitoutwell anyway i says whats some of it  whats a fessa fessa fess isyou dont need to know what a fess is  ill showhim how to make it when he gets to itshucks tom i says i think you might tell a person  whats a barsinisteroh i dont know  but hes got to have it  all the nobility doesthat was just his way  if it didnt suit him to explain a thing to youhe wouldnt do it  you might pump at him a week it wouldnt make nodifferencehed got all that coat of arms business fixed so now he started in tofinish up the rest of that part of the work which was to plan out amournful inscriptionsaid jim got to have one like they all done  hemade up a lot and wrote them out on a paper and read them off so  here a captive heart busted   here a poor prisoner forsook bythe world and friends fretted his sorrowful life   here a lonelyheart broke and a worn spirit went to its rest after thirtysevenyears of solitary captivity   here homeless and friendless afterthirtyseven years of bitter captivity perished a noble strangernatural son of louis xivtoms voice trembled whilst he was reading them and he most broke downwhen he got done he couldnt no way make up his mind which one for jimto scrabble on to the wall they was all so good but at last he allowedhe would let him scrabble them all on  jim said it would take him ayear to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail and hedidnt know how to make letters besides but tom said he would blockthem out for him and then he wouldnt have nothing to do but justfollow the lines  then pretty soon he sayscome to think the logs aint agoing to do they dont have log wallsin a dungeon  we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock  well fetcha rockjim said the rock was worse than the logs he said it would take himsuch a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldnt ever get out but tom said he would let me help him do it  then he took a look tosee how me and jim was getting along with the pens  it was most peskytedious hard work and slow and didnt give my hands no show to getwell of the sores and we didnt seem to make no headway hardly so tomsaysi know how to fix it  we got to have a rock for the coat of arms andmournful inscriptions and we can kill two birds with that same rocktheres a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill and well smouch itand carve the things on it and file out the pens and the saw on ittooit warnt no slouch of an idea and it warnt no slouch of a grindstonenuther but we allowed wed tackle it  it warnt quite midnight yetso we cleared out for the mill leaving jim at work  we smouched thegrindstone and set out to roll her home but it was a most nation toughjob sometimes do what we could we couldnt keep her from fallingover and she come mighty near mashing us every time  tom said she wasgoing to get one of us sure before we got through  we got her halfway and then we was plumb played out and most drownded with sweat  wesee it warnt no use we got to go and fetch jim so he raised up hisbed and slid the chain off of the bedleg and wrapt it round and roundhis neck and we crawled out through our hole and down there and jimand me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing andtom superintended  he could outsuperintend any boy i ever see  heknowed how to do everythingour hole was pretty big but it warnt big enough to get the grindstonethrough but jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough  then tommarked out them things on it with the nail and set jim to work on themwith the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in theleanto for a hammer and told him to work till the rest of his candlequit on him and then he could go to bed and hide the grindstone underhis straw tick and sleep on it  then we helped him fix his chain backon the bedleg and was ready for bed ourselves  but tom thought ofsomething and saysyou got any spiders in here jimno sah thanks to
