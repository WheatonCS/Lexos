chat ofall things except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinitegeniality that i could see poor lucys pretense of animation merge intoreality then without any seeming change he brought the conversationgently round to his visit and suavely saidmy dear young miss i have the so great pleasure because you are somuch beloved that is much my dear ever were there that which i do notsee they told me you were down in the spirit and that you were of aghastly pale to them i say pouf and he snapped his fingers at meand went on but you and i shall show them how wrong they are how canheand he pointed at me with the same look and gesture as that withwhich once he pointed me out to his class on or rather after aparticular occasion which he never fails to remind me ofknow anythingof a young ladies he has his madams to play with and to bring themback to happiness and to those that love them it is much to do andoh but there are rewards in that we can bestow such happiness but theyoung ladies he has no wife nor daughter and the young do not tellthemselves to the young but to the old like me who have known so manysorrows and the causes of them so my dear we will send him away tosmoke the cigarette in the garden whiles you and i have little talk allto ourselves i took the hint and strolled about and presently theprofessor came to the window and called me in he looked grave butsaid i have made careful examination but there is no functionalcause with you i agree that there has been much blood lost it hasbeen but is not but the conditions of her are in no way anæmic i haveasked her to send me her maid that i may ask just one or two questionthat so i may not chance to miss nothing i know well what she will sayand yet there is cause there is always cause for everything i must

andyou are right to stick to it but if need be i shall send you word tocome at once to lucy so do not be overanxious unless you hear frommedr sewards diary septemberzoöphagous patient still keeps up our interest in himhe had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time justbefore the stroke of noon he began to grow restless the attendant knewthe symptoms and at once summoned aid fortunately the men came at arun and were just in time for at the stroke of noon he became soviolent that it took all their strength to hold him in about fiveminutes however he began to get more and more quiet and finally sankinto a sort of melancholy in which state he has remained up to now theattendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were reallyappalling i found my hands full when i got in attending to some of theother patients who were frightened by him indeed i can quiteunderstand the effect for the sounds disturbed even me though i wassome distance away it is now after the dinnerhour of the asylum andas yet my patient sits in a corner brooding with a dull sullenwoebegone look in his face which seems rather to indicate than to showsomething directly i cannot quite understand it                                   lateranother change in my patient at five oclock i looked in onhim and found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be hewas catching flies and eating them and was keeping note of his captureby making nailmarks on the edge of the door between the ridges ofpadding when he saw me he came over and apologised for his badconduct and asked me in a very humble cringing way to be led back tohis own room and to have his notebook again i thought it well tohumour him so he is back in his room with the window open he has thesugar of his tea spread out on the windowsill and is reaping quite aharvest of flies he is not now eating them but putting them into abox as of old and is already examining the corners of his room to finda spider i tried to get him to talk about the past few days for anyclue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me but he would notrise for a moment or two he looked very sad and said in a sort offaraway voice as though saying it rather to himself than to meall over all over he has deserted me no hope for me now unless i doit for myself then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way he saiddoctor wont you be very good to me and let me have a little moresugar i think it would be good for meand the flies i saidyes the flies like it too and i like the flies therefore i likeit and there are people who know so little as to think that madmen donot argue i procured him a double supply and left him as happy a manas i suppose any in the world i wish i could fathom his mind                                   midnightanother change in him i had been to see miss westenrawhom i found much better and had just returned and was standing at ourown gate looking at the sunset when once more i heard him yelling ashis room is on this side of the house i could hear it better than inthe morning it was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smokybeauty of a sunset over london with its lurid lights and inky shadowsand all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foulwater and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stonebuilding with its wealth of breathing misery and my own desolate heartto endure it all i reached him just as the sun was going down and fromhis window saw the red disc sink as it sank he became less and lessfrenzied and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that held him aninert mass on the floor it is wonderful however what intellectualrecuperative power lunatics have for within a few minutes he stood upquite calmly and looked around him i signalled to the attendants not tohold him for i was anxious to see what he would do he went straightover to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar then he took hisflybox and emptied it outside and threw away the box then he shutthe window and crossing over sat down on his bed all this surprisedme so i asked him are you not going to keep flies any moreno said he i am sick of all that rubbish he certainly is awonderfully interesting study i wish i could get some glimpse of hismind or of the cause of his sudden passion stop there may be a clueafter all if we can find why today his paroxysms came on at high noonand at sunset can it be that there is a malign influence of the sun atperiods which affects certain naturesas at times the moon does otherswe shall seetelegram seward london to van helsing amsterdam septemberpatient still better todaytelegram seward london to van helsing amsterdam septemberpatient greatly improved good appetite sleepsnaturally good spirits colour coming backtelegram seward london to van helsing amsterdam septemberterrible change for the worse come at once do notlose an hour i hold over telegram to holmwood till have seen you septembermy dear artmy news today is not so good lucy this morning had gone back a bitthere is however one good thing which has arisen from it mrswestenra was naturally anxious concerning lucy and has consulted meprofessionally about her i took advantage of the opportunity and toldher that my old master van helsing the great specialist was coming tostay with me and that i would put her in his charge conjointly withmyself so now we can come and go without alarming her unduly for ashock to her would mean sudden death and this in lucys weakcondition might be disastrous to her we are hedged in withdifficulties all of us my poor old fellow but please god we shallcome through them all right if any need i shall write so that if youdo not hear from me take it for granted that i am simply waiting fornews in hasteyours everjohn sewarddr sewards diary septemberthe first thing van helsing said to me when we met atliverpool street washave you said anything to our young friend the lover of herno i said i waited till i had seen you as i said in my telegram iwrote him a letter simply telling him that you were coming as misswestenra was not so well and that i should let him know if need beright my friend he said quite right better he not know as yetperhaps he shall never know i pray so but if it be needed then heshall know all and my good friend john let me caution you you dealwith the madmen all men are mad in some way or the other and inasmuchas you deal discreetly with your madmen so deal with gods madmentoothe rest of the world you tell not your madmen what you do nor whyyou do it you tell them not what you think so you shall keep knowledgein its place where it may restwhere it may gather its kind around itand breed you and i shall keep as yet what we know here and here hetouched me on the heart and on the forehead and then touched himselfthe same way i have for myself thoughts at the present later i shallunfold to youwhy not now i asked it may do some good we may arrive at somedecision he stopped and looked at me and saidmy friend john when the corn is grown even before it hasripenedwhile the milk of its motherearth is in him and the sunshinehas not yet begun to paint him with his gold the husbandman he pull theear and rub him between his rough hands and blow away the green chaffand say to you look hes good corn he will make good crop when thetime comes i did not see the application and told him so for replyhe reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully ashe used long ago to do at lectures and said the good husbandman tellyou so then because he knows but not till then but you do not find thegood husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow that is forthe children who play at husbandry and not for those who take it as ofthe work of their life see you now friend john i have sown my cornand nature has her work to do in making it sprout if he sprout at alltheres some promise and i wait till the ear begins to swell he brokeoff for he evidently saw that i understood then he went on and verygravelyyou were always a careful student and your casebook was ever morefull than the rest you were only student then now you are master andi trust that good habit have not fail remember my friend thatknowledge is stronger than memory and we should not trust the weakereven if you have not kept the good practise let me tell you that thiscase of our dear miss is one that may bemind i say may beof suchinterest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick thebeam as your peoples say take then good note of it nothing is toosmall i counsel you put down in record even your doubts and surmiseshereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess welearn from failure not from successwhen i described lucys symptomsthe same as before but infinitelymore markedhe looked very grave but said nothing he took with him abag in which were many instruments and drugs the ghastly paraphernaliaof our beneficial trade as he once called in one of his lectures theequipment of a professor of the healing craft when we were shown inmrs westenra met us she was alarmed but not nearly so much as iexpected to find her nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordainedthat even death has some antidote to its own terrors here in a casewhere any shock may prove fatal matters are so ordered that from somecause or other the things not personaleven the terrible change in herdaughter to whom she is so attacheddo not seem to reach her it issomething like the way dame nature gathers round a foreign body anenvelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil thatwhich it would otherwise harm by contact if this be an orderedselfishness then we should pause before we condemn any one for the viceof egoism for there may be deeper root for its causes than we haveknowledge ofi used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology and laid downa rule that she should not be present with lucy or think of her illnessmore than was absolutely required she assented readily so readily thati saw again the hand of nature fighting for life van helsing and i wereshown up to lucys room if i was shocked when i saw her yesterday iwas horrified when i saw her today she was ghastly chalkily pale thered seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums and the bones ofher face stood out prominently her breathing was painful to see orhear van helsings face grew set as marble and his eyebrows convergedtill they almost touched over his nose lucy lay motionless and did notseem to have strength to speak so for a while we were all silent thenvan helsing beckoned to me and we went gently out of the room theinstant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage tothe next door which was open then he pulled me quickly in with him andclosed the door my god he said this is dreadful there is no timeto be lost she will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heartsaction as it should be there must be transfusion of blood at once isit you or mei am younger and stronger professor it must be methen get ready at once i will bring up my bag i am preparedi went downstairs with him and as we were going there was a knock atthe halldoor when we reached the hall the maid had just opened thedoor and arthur was stepping quickly in he rushed up to me saying inan eager whisperjack i was so anxious i read between the lines of your letter andhave been in an agony the dad was better so i ran down here to see formyself is not that gentleman dr van helsing i am so thankful to yousir for coming when first the professors eye had lit upon him he hadbeen angry at his interruption at such a time but now as he took inhis stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood whichseemed to emanate from him his eyes gleamed without a pause he said tohim gravely as he held out his handsir you have come in time you are the lover of our dear miss she isbad very very bad nay my child do not go like that for hesuddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting you are tohelp her you can do more than any that live and your courage is yourbest helpwhat can i do asked arthur hoarsely tell me and i shall do it mylife is hers and i would give the last drop of blood in my body forher the professor has a strongly humorous side and i could from oldknowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answermy young sir i do not ask so much as thatnot the lastwhat shall i do there was fire in his eyes and his open nostrilquivered with intent van helsing slapped him on the shoulder comehe said you are a man and it is a man we want you are better thanme better than my friend john arthur looked bewildered and theprofessor went on by explaining in a kindly wayyoung miss is bad very bad she wants blood and blood she must haveor die my friend john and i have consulted and we are about to performwhat we call transfusion of bloodto transfer from full veins of one tothe empty veins which pine for him john was to give his blood as he isthe more young and strong than mehere arthur took my hand and wrungit hard in silencebut now you are here you are more good than usold or young who toil much in the world of thought our nerves are notso calm and our blood not so bright than yours arthur turned to himand saidif you only knew how gladly i would die for her you wouldunderstandhe stopped with a sort of choke in his voicegood boy said van helsing in the notsofaroff you will be happythat you have done all for her you love come now and be silent youshall kiss her once before it is done but then you must go and youmust leave at my sign say no word to madame you know how it is withher there must be no shock any knowledge of this would be one comewe all went up to lucys room arthur by direction remained outsidelucy turned her head and looked at us but said nothing she was notasleep but she was simply too weak to make the effort her eyes spoketo us that was all van helsing took some things from his bag and laidthem on a little table out of sight then he mixed a narcotic andcoming over to the bed said cheerilynow little miss here is your medicine drink it off like a goodchild see i lift you so that to swallow is easy yes she had madethe effort with successit astonished me how long the drug took to act this in fact markedthe extent of her weakness the time seemed endless until sleep began toflicker in her eyelids at last however the narcotic began to manifestits potency and she fell into a deep sleep when the professor wassatisfied he called arthur into the room and bade him strip off hiscoat then he added you may take that one little kiss whiles i bringover the table friend john help to me so neither of us looked whilsthe bent over hervan helsing turning to me saidhe is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need notdefibrinate itthen with swiftness but with absolute method van helsing performed theoperation as the transfusion went on something like life seemed to comeback to poor lucys cheeks and through arthurs growing pallor the joyof his face seemed absolutely to shine after a bit i began to growanxious for the loss of blood was telling on arthur strong man as hewas it gave me an idea of what a terrible strain lucys system musthave undergone that what weakened arthur only partially restored herbut the professors face was set and he stood watch in hand and withhis eyes fixed now on the patient and now on arthur i could hear my ownheart beat presently he said in a soft voice do not stir an instantit is enough you attend him i will look to her when all was over icould see how much arthur was weakened i dressed the wound and took hisarm to bring him away when van helsing spoke without turning roundtheman seems to have eyes in the back of his headthe brave lover i think deserve another kiss which he shall havepresently and as he had now finished his operation he adjusted thepillow to the patients head as he did so the narrow black velvet bandwhich she seems always to wear round her throat buckled with an olddiamond buckle which her lover had given her was dragged a little upand showed a red mark on her throat arthur did not notice it but icould hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of van helsingsways of betraying emotion he said nothing at the moment but turned tome saying now take down our brave young lover give him of the portwine and let him lie down a while he must then go home and rest sleepmuch and eat much that he may be recruited of what he has so given tohis love he must not stay here hold a moment i may take it sirthat you are anxious of result then bring it with you that in all waysthe operation is successful you have saved her life this time and youcan go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is i shall tellher all when she is well she shall love you none the less for what youhave done goodbyewhen arthur had gone i went back to the room lucy was sleeping gentlybut her breathing was stronger i could see the counterpane move as herbreast heaved by the bedside sat van helsing looking at her intentlythe velvet band again covered the red mark i asked the professor in awhisperwhat do you make of that mark on her throatwhat do you make of iti have not examined it yet i answered and then and there proceededto loose the band just over the external jugular vein there were twopunctures not large but not wholesomelooking there was no sign ofdisease but the edges were white and wornlooking as if by sometrituration it at once occurred to me that this wound or whatever itwas might be the means of that manifest loss of blood but i abandonedthe idea as soon as formed for such a thing could not be the whole bedwould have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl musthave lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusionwell said van helsingwell said i i can make nothing of it the professor stood up imust go back to amsterdam tonight he said there are books andthings there which i want you must remain here all the night and youmust not let your sight pass from hershall i have a nurse i askedwe are the best nurses you and i you keep watch all night see thatshe is well fed and that nothing disturbs her you must not sleep allthe night later on we can sleep you and i i shall be back as soon aspossible and then we may beginmay begin i said what on earth do you meanwe shall see he answered as he hurried out he came back a momentlater and put his head inside the door and said with warning finger heldupremember she is your charge if you leave her and harm befall youshall not sleep easy hereafterdr sewards diarycontinued septemberi sat up all night with lucy the opiate worked itselfoff towards dusk and she waked naturally she looked a different beingfrom what she had been before the operation her spirits even were goodand she was full of a happy vivacity but i could see evidences of theabsolute prostration which she had undergone when i told mrs westenrathat dr van helsing had directed that i should sit up with her shealmost poohpoohed the idea pointing out her daughters renewedstrength and excellent spirits i was firm however and madepreparations for my long vigil when her maid had prepared her for thenight i came in having in the meantime had supper and took a seat bythe bedside she did not in any way make objection but looked at megratefully whenever i caught her eye after a long spell she seemedsinking off to sleep but with an effort seemed to pull herself togetherand shook it off this was repeated several times with greater effortand with shorter pauses as the time moved on it was apparent that shedid not want to sleep so i tackled the subject at onceyou do not want to go to sleepno i am afraidafraid to go to sleep why so it is the boon we all crave forah not if you were like meif sleep was to you a presage of horrora presage of horror what on earth do you meani dont know oh i dont know and that is what is so terrible allthis weakness comes to me in sleep until i dread the very thoughtbut my dear girl you may sleep tonight i am here watching you andi can promise that nothing will happenah i can trust you i seized the opportunity and said i promiseyou that if i see any evidence of bad dreams i will wake you at onceyou will oh will you really how good you are to me then i willsleep and almost at the word she gave a deep sigh of relief and sankback asleepall night long i watched by her she never stirred but slept on and onin a deep tranquil lifegiving healthgiving sleep her lips wereslightly parted and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of apendulum there was a smile on her face and it was evident that no baddreams had come to disturb her peace of mindin the early morning her maid came and i left her in her care and tookmyself back home for i was anxious about many things i sent a shortwire to van helsing and to arthur telling them of the excellent resultof the operation my own work with its manifold arrears took me allday to clear off it was dark when i was able to inquire about myzoöphagous patient the report was good he had been quite quiet for thepast day and night a telegram came from van helsing at amsterdam whilsti was at dinner suggesting that i should be at hillingham tonight asit might be well to be at hand and stating that he was leaving by thenight mail and would join me early in the morning                                    septemberi was pretty tired and worn out when i got tohillingham for two nights i had hardly had a wink of sleep and mybrain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebralexhaustion lucy was up and in cheerful spirits when she shook handswith me she looked sharply in my face and saidno sitting up tonight for you you are worn out i am quite wellagain indeed i am and if there is to be any sitting up it is i whowill sit up with you i would not argue the point but went and had mysupper lucy came with me and enlivened by her charming presence imade an excellent meal and had a couple of glasses of the more thanexcellent port then lucy took me upstairs and showed me a room nexther own where a cozy fire was burning now she said you must stayhere i shall leave this door open and my door too you can lie on thesofa for i know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go tobed whilst there is a patient above the horizon if i want anything ishall call out and you can come to me at once i could not butacquiesce for i was dogtired and could not have sat up had i triedso on her renewing her promise to call me if she should want anythingi lay on the sofa and forgot all about everythinglucy westenras diary septemberi feel so happy tonight i have been so miserably weakthat to be able to think and move about is like feeling sunshine aftera long spell of east wind out of a steel sky somehow arthur feels veryvery close to me i seem to feel his presence warm about me i supposeit is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn our innereyes and sympathy on ourselves whilst health and strength give loverein and in thought and feeling he can wander where he wills i knowwhere my thoughts are if arthur only knew my dear my dear your earsmust tingle as you sleep as mine do waking oh the blissful rest oflast night how i slept with that dear good dr seward watching meand tonight i shall not fear to sleep since he is close at hand andwithin call thank everybody for being so good to me thank godgoodnight arthurdr sewards diary septemberi was conscious of the professors hand on my head andstarted awake all in a second that is one of the things that we learnin an asylum at any rateand how is our patientwell when i left her or rather when she left me i answeredcome let us see he said and together we went into the roomthe blind was down and i went over to raise it gently whilst vanhelsing stepped with his soft catlike tread over to the bedas i raised the blind and the morning sunlight flooded the room iheard the professors low hiss of inspiration and knowing its rarity adeadly fear shot through my heart as i passed over he moved back andhis exclamation of horror gott in himmel needed no enforcement fromhis agonised face he raised his hand and pointed to the bed and hisiron face was drawn and ashen white i felt my knees begin to tremblethere on the bed seemingly in a swoon lay poor lucy more horriblywhite and wanlooking than ever even the lips were white and the gumsseemed to have shrunken back from the teeth as we sometimes see in acorpse after a prolonged illness van helsing raised his foot to stampin anger but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habitstood to him and he put it down again softly quick he said bringthe brandy i flew to the diningroom and returned with the decanterhe wetted the poor white lips with it and together we rubbed palm andwrist and heart he felt her heart and after a few moments of agonisingsuspense saidit is not too late it beats though but feebly all our work isundone we must begin again there is no young arthur here now i haveto call on you yourself this time friend john as he spoke he wasdipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion ihad taken off my coat and rolled up my shirtsleeve there was nopossibility of an opiate just at present and no need of one and sowithout a moments delay we began the operation after a timeit didnot seem a short time either for the draining away of ones blood nomatter how willingly it be given is a terrible feelingvan helsingheld up a warning finger do not stir he said but i fear that withgrowing strength she may wake and that would make danger oh so muchdanger but i shall precaution take i shall give hypodermic injectionof morphia he proceeded then swiftly and deftly to carry out hisintent the effect on lucy was not bad for the faint seemed to mergesubtly into the narcotic sleep it was with a feeling of personal pridethat i could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallidcheeks and lips no man knows till he experiences it what it is tofeel his own lifeblood drawn away into the veins of the woman he lovesthe professor watched me critically that will do he said alreadyi remonstrated you took a great deal more from art to which hesmiled a sad sort of smile as he repliedhe is her lover her fiancé you have work much work to do for herand for others and the present will sufficewhen we stopped the operation he attended to lucy whilst i applieddigital pressure to my own incision i laid down whilst i waited hisleisure to attend to me for i felt faint and a little sick byandbyhe bound up my wound and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine formyself as i was leaving the room he came after me and halfwhisperedmind nothing must be said of this if our young lover should turn upunexpected as before no word to him it would at once frighten him andenjealous him too there must be none sowhen i came back he looked at me carefully and then saidyou are not much the worse go into the room and lie on your sofa andrest awhile then have much breakfast and come here to mei followed out his orders for i knew how right and wise they were ihad done my part and now my next duty was to keep up my strength ifelt very weak and in the weakness lost something of the amazement atwhat had occurred i fell asleep on the sofa however wondering overand over again how lucy had made such a retrograde movement and howshe could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere toshow for it i think i must have continued my wonder in my dreams forsleeping and waking my thoughts always came back to the littlepunctures in her throat and the ragged exhausted appearance of theiredgestiny though they werelucy slept well into the day and when she woke she was fairly well andstrong though not nearly so much so as the day before when van helsinghad seen her he went out for a walk leaving me in charge with strictinjunctions that i was not to leave her for a moment i could hear hisvoice in the hall asking the way to the nearest telegraph officelucy chatted with me freely and seemed quite unconscious that anythinghad happened i tried to keep her amused and interested when her mothercame up to see her she did not seem to notice any change whatever butsaid to me gratefullywe owe you so much dr seward for all you have done but you reallymust now take care not to overwork yourself you are looking paleyourself you want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit that youdo as she spoke lucy turned crimson though it was only momentarilyfor her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonteddrain to the head the reaction came in excessive pallor as she turnedimploring eyes on me i smiled and nodded and laid my finger on mylips with a sigh she sank back amid her pillowsvan helsing returned in a couple of hours and presently said to menow you go home and eat much and drink enough make yourself strong istay here tonight and i shall sit up with little miss myself you andi must watch the case and we must have none other to know i have gravereasons no do not ask them think what you will do not fear to thinkeven the most notprobable goodnightin the hall two of the maids came to me and asked if they or either ofthem might not sit up with miss lucy they implored me to let them andwhen i said it was dr van helsings wish that either he or i should situp they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the foreigngentleman i was much touched by their kindness perhaps it is becausei am weak at present and perhaps because it was on lucys account thattheir devotion was manifested for over and over again have i seensimilar instances of womans kindness i got back here in time for alate dinner went my roundsall well and set this down whilst waitingfor sleep it is coming                                    septemberthis afternoon i went over to hillingham found vanhelsing in excellent spirits and lucy much better shortly after i hadarrived a big parcel from abroad came for the professor he opened itwith much impressmentassumed of courseand showed a great bundle ofwhite flowersthese are for you miss lucy he saidfor me oh dr van helsingyes my dear but not for you to play with these are medicines herelucy made a wry face nay but they are not to take in a decoction orin nauseous form so you need not snub that so charming nose or i shallpoint out to my friend arthur what woes he may have to endure in seeingso much beauty that he so loves so much distort aha my pretty missthat bring the so nice nose all straight again this is medicinal butyou do not know how i put him in your window i make pretty wreath andhang him round your neck so that you sleep well oh yes they like thelotus flower make your trouble forgotten it smell so like the watersof lethe and of that fountain of youth that the conquistadores soughtfor in the floridas and find him all too latewhilst he was speaking lucy had been examining the flowers and smellingthem now she threw them down saying with halflaughter andhalfdisgustoh professor i believe you are only putting up a joke on me whythese flowers are only common garlicto my surprise van helsing rose up and said with all his sternness hisiron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meetingno trifling with me i never jest there is grim purpose in all i doand i warn you that you do not thwart me take care for the sake ofothers if not for your own then seeing poor lucy scared as she mightwell be he went on more gently oh little miss my dear do not fearme i only do for your good but there is much virtue to you in those socommon flowers see i place them myself in your room i make myself thewreath that you are to wear but hush no telling to others that make soinquisitive questions we must obey and silence is a part of obedienceand obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that waitfor you now sit still awhile come with me friend john and you shallhelp me deck the room with my garlic which is all the way from haarlemwhere my friend vanderpool raise herb in his glasshouses all the yeari had to telegraph yesterday or they would not have been herewe went into the room taking the flowers with us the professorsactions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopoeiathat i ever heard of first he fastened up the windows and latched themsecurely next taking a handful of the flowers he rubbed them all overthe sashes as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might getin would be laden with the garlic smell then with the wisp he rubbedall over the jamb of the door above below and at each side and roundthe fireplace in the same way it all seemed grotesque to me andpresently i saidwell professor i know you always have a reason for what you do butthis certainly puzzles me it is well we have no sceptic here or hewould say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spiritperhaps i am he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath whichlucy was to wear round her neckwe then waited whilst lucy made her toilet for the night and when shewas in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round herneck the last words he said to her weretake care you do not disturb it

and i arrived at hillingham ateight oclock it was a lovely morning the bright sunshine and all thefresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of naturesannual work the leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful coloursbut had not yet begun to drop from the trees when we entered we metmrs westenra coming out of the morning room she is always an earlyriser she greeted us warmly and saidyou will be glad to know that lucy is better the dear child is stillasleep i looked into her room and saw her but did not go in lest ishould disturb her the professor smiled and looked quite jubilant herubbed his hands together and saidaha i thought i had diagnosed the case my treatment is working towhich she answeredyou must not take all the credit to yourself doctor lucys state thismorning is due in part to mehow you do mean maam asked the professorwell i was anxious about the dear child in the night and went intoher room she was sleeping soundlyso soundly that even my coming didnot wake her but the room was awfully stuffy there were a lot of thosehorrible strongsmelling flowers about everywhere and she had actuallya bunch of them round her neck i feared that the heavy odour would betoo much for the dear child in her weak state so i took them all awayand opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air you will bepleased with her i am sureshe moved off into her boudoir where she usually breakfasted early asshe had spoken i watched the professors face and saw it turn ashengrey he had been able to retain his selfcommand whilst the poor ladywas present for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would behe actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass intoher room but the instant she had disappeared he pulled me suddenly andforcibly into the diningroom and closed the doorthen for the first time in my life i saw van helsing break down heraised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair and then beathis palms together in a helpless way finally he sat down on a chairand putting his hands before his face began to sob with loud dry sobsthat seemed to come from the very racking of his heart then he raisedhis arms again as though appealing to the whole universe god godgod he said what have we done what has this poor thing done thatwe are so sore beset is there fate amongst us still sent down from thepagan world of old that such things must be and in such way this poormother all unknowing and all for the best as she think does suchthing as lose her daughter body and soul and we must not tell her wemust not even warn her or she die and then both die oh how we arebeset how are all the powers of the devils against us suddenly hejumped to his feet come he said come we must see and act devilsor no devils or all the devils at once it matters not we fight himall the same he went to the halldoor for his bag and together wewent up to lucys roomonce again i drew up the blind whilst van helsing went towards the bedthis time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the sameawful waxen pallor as before he wore a look of stern sadness andinfinite pityas i expected he murmured with that hissing inspiration of his whichmeant so much without a word he went and locked the door and thenbegan to set out on the little table the instruments for yet anotheroperation of transfusion of blood i had long ago recognised thenecessity and begun to take off my coat but he stopped me with awarning hand no he said today you must operate i shall provideyou are weakened already as he spoke he took off his coat and rolledup his shirtsleeveagain the operation again the narcotic again some return of colour tothe ashy cheeks and the regular breathing of healthy sleep this time iwatched whilst van helsing recruited himself and restedpresently he took an opportunity of telling mrs westenra that she mustnot remove anything from lucys room without consulting him that theflowers were of medicinal value and that the breathing of their odourwas a part of the system of cure then he took over the care of the casehimself saying that he would watch this night and the next and wouldsend me word when to comeafter another hour lucy waked from her sleep fresh and bright andseemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordealwhat does it all mean i am beginning to wonder if my long habit of lifeamongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brainlucy westenras diary septemberfour days and nights of peace i am getting so strongagain that i hardly know myself it is as if i had passed through somelong nightmare and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine andfeel the fresh air of the morning around me i have a dimhalfremembrance of long anxious times of waiting and fearing darknessin which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distressmore poignant and then long spells of oblivion and the rising back tolife as a diver coming up through a great press of water sincehowever dr van helsing has been with me all this bad dreaming seemsto have passed away the noises that used to frighten me out of mywitsthe flapping against the windows the distant voices which seemedso close to me the harsh sounds that came from i know not where andcommanded me to do i know not whathave all ceased i go to bed nowwithout any fear of sleep i do not even try to keep

bilder lives in one of the cottages inthe enclosure behind the elephanthouse and was just sitting down tohis tea when i found him thomas and his wife are hospitable folkelderly and without children and if the specimen i enjoyed of theirhospitality be of the average kind their lives must be prettycomfortable the keeper would not enter on what he called businessuntil the supper was over and we were all satisfied then when thetable was cleared and he had lit his pipe he saidnow sir you can go on and arsk me what you want youll excoose merefoosin to talk of perfeshunal subjects afore meals i

you to say what youconsider was the cause of it and how you think the whole affair willendall right guvnor this ere is about the ole story that ere wolfwhat we called bersicker was one of three grey ones that came fromnorway to jamrachs which we bought off him four years ago he was anice wellbehaved wolf that never gave no trouble to talk of im moresurprised at im for wantin to get out nor any other animile in theplace but there you cant trust wolves no more nor womendont you mind him sir broke in mrs tom with a cheery laugh esgot mindin the animiles so long that blest if he aint like a old wolfisself but there aint no arm in imwell sir it was about two hours after feedin yesterday when i firsthear my disturbance i was makin up a litter in the monkeyhouse for ayoung puma which is ill but when i heard the yelpin and owlin i kemaway straight there was bersicker atearin like a mad thing at thebars as if he wanted to get out there wasnt much people about thatday and close at hand was only one man a tall thin chap with a ooknose and a pointed beard with a few white hairs runnin through it hehad a ard cold look and red eyes and i took a sort of mislike to himfor it seemed as if it was im as they was hirritated at he ad whitekid gloves on is ands and he pointed out the animiles to me and sayskeeper these wolves seem upset at somethingmaybe its you says i for i did not like the airs as he giveisself he didnt git angry as i oped he would but he smiled a kindof insolent smile with a mouth full of white sharp teeth oh no theywouldnt like me e saysow yes they would says i aimitatin of him they always likes abone or two to clean their teeth on about teatime which you as abagfulwell it was a odd thing but when the animiles see us atalkin theylay down and when i went over to bersicker he let me stroke his earssame as ever that there man kem over and blessed but if he didnt putin his hand and stroke the old wolfs ears tootyke care says i bersicker is quicknever mind he says im used to emare you in the business yourself i says tyking off my at for aman what trades in wolves anceterer is a good friend to keepersno says he not exactly in the business but i ave made pets ofseveral and with that he lifts his at as perlite as a lord and walksaway old bersicker kep alookin arter im till e was out of sightand then went and lay down in a corner and wouldnt come hout the olehevening well larst night so soon as the moon was hup the wolveshere all began aowling there warnt nothing for them to owl atthere warnt no one near except some one that was evidently acallin adog somewheres out back of the gardings in the park road once or twicei went out to see that all was right and it was and then the owlingstopped just before twelve oclock i just took a look round aforeturnin in an bust me but when i kem opposite to old bersickerscage i see the rails broken and twisted about and the cage empty andthats all i know for certingdid any one else see anythingone of our gardners was acomin ome about that time from a armonywhen he sees a big grey dog comin out through the garding edges atleast so he says but i dont give much for it myself for if he did enever said a word about it to his missis when e got ome and it wasonly after the escape of the wolf was made known and we had been up allnightahuntin of the park for bersicker that he remembered seeinanything my own belief was that the armony ad got into his eadnow mr bilder can you account in any way for the escape of thewolfwell sir he said with a suspicious sort of modesty i think i canbut i dont know as ow youd be satisfied with the theorycertainly i shall if a man like you who knows the animals fromexperience cant hazard a good guess at any rate who is even to trywell then sir i accounts for it this way it seems to me that erewolf escapedsimply because he wanted to get outfrom the hearty way that both thomas and his wife laughed at the joke icould see that it had done service before and that the wholeexplanation was simply an elaborate sell i couldnt cope in badinagewith the worthy thomas but i thought i knew a surer way to his heartso i saidnow mr bilder well consider that first halfsovereign worked offand this brother of his is waiting to be claimed when youve told mewhat you think will happenright yare sir he said briskly yell excoose me i know forachaffin of ye but the old woman here winked at me which was as muchas telling me to go onwell i never said the old ladymy opinion is this that ere wolf is aidin of somewheres thegardner wot didnt remember said he was agallopin northward fasterthan a horse could go but i dont believe him for yer see sirwolves dont gallop no more nor dogs does they not bein built thatway wolves is fine things in a storybook and i dessay when they getsin packs and does be chivyin somethin thats more afeared than they isthey can make a devil of a noise and chop it up whatever it is butlor bless you in real life a wolf is only a low creature not half soclever or bold as a good dog and not half a quarter so much fight inim this one aint been used to fightin or even to providin forhisself and more like hes somewhere round the park aidin anashiverin of and if he thinks at all wonderin where he is to gethis breakfast from or maybe hes got down some area and is in acoalcellar my eye wont some cook get a rum start when she sees hisgreen eyes ashining at her out of the dark if he cant get food hesbound to look for it and mayhap he may chance to light on a butchersshop in time if he doesnt and some nursemaid goes awalkin orf witha soldier leavin of the hinfant in the perambulatorwell then ishouldnt be surprised if the census is one babby the less thatsalli was handing him the halfsovereign when something came bobbing upagainst the window and mr bilders face doubled its natural lengthwith surprisegod bless me he said if there aint old bersicker come back byisselfhe went to the door and opened it a most unnecessary proceeding itseemed to me i have always thought that a wild animal never looks sowell as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us apersonal experience has intensified rather than diminished that ideaafter all however there is nothing like custom for neither bilder norhis wife thought any more of the wolf than i should of a dog the animalitself was as peaceful and wellbehaved as that father of allpicturewolvesred riding hoods quondam friend whilst moving herconfidence in masqueradethe whole scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos thewicked wolf that for half a day had paralysed london and set all thechildren in the town shivering in their shoes was there in a sort ofpenitent mood and was received and petted like a sort of vulpineprodigal son old bilder examined him all over with most tendersolicitude and when he had finished with his penitent saidthere i knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of troubledidnt i say it all along heres his head all cut and full of brokenglass es been agettin over some bloomin wall or other its ashyme that people are allowed to top their walls with broken bottlesthis eres what comes of it come along bersickerhe took the wolf and locked him up in a cage with a piece of meat thatsatisfied in quantity at any rate the elementary conditions of thefatted calf and went off to reporti came off too to report the only exclusive information that is giventoday regarding the strange escapade at the zoodr sewards diary septemberi was engaged after dinner in my study posting up mybooks which through press of other work and the many visits to lucyhad fallen sadly into arrear suddenly the door was burst open and inrushed my patient with his face distorted with passion i wasthunderstruck for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accordinto the superintendents study is almost unknown without an instantspause he made straight at me he had a dinnerknife in his hand andas i saw he was dangerous i tried to keep the table between us he wastoo quick and too strong for me however for before i could get mybalance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severelybefore he could strike again however i got in my right and he wassprawling on his back on the floor my wrist bled freely and quite alittle pool trickled on to the carpet i saw that my friend was notintent on further effort and occupied myself binding up my wristkeeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time when theattendants rushed in and we turned our attention to him his employmentpositively sickened me he was lying on his belly on the floor lickingup like a dog the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist he waseasily secured and to my surprise went with the attendants quiteplacidly simply repeating over and over again the blood is the lifethe blood is the lifei cannot afford to lose blood just at present i have lost too much oflate for my physical good and then the prolonged strain of lucysillness and its horrible phases is telling on me i am overexcited andweary and i need rest rest rest happily van helsing has not summonedme so i need not forego my sleep tonight i could not well do withoutittelegram

visit and see that flowers are asplaced very important do not fail shall be with you as soon aspossible after arrivaldr sewards diary septemberjust off for train to london the arrival of vanhelsings telegram filled me with dismay a whole night lost and i knowby bitter experience what may happen in a night of course it ispossible that all may be well but what may have happened surelythere is some horrible doom hanging over us that every possible accidentshould thwart us in all we try to do i shall take this cylinder withme and then i can complete my entry on lucys phonographmemorandum left by lucy westenra september nighti write this and leave it to be seen so that noone may by any chance get into trouble through me this is an exactrecord of what took place tonight i feel i am dying of weakness andhave barely strength to write but it must be done if i die in thedoingi went to bed as usual taking care that the flowers were placed as drvan helsing directed and soon fell asleepi was waked by the flapping at the window which had begun after thatsleepwalking on the cliff at whitby when mina saved me and which now iknow so well i was not afraid but i did wish that dr seward was inthe next roomas dr van helsing said he would beso that i might havecalled him i tried to go to sleep but could not then there came to methe old fear of sleep and i determined to keep awake perversely sleepwould try to come then when i did not want it so as i feared to bealone i opened my door and called out is there anybody there therewas no answer i was afraid to wake mother and so closed my door againthen outside in the shrubbery i heard a sort of howl like a dogs butmore fierce and deeper i went to the window and looked out but couldsee nothing except a big bat which had evidently been buffeting itswings against the window so i went back to bed again but determinednot to go to sleep presently the door opened and mother looked inseeing by my moving that i was not asleep came in and sat by me shesaid to me even more sweetly and softly than her wonti was uneasy about you darling and came in to see that you were allrighti feared she might catch cold sitting there and asked her to come inand sleep with me so she came into bed and lay down beside me she didnot take off her dressing gown for she said she would only stay a whileand then go back to her own bed as she lay there in my arms and i inhers the flapping and buffeting came to the window again she wasstartled and a little frightened and cried out what is that i triedto pacify her and at last succeeded and she lay quiet but i couldhear her poor dear heart still beating terribly after a while there wasthe low howl again out in the shrubbery and shortly after there was acrash at the window and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floorthe window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in and in theaperture of the broken panes there was the head of a great gaunt greywolf mother cried out in a fright and struggled up into a sittingposture and clutched wildly at anything that would help her amongstother things she clutched the wreath of flowers that dr van helsinginsisted on my wearing round my neck and tore it away from me for asecond or two she sat up pointing at the wolf and there was a strangeand horrible gurgling in her throat then she fell overas if struckwith lightning and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for amoment or two the room and all round seemed to spin round i kept myeyes fixed on the window but the wolf drew his head back and a wholemyriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the brokenwindow and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust thattravellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert i tried tostir but there was some spell upon me and dear mothers poor bodywhich seemed to grow cold alreadyfor her dear heart had ceased tobeatweighed me down and i remembered no more for a whilethe time did not seem long but very very awful till i recoveredconsciousness again somewhere near a passing bell was tolling thedogs all round the neighbourhood were howling and in our shrubberyseemingly just outside a nightingale was singing i was dazed andstupid with pain and terror and weakness but the sound of thenightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfortme the sounds seemed to have awakened the maids too for i could heartheir bare feet pattering outside my door i called to them and theycame in and when they saw what had happened and what it was that layover me on the bed they screamed out the wind rushed in through thebroken window and the door slammed to they lifted off the body of mydear mother and laid her covered up with a sheet on the bed after ihad got up they were all so frightened and nervous that i directed themto go to the diningroom and have each a glass of wine the door flewopen for an instant and closed again the maids shrieked and then wentin a body to the diningroom and i laid what flowers i had on my dearmothers breast when they were there i remembered what dr van helsinghad told me but i didnt like to remove them and besides i wouldhave some of the servants to sit up with me now i was surprised thatthe maids did not come back i called them but got no answer so i wentto the diningroom to look for themmy heart sank when i saw what had happened they all four lay helplesson the floor breathing heavily the decanter of sherry was on the tablehalf full but there was a queer acrid smell about i was suspiciousand examined the decanter it smelt of laudanum and looking on thesideboard i found that the bottle which mothers doctor uses forheroh did usewas empty what am i to do what am i to do i am backin the room with mother i cannot leave her and i am alone save forthe sleeping servants whom some one has drugged alone with the dead idare not go out for i can hear the low howl of the wolf through thebroken windowthe air seems full of specks floating and circling in the draught fromthe window and the lights burn blue and dim what am i to do godshield me from harm this night i shall hide this paper in my breastwhere they shall find it when they come to lay me out my dear mothergone it is time that i go too goodbye dear arthur if i should notsurvive this night god keep you dear and god help me septemberi drove at once to hillingham and arrived earlykeeping my cab at the gate i went up the avenue alone i knocked gentlyand rang as quietly as possible for i feared to disturb lucy or hermother and hoped to only bring a servant to the door after a whilefinding no response i knocked and rang again still no answer i cursedthe laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such anhourfor it was now ten oclockand so rang and knocked again butmore impatiently but still without response hitherto i had blamed onlythe servants but now a terrible fear began to assail me was thisdesolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawingtight around us was it indeed a house of death to which i had come toolate i knew that minutes even seconds of delay might mean hours ofdanger to lucy if she had had again one of those frightful relapsesand i went round the house to try if i could find by chance an entryanywherei could find no means of ingress every window and door was fastened andlocked and i returned baffled to the porch as i did so i heard therapid pitpat of a swiftly driven horses feet they stopped at thegate and a few seconds later i met van helsing running up the avenuewhen he saw me he gasped outthen it was you and just arrived how is she are we too late did younot get my telegrami answered as quickly and coherently as i could that i had only got histelegram early in the morning and had not lost a minute in coming hereand that i could not make any one in the house hear me he paused andraised his hat as he said solemnlythen i fear we are too late gods will be done with his usualrecuperative energy he went on come if there be no way open to getin we must make one time is all in all to us nowwe went round to the back of the house where there was a kitchenwindow the professor took a small surgical saw from his case andhanding it to me pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window iattacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them thenwith a long thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes andopened the window i helped the professor in and followed him therewas no one in the kitchen or in the servants rooms which were close athand we tried all the rooms as we went along and in the diningroomdimly lit by rays of light through the shutters found fourservantwomen lying on the floor there was no need to think them deadfor their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in theroom left no doubt as to their condition van helsing and i looked ateach other and as we moved away he said we can attend to them laterthen we ascended to lucys room for an instant or two we paused at thedoor to listen but there was no sound that we could hear with whitefaces and trembling hands we opened the door gently and entered theroomhow shall i describe what we saw on the bed lay two women lucy and hermother the latter lay farthest in and she was covered with a whitesheet the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through thebroken window showing the drawn white face with a look of terrorfixed upon it by her side lay lucy with face white and still moredrawn the flowers which had been round her neck we found upon hermothers bosom and her throat was bare showing the two little woundswhich we had noticed before but looking horribly white and mangledwithout a word the professor bent over the bed his head almost touchingpoor lucys breast then he gave a quick turn of his head as of one wholistens and leaping to his feet he cried out to meit is not yet too late quick quick bring the brandyi flew downstairs and returned with it taking care to smell and tasteit lest it too were drugged like the decanter of sherry which i foundon the table the maids were still breathing but more restlessly and ifancied that the narcotic was wearing off i did not stay to make surebut returned to van helsing he rubbed the brandy as on anotheroccasion on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of herhands he said to mei can do this all that can be at the present you go wake those maidsflick them in the face with a wet towel and flick them hard make themget heat and fire and a warm bath this poor soul is nearly as cold asthat beside her she will need be heated before we can do anythingmorei went at once and found little difficulty in waking three of thewomen the fourth was only a young girl and the drug had evidentlyaffected her more strongly so i lifted her on the sofa and let hersleep the others were dazed at first but as remembrance came back tothem they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner i was stern withthem however and would not let them talk i told them that one lifewas bad enough to lose and that if they delayed they would sacrificemiss lucy so sobbing and crying they went about their way half cladas they were and prepared fire and water fortunately the kitchen andboiler fires were still alive and there was no lack of hot water wegot a bath and carried lucy out as she was and placed her in it whilstwe were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door oneof the maids ran off hurried on some more clothes and opened it thenshe returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had comewith a message from mr holmwood i bade her simply tell him that hemust wait for we could see no one now she went away with the messageand engrossed with our work i clean forgot all about himi never saw in all my experience the professor work in such deadlyearnest i knewas he knewthat it was a standup fight with deathand in a pause told him so he answered me in a way that i did notunderstand but with the sternest look that his face could wearif that were all i would stop here where we are now and let her fadeaway into peace for i see no light in life over her horizon he wenton with his work with if possible renewed and more frenzied vigourpresently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning tobe of some effect lucys heart beat a trifle more audibly to thestethoscope and her lungs had a perceptible movement van helsingsface almost beamed and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her ina hot sheet to dry her he said to methe first gain is ours check to the kingwe took lucy into another room which had by now been prepared and laidher in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat i noticedthat van helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat she wasstill unconscious and was quite as bad as if not worse than we hadever seen hervan helsing called in one of the women and told her to stay with herand not to take her eyes off her till we returned and then beckoned meout of the roomwe must consult as to what is to be done he said as we descended thestairs in the hall he opened the diningroom door and we passed in heclosing the door carefully behind him the shutters had been opened butthe blinds were already down with that obedience to the etiquette ofdeath which the british woman of the lower classes always rigidlyobserves the room was therefore dimly dark it was however lightenough for our purposes van helsings sternness was somewhat relievedby a look of perplexity he was evidently torturing his mind aboutsomething so i waited for an instant and he spokewhat are we to do now where are we to turn for help we must haveanother transfusion of blood and that soon or that poor girls lifewont be worth an hours purchase you are exhausted already i amexhausted too i fear to trust those women even if they would havecourage to submit what are we to do for some one who will open hisveins for herwhats the matter with me anyhowthe voice came from the sofa across the room and its tones broughtrelief and joy to my heart for they were those of quincey morris vanhelsing started angrily at the first sound but his face softened and aglad look came into his eyes as i cried out quincey morris andrushed towards him with outstretched handswhat brought you here i cried as our hands meti guess art is the causehe handed me a telegramhave not heard from seward for three days and am terribly anxiouscannot leave father still in same condition send me word how lucy isdo not delayholmwoodi think i came just in the nick of time you know you have only to tellme what to dovan helsing strode forward and took his hand looking him straight inthe eyes as he saida brave mans blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is introuble youre a man and no mistake well the devil may work againstus for all hes worth but god sends us men when we want themonce again we went through that ghastly operation i have not the heartto go through with the details lucy had got a terrible shock and ittold on her more than before for though plenty of blood went into herveins her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the otheroccasions her struggle back into life was something frightful to seeand hear however the action of both heart and lungs improved and vanhelsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia as before and withgood effect her faint became a profound slumber the professor watchedwhilst i went downstairs with quincey morris and sent one of the maidsto pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting i left quincey lying downafter having a glass of wine and told the cook to get ready a goodbreakfast then a thought struck me and i went back to the room wherelucy now was when i came softly in i found van helsing with a sheet ortwo of notepaper in his hand he had evidently read it and wasthinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow there was a lookof grim satisfaction in his face as of one who has had a doubt solvedhe handed me the paper saying only it dropped from lucys breast whenwe carried her to the bathwhen i had read it i stood looking at the professor and after a pauseasked him in gods name what does it all mean was she or is shemad or what sort of horrible danger is it i was so bewildered that idid not know what to say more van helsing put out his hand and took thepaper sayingdo not trouble about it now forget it for the present you shall knowand understand it all in good time but it will be later and now whatis it that you came to me to say this brought me back to fact and iwas all myself againi came to speak about the certificate of death if we do not actproperly and wisely there may be an inquest and that paper would haveto be produced i am in hopes that we need have no inquest for if wehad it would surely kill poor lucy if nothing else did i know and youknow and the other doctor who attended her knows that mrs westenrahad disease of the heart and we can certify that she died of it let usfill up the certificate at once and i shall take it myself to theregistrar and go on to the undertakergood oh my friend john well thought of truly miss lucy if she besad in the foes that beset her is at least happy in the friends thatlove her one two three all open their veins for her besides one oldman ah yes i know friend john i am not blind i love you all themore for it now goin the hall i met quincey morris with a telegram for arthur telling himthat mrs westenra was dead that lucy also had been ill but was nowgoing on better and that van helsing and i were with her i told himwhere i was going and he hurried me out but as i was going saidwhen you come back jack may i have two words with you all toourselves i nodded in reply and went out i found no difficulty aboutthe registration and arranged with the local undertaker to come up inthe evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangementswhen i got back quincey was waiting for me i told him i would see himas soon as i knew about lucy and went up to her room she was stillsleeping and the professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at herside from his putting his finger to his lips i gathered that heexpected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling natureso i went down to quincey and took him into the breakfastroom wherethe blinds were not drawn down and which was a little more cheerful orrather less cheerless than the other rooms when we were alone he saidto mejack seward i dont want to shove myself in anywhere where ive noright to be but this is no ordinary case you know i loved that girland wanted to marry her but although thats all past and gone i canthelp feeling anxious about her all the same what is it thats wrongwith her the dutchmanand a fine old fellow he is i can seethatsaid that time you two came into the room that you must haveanother transfusion of blood and that both you and he were exhaustednow i know well that you medical men speak in camera and that a manmust not expect to know what they consult about in private but this isno common matter and whatever it is i have done my part is not thatsothats so i said and he went oni take it that both you and van helsing had done already what i didtoday is not that sothats soand i guess art was in it too when i saw him four days ago down at hisown place he looked queer i have not seen anything pulled down so quicksince i was on the pampas and had a mare that i was fond of go to grassall in a night one of those big bats that they call vampires had got ather in the night and what with his gorge and the vein left open therewasnt enough blood in her to let her stand up and i had to put abullet through her as she lay jack if you may tell me withoutbetraying confidence arthur was the first is not that so as he spokethe poor fellow looked terribly anxious he was in a torture of suspenseregarding the woman he loved and his utter ignorance of the terriblemystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain his veryheart was bleeding and it took all the manhood of himand there was aroyal lot of it tooto keep him from breaking down i paused beforeanswering for i felt that i must not betray anything which theprofessor wished kept secret but already he knew so much and guessedso much that there could be no reason for not answering so i answeredin the same phrase thats soand how long has this been going onabout ten daysten days then i guess jack seward that that poor pretty creaturethat we all love has had put into her veins within that time the bloodof four strong men man alive her whole body wouldnt hold it thencoming close to me he spoke in a fierce halfwhisper what took itouti shook my head that i said is the crux van helsing is simplyfrantic about it and i am at my wits end i cant even hazard a guessthere has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown outall our calculations as to lucy being properly watched but these shallnot occur again here we stay until all be wellor ill quincey heldout his hand count me in he said you and the dutchman will tell mewhat to do and ill do itwhen she woke late in the afternoon lucys first movement was to feelin her breast and to my surprise produced the paper which van helsinghad given me to read the careful professor had replaced it where it hadcome from lest on waking she should be alarmed her eye then lit on vanhelsing and on me too and gladdened then she looked around the roomand seeing where she was shuddered she gave a loud cry and put herpoor thin hands before her pale face we both understood what thatmeantthat she had realised to the full her mothers death so we triedwhat we could to comfort her doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat butshe was very low in thought and spirit and wept silently and weakly fora long time we told her that either or both of us would now remain withher all the time and that seemed to comfort her towards dusk she fellinto a doze here a very odd thing occurred whilst still asleep shetook the paper from her breast and tore it in two van helsing steppedover and took the pieces from her all the same however she went onwith the action of tearing as though the material were still in herhands finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scatteringthe fragments van helsing seemed surprised and his brows gathered asif in thought but he said nothing                                    septemberall last night she slept fitfully being always afraidto sleep and something weaker when she woke from it the professor andi took it in turns to watch and we never left her for a momentunattended quincey morris said nothing about his intention but i knewthat all night long he patrolled round and round the housewhen the day came its searching light showed the ravages in poor lucysstrength she was hardly able to turn her head and the littlenourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good at times sheslept and both van helsing and i noticed the difference in her betweensleeping and waking whilst asleep she looked stronger although morehaggard and her breathing was softer her open mouth showed the palegums drawn back from the teeth which thus looked positively longer andsharper than usual when she woke the softness of her eyes evidentlychanged the expression
