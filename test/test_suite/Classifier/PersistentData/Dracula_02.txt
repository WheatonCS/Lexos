all three laughedsuch asilvery musical laugh but as hard as though the sound never could havecome through the softness of human lips it was like the intolerabletingling sweetness of waterglasses when played on by a cunning handthe fair girl shook her head coquettishly and the other two urged heron one saidgo on you are first and we shall follow yours is the right tobegin the other addedhe is young and strong there are kisses for us all i lay quietlooking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipationthe fair girl advanced and bent over me till i could feel the movementof her breath upon me sweet it was in one sense honeysweet and sentthe same tingling through the nerves as her voice but with a bitterunderlying the sweet a bitter offensiveness as one smells in bloodi was afraid to raise my eyelids but looked out and saw perfectly underthe lashes the girl went on her knees and bent over me simplygloating there was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrillingand repulsive and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lipslike an animal till i could see in the moonlight the moisture shiningon the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharpteeth lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range ofmy mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat then shepaused and i could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it lickedher teeth and lips and could feel the hot breath on my neck then theskin of my throat began to tingle as ones flesh does when the hand thatis to tickle it approaches nearernearer i could feel the softshivering touch of the lips on the supersensitive skin of my throatand the hard dents of two sharp teeth just touching and pausing therei closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waitedwaited with beatingheartbut at that instant another sensation swept through me as quick aslightning i was conscious of the presence of the count and of hisbeing as if lapped in a storm of fury as my eyes opened involuntarily isaw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and withgiants power draw it back the blue eyes transformed with fury thewhite teeth champing with rage and the fair cheeks blazing red withpassion but the count never did i imagine such wrath and fury even tothe demons of the pit his eyes were positively blazing the red lightin them was lurid as if the flames of hellfire blazed behind them hisface was deathly pale and the lines of it were hard like drawn wiresthe thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving barof whitehot metal with a fierce sweep of his arm he hurled the womanfrom him and then motioned to the others as though he were beatingthem back it was the same imperious gesture that i had seen used to thewolves in a voice which though low and almost in a whisper seemed tocut through the air and then ring round the room he saidhow dare you touch him any of you how dare you cast eyes on him wheni had forbidden it back i tell you all this man belongs to me bewarehow you meddle with him or youll have to deal with me the fair girlwith a laugh of ribald coquetry turned to answer himyou yourself never loved you never love on this the other womenjoined and such a mirthless hard soulless laughter rang through theroom that it almost made me faint to hear it seemed like the pleasureof fiends then the count turned after looking at my face attentivelyand said in a soft whisperyes i too can love you yourselves can tell it from the past is itnot so well now i promise you that when i am done with him you shallkiss him at your will now go go i must awaken him for there is workto be doneare we to have nothing tonight said one of them with a low laughas she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor and whichmoved as though there were some living thing within it for answer henodded his head one of the women jumped forward and opened it if myears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail as of ahalfsmothered child the women closed round whilst i was aghast withhorror but as i looked they disappeared and with them the dreadfulbag there was no door near them and they could not have passed mewithout my noticing they simply seemed to fade into the rays of themoonlight and pass out through the window for i could see outside thedim shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded awaythen the horror overcame me and i sank down unconsciousi awoke in my own bed if it be that i had not dreamt the count musthave carried me here i tried to satisfy myself on the subject butcould not arrive at any unquestionable result to be sure there werecertain small evidences such as that my clothes were folded and laid byin a manner which was not my habit my watch was still unwound and i amrigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to bed andmany such details but these things are no proof for they may have beenevidences that my mind was not as usual and from some cause oranother i had certainly been much upset i must watch for proof of onething i am glad if it was that the count carried me here and undressedme he must have been hurried in his task for my pockets are intact iam sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he would nothave brooked he would have taken or destroyed it as i look round thisroom although it has been to me so full of fear it is now a sort ofsanctuary for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women whowerewho arewaiting to suck my blood                                    mayi have been down to look at that room again in daylight fori must know the truth when i got to the doorway at the top of thestairs i found it closed it had been so forcibly driven against thejamb that part of the woodwork was splintered i could see that the boltof the lock had not been shot but the door is fastened from the insidei fear it was no dream and must act on this surmise                                    mayi am surely in the toils last night the count asked me inthe suavest tones to write three letters one saying that my work herewas nearly done and that i should start for home within a few daysanother that i was starting on the next morning from the time of theletter and the third that i had left the castle and arrived atbistritz i would fain have rebelled but felt that in the present stateof things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the count whilst iam so absolutely in his power and to refuse would be to excite hissuspicion and to arouse his anger he knows that i know too much andthat i must not live lest i be dangerous to him my only chance is toprolong my opportunities something may occur which will give me achance to escape i saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrathwhich was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him he explainedto me that posts were few and uncertain and that my writing now wouldensure ease of mind to my friends and he assured me with so muchimpressiveness that he would countermand the later letters which wouldbe held over at bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of myprolonging my stay that to oppose him would have been to create newsuspicion i therefore pretended to fall in with his views and askedhim what dates i should put on the letters he calculated a minute andthen saidthe first should be june  the second june  and the third junei know now the span of my life god help me                                    maythere is a chance of escape or at any rate of being able tosend word home a band of szgany have come to the castle and areencamped in the courtyard these szgany are gipsies i have notes ofthem in my book they are peculiar to this part of the world thoughallied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over there are thousandsof them in hungary and transylvania who are almost outside all lawthey attach themselves as a rule to some great noble or boyar andcall themselves by his name they are fearless and without religionsave superstition and they talk only their own varieties of the romanytonguei shall write some letters home and shall try to get them to have themposted i have already spoken them through my window to beginacquaintanceship they took their hats off and made obeisance and manysigns which however i could not understand any more than i couldtheir spoken language                                   i have written the letters minas is in shorthand and i simply ask mrhawkins to communicate with her to her i have explained my situationbut without the horrors which i may only surmise it would shock andfrighten her to death were i to expose my heart to her should theletters not carry then the count shall not yet know my secret or theextent of my knowledge                                   i have given the letters i threw them through the bars of my windowwith a gold piece and made what signs i could to have them posted theman who took them pressed them to his heart and bowed and then put themin his cap i could do no more i stole back to the study and began toread as the count did not come in i have written here                                   the count has come he sat down beside me and said in his smoothestvoice as he opened two lettersthe szgany has given me these of which though i know not whence theycome i shall of course take care seehe must have looked atitone is from you and to my friend peter hawkins the otherherehe caught sight of the strange symbols as he opened the envelope andthe dark look came into his face and his eyes blazed wickedlytheother is a vile thing an outrage upon friendship and hospitality it isnot signed well so it cannot matter to us and he calmly held letterand envelope in the flame of the lamp till they were consumed then hewent onthe letter to hawkinsthat i shall of course send on since it isyours your letters are sacred to me your pardon my friend thatunknowingly i did break the seal will you not cover it again he heldout the letter to me and with a courteous bow handed me a cleanenvelope i could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence whenhe went out of the room i could hear the key turn softly a minute lateri went over and tried it and the door was lockedwhen an hour or two after the count came quietly into the room hiscoming awakened me for i had gone to sleep on the sofa he was verycourteous and very cheery in his manner and seeing that i had beensleeping he saidso my friend you are tired get to bed there is the surest rest imay not have the pleasure to talk tonight since there are many laboursto me but you will sleep i pray i passed to my room and went to bedand strange to say slept without dreaming despair has its own calms                                    maythis morning when i woke i thought i would provide myselfwith some paper and envelopes from my bag and keep them in my pocket sothat i might write in case i should get an opportunity but again asurprise again a shockevery scrap of paper was gone and with it all my notes my memorandarelating to railways and travel my letter of credit in fact all thatmight be useful to me were i once outside the castle i sat and ponderedawhile and then some thought occurred to me and i made search of myportmanteau and in the wardrobe where i had placed my clothesthe suit in which i had travelled was gone and also my overcoat andrug i could find no trace of them anywhere this looked like some newscheme of villainy                                    junethis morning as i was sitting on the edge of my bedcudgelling my brains i heard without a cracking of whips and poundingand scraping of horses feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyardwith joy i hurried to the window and saw drive into the yard two greatleiterwagons each drawn by eight sturdy horses and at the head ofeach pair a slovak with his wide hat great nailstudded belt dirtysheepskin and high boots they had also their long staves in hand iran to the door intending to descend and try and join them through themain hall as i thought that way might be opened for them again ashock my door was fastened on the outsidethen i ran to the window and cried to them they looked up at mestupidly and pointed but just then the hetman of the szgany came outand seeing them pointing to my window said something at which theylaughed henceforth no effort of mine no piteous cry or agonisedentreaty would make them even look at me they resolutely turned awaythe leiterwagons contained great square boxes with handles of thickrope these were evidently empty by the ease with which the slovakshandled them and by their resonance as they were roughly moved whenthey were all unloaded and packed in a great heap in one corner of theyard the slovaks were given some money by the szgany and spitting onit for luck lazily went each to his horses head shortly afterwards iheard the cracking of their whips die away in the distance                                    june before morninglast night the count left me early andlocked himself into his own room as soon as i dared i ran up thewinding stair and looked out of the window which opened south ithought i would watch for the count for there is something going onthe szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work ofsome kind i know it for now and then i hear a faraway muffled soundas of mattock and spade and whatever it is it must be the end of someruthless villainyi had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour when i sawsomething coming out of the counts window i drew back and watchedcarefully and saw the whole man emerge it was a new shock to me tofind that he had on the suit of clothes which i had worn whilsttravelling here and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which ihad seen the women take away there could be no doubt as to his questand in my garb too this then is his new scheme of evil that he willallow others to see me as they think so that he may both leaveevidence that i have been seen in the towns or villages posting my ownletters and that any wickedness which he may do shall by the localpeople be attributed to meit makes me rage to think that this can go on and whilst i am shut uphere a veritable prisoner but without that protection of the law whichis even a criminals right and consolationi thought i would watch for the counts return and for a long time satdoggedly at the window then i began to notice that there were somequaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight they werelike the tiniest grains of dust and they whirled round and gathered inclusters in a nebulous sort of way i watched them with a sense ofsoothing and a sort of calm stole over me i leaned back in theembrasure in a more comfortable position so that i could enjoy morefully the aërial gambollingsomething made me start up a low piteous howling of dogs somewhere farbelow in the valley which was hidden from my sight louder it seemed toring in my ears and the floating motes of dust to take new shapes tothe sound as they danced in the moonlight i felt myself struggling toawake to some call of my instincts nay my very soul was strugglingand my halfremembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call iwas becoming hypnotised quicker and quicker danced the dust themoonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloombeyond more and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantomshapes and then i started broad awake and in full possession of mysenses and ran screaming from the place the phantom shapes which werebecoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams were those of thethree ghostly women to whom i was doomed i fled and felt somewhatsafer in my own room where there was no moonlight and where the lampwas burning brightlywhen a couple of hours had passed i heard something stirring in thecounts room something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed and thenthere was silence deep awful silence which chilled me with abeating heart i tried the door but i was locked in my prison andcould do nothing i sat down and simply criedas i sat i heard a sound in the courtyard withoutthe agonised cry of awoman i rushed to the window and throwing it up peered out betweenthe bars there indeed was a woman with dishevelled hair holding herhands over her heart as one distressed with running she was leaningagainst a corner of the gateway when she saw my face at the window shethrew herself forward and shouted in a voice laden with menacemonster give me my childshe threw herself on her knees and raising up her hands cried the samewords in tones which wrung my heart then she tore her hair and beat herbreast and abandoned herself to all the violences of extravagantemotion finally she threw herself forward and though i could not seeher i could hear the beating of her naked hands against the doorsomewhere high overhead probably on the tower i heard the voice of thecount calling in his harsh metallic whisper his call seemed to beanswered from far and wide by the howling of wolves before many minuteshad passed a pack of them poured like a pentup dam when liberatedthrough the wide entrance into the courtyardthere was no cry from the woman and the howling of the wolves was butshort before long they streamed away singly licking their lipsi could not pity her for i knew now what had become of her child andshe was better deadwhat shall i do what can i do how can i escape from this dreadfulthing of night and gloom and fear                                    june morningno man knows till he has suffered from the nighthow sweet and how dear to his heart and eye the morning can be when thesun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the greatgateway opposite my window the high spot which it touched seemed to meas if the dove from the ark had lighted there my fear fell from me asif it had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth i musttake action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me lastnight one of my postdated letters went to post the first of that fatalseries which is to blot out the very traces of my existence from theearthlet me not think of it actionit has always been at nighttime that i have been molested orthreatened or in some way in danger or in fear i have not yet seen thecount in the daylight can it be that he sleeps when others wake thathe may be awake whilst they sleep if i could only get into his roombut there is no possible way the door is always locked no way for meyes there is a way if one dares to take it where his body has gonewhy may not another body go i have seen him myself crawl from hiswindow why should not i imitate him and go in by his window thechances are desperate but my need is more desperate still i shall riskit at the worst it can only be death and a mans death is not acalfs and the dreaded hereafter may still be open to me god help mein my task goodbye mina if i fail goodbye my faithful friend andsecond father goodbye all and last of all mina                                   same day lateri have made the effort and god helping me havecome safely back to this room i must put down every detail in order iwent whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the southside and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runsaround the building on this side the stones are big and roughly cutand the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them itook off my boots and ventured out on the desperate way i looked downonce so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth wouldnot overcome me but after that kept my eyes away from it i knew prettywell the direction and distance of the counts window and made for itas well as i could having regard to the opportunities available i didnot feel dizzyi suppose i was too excitedand the time seemedridiculously short till i found myself standing on the windowsill andtrying to raise up the sash i was filled with agitation however wheni bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window then i lookedaround for the count but with surprise and gladness made a discoverythe room was empty it was barely furnished with odd things whichseemed to have never been used the furniture was something the samestyle as that in the south rooms and was covered with dust i lookedfor the key but it was not in the lock and i could not find itanywhere the only thing i found was a great heap of gold in onecornergold of all kinds roman and british and austrian andhungarian and greek and turkish money covered with a film of dust asthough it had lain long in the ground none of it that i noticed wasless than three hundred years old there were also chains and ornamentssome jewelled but all of them old and stainedat one corner of the room was a heavy door i tried it for since icould not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door whichwas the main object of my search i must make further examination orall my efforts would be in vain it was open and led through a stonepassage to a circular stairway which went steeply down i descendedminding carefully where i went for the stairs were dark being only litby loopholes in the heavy masonry at the bottom there was a darktunnellike passage through which came a deathly sickly odour theodour of old earth newly turned as i went through the passage the smellgrew closer and heavier at last i pulled open a heavy door which stoodajar and found myself in an old ruined chapel which had evidentlybeen used as a graveyard the roof was broken and in two places weresteps leading to vaults but the ground had recently been dug over andthe earth placed in great wooden boxes manifestly those which had beenbrought by the slovaks there was nobody about and i made search forany further outlet but there was none then i went over every inch ofthe ground so as not to lose a chance i went down even into thevaults where the dim light struggled although to do so was a dread tomy very soul into two of these i went but saw nothing except fragmentsof old coffins and piles of dust in the third however i made adiscoverythere in one of the great boxes of which there were fifty in all on apile of newly dug earth lay the count he was either dead or asleep icould not say whichfor the eyes were open and stony but without theglassiness of deathand the cheeks had the warmth of life through alltheir pallor the lips were as red as ever but there was no sign ofmovement no pulse no breath no beating of the heart i bent over himand tried to find any sign of life but in vain he could not have lainthere long for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few hoursby the side of the box was its cover pierced with holes here and therei thought he might have the keys on him but when i went to search i sawthe dead eyes and in them dead though they were such a look of hatethough unconscious of me or my presence that i fled from the place andleaving the counts room by the window crawled again up the castlewall regaining my room i threw myself panting upon the bed and triedto think                                    junetoday is the date of my last letter and the count hastaken steps to prove that it was genuine for again i saw him leave thecastle by the same window and in my clothes as he went down the walllizard fashion i wished i had a gun or some lethal weapon that i mightdestroy him but i fear that no weapon wrought alone by mans hand wouldhave any effect on him i dared not wait to see him return for i fearedto see those weird sisters i came back to the library and read theretill i fell asleepi was awakened by the count who looked at me as grimly as a man canlook as he saidtomorrow my friend we must part you return to your beautifulengland i to some work which may have such an end that we may nevermeet your letter home has been despatched tomorrow i shall not behere but all shall be ready for your journey in the morning come theszgany who have some labours of their own here and also come someslovaks when they have gone my carriage shall come for you and shallbear you to the borgo pass to meet the diligence from bukovina tobistritz but i am in hopes that i shall see more of you at castledracula i suspected him and determined to test his sinceritysincerity it seems like a profanation of the word to write it inconnection with such a monster so asked him pointblankwhy may i not go tonightbecause dear sir my coachman and horses are away on a missionbut i would walk with pleasure i want to get away at once he smiledsuch a soft smooth diabolical smile that i knew there was some trickbehind his smoothness he saidand your baggagei do not care about it i can send for it some other timethe count stood up and said with a sweet courtesy which made me rub myeyes it seemed so realyou english have a saying which is close to my heart for its spirit isthat which rules our boyars welcome the coming speed the partingguest come with me my dear young friend not an hour shall you waitin my house against your will though sad am i at your going and thatyou so suddenly desire it come with a stately gravity he with thelamp preceded me down the stairs and along the hall suddenly hestoppedharkclose at hand came the howling of many wolves it was almost as if thesound sprang up at the rising of his hand just as the music of a greatorchestra seems to leap under the bâton of the conductor after a pauseof a moment he proceeded in his stately way to the door drew backthe ponderous bolts unhooked the heavy chains and began to draw itopento my intense astonishment i saw that it was unlocked suspiciously ilooked all round but could see no key of any kindas the door began to open the howling of the wolves without grew louderand angrier their red jaws with champing teeth and their bluntclawedfeet as they leaped came in through the opening door i knew then thatto struggle at the moment against the count was useless with suchallies as these at his command i could do nothing but still the doorcontinued slowly to open and only the counts body stood in the gapsuddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of mydoom i was to be given to the wolves and at my own instigation therewas a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the count andas a last chance i cried outshut the door i shall wait till morning and covered my face with myhands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment with one sweep of hispowerful arm the count threw the door shut and the great bolts clangedand echoed through the hall as they shot back into their placesin silence we returned to the library and after a minute or two i wentto my own room the last i saw of count dracula was his kissing his handto me with a red light of triumph in his eyes and with a smile thatjudas in hell might be proud ofwhen i was in my room and about to lie down i thought i heard awhispering at my door i went to it softly and listened unless my earsdeceived me i heard the voice of the countback back to your own place your time is not yet come wait havepatience tonight is mine tomorrow night is yours there was a lowsweet ripple of laughter and in a rage i threw open the door and sawwithout the three terrible women licking their lips as i appeared theyall joined in a horrible laugh and ran awayi came back to my room and threw myself on my knees it is then so nearthe end tomorrow tomorrow lord help me and those to whom i amdear                                    june morningthese may be the last words i ever write in thisdiary i slept till just before the dawn and when i woke threw myselfon my knees for i determined that if death came he should find mereadyat last i felt that subtle change in the air and knew that the morninghad come then came the welcome cockcrow and i felt that i was safewith a glad heart i opened my door and ran down to the hall i had seenthat the door was unlocked and now escape was before me with handsthat trembled with eagerness i unhooked the chains and drew back themassive boltsbut the door would not move despair seized me i pulled and pulled atthe door and shook it till massive as it was it rattled in itscasement i could see the bolt shot it had been locked after i left thecountthen a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk and idetermined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the countsroom he might kill me but death now seemed the happier choice ofevils without a pause i rushed up to the east window and scrambleddown the wall as before into the counts room it was empty but thatwas as i expected i could not see a key anywhere but the heap of goldremained i went through the door in the corner and down the windingstair and along the dark passage to the old chapel i knew now wellenough where to find the monster i soughtthe great box was in the same place close against the wall but the lidwas laid on it not fastened down but with the nails ready in theirplaces to be hammered home i knew i must reach the body for the key soi raised the lid and laid it back against the wall and then i sawsomething which filled my very soul with horror there lay the countbut looking as if his youth had been half renewed for the white hairand moustache were changed to dark irongrey the cheeks were fullerand the white skin seemed rubyred underneath the mouth was redder thanever for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood which trickled from thecorners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck even the deepburning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh for the lids and pouchesunderneath were bloated it seemed as if the whole awful creature weresimply gorged with blood he lay like a filthy leech exhausted with hisrepletion i shuddered as i bent over to touch him and every sense inme revolted at the contact but i had to search or i was lost thecoming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to thosehorrid three i felt all over the body but no sign could i find of thekey then i stopped and looked at the count there was a mocking smileon the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad this was the being iwas helping to transfer to london where perhaps for centuries to comehe might amongst its teeming millions satiate his lust for blood andcreate a new and everwidening circle of semidemons to batten on thehelpless the very thought drove me mad a terrible desire came upon meto rid the world of such a monster there was no lethal weapon at handbut i seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill thecases and lifting it high struck with the edge downward at thehateful face but as i did so the head turned and the eyes fell fullupon me with all their blaze of basilisk horror the sight seemed toparalyse me and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the facemerely making a deep gash above the forehead the shovel fell from myhand across the box and as i pulled it away the flange of the bladecaught the edge of the lid which fell over again and hid the horridthing from my sight the last glimpse i had was of the bloated facebloodstained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held itsown in the nethermost helli thought and thought what should be my next move but my brain seemedon fire and i waited with a despairing feeling growing over me as iwaited i heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices comingcloser and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and thecracking of whips the szgany and the slovaks of whom the count hadspoken were coming with a last look around and at the box whichcontained the vile body i ran from the place and gained the countsroom determined to rush out at the moment the door should be openedwith strained ears i listened and heard downstairs the grinding of thekey in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door there musthave been some other means of entry or some one had a key for one ofthe locked doors then there came the sound of many feet tramping anddying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo i turned torun down again towards the vault where i might find the new entrancebut at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind and thedoor to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust fromthe lintels flying when i ran to push it open i found that it washopelessly fast i was again a prisoner and the net of doom was closinground me more closelyas i write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feetand the crash of weights being set down heavily doubtless the boxeswith their freight of earth there is a sound of hammering it is thebox being nailed down now i can hear the heavy feet tramping againalong the hall with many other idle feet coming behind themthe door is shut and the chains rattle there is a grinding of the keyin the lock i can hear the key withdraw then another door opens andshuts i hear the creaking of lock and bolthark in the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheelsthe crack of whips and the chorus of the szgany as they pass into thedistancei am alone in the castle with those awful women faugh mina is a womanand there is nought in common they are devils of the piti shall not remain alone with them i shall try to scale the castle wallfarther than i have yet attempted i shall take some of the gold withme lest i want it later i may find a way from this dreadful placeand then away for home away to the quickest and nearest train awayfrom this cursed spot from this cursed land where the devil and hischildren still walk with earthly feetat least gods mercy is better than that of these monsters and theprecipice is steep and high at its foot a man may sleepas a

and he has an immense lunatic asylum all underhis own care mr holmwood introduced him to me and he called here tosee us and often comes now i think he is one of the most resolute meni ever saw and yet the most calm he seems absolutely imperturbable ican fancy what a wonderful power he must have over his patients he hasa curious habit of looking one straight in the face as if trying toread ones thoughts he tries this on very much with me but i flattermyself he has got a tough nut to crack i know that from my glass doyou ever try to read your own face i do and i can tell you it is nota bad study and gives you more trouble than you can well fancy if youhave never tried it he says that i afford him a curious psychologicalstudy and i humbly think i do i do not as you know take

day isnt it awful i feel sorryreally and truly sorry for two of the poor fellows oh mina i am sohappy that i dont know what to do with myself and three proposalsbut for goodness sake dont tell any of the girls or they would begetting all sorts of extravagant ideas and imagining themselves injuredand slighted if in their very first day at home they did not get six atleast some girls are so vain you and i mina dear who are engaged andare going to settle down soon soberly into old married women candespise vanity well i must tell you about the three but you must keepit a secret dear from every one except of course jonathan youwill tell him because i would if i were in your place certainly tellarthur a woman ought to tell her husband everythingdont you thinkso dearand i must be fair men like women certainly their wives tobe quite as fair as they are and women i am afraid are not alwaysquite as fair as they should be well my dear number one came justbefore lunch i told you of him dr john seward the lunaticasylumman with the strong jaw and the good forehead he was very cooloutwardly but was nervous all the same he had evidently been schoolinghimself as to all sorts of little things and remembered them but healmost managed to sit down on his silk hat which men dont generally dowhen they are cool and then when he wanted to appear at ease he keptplaying with a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream he spoke tome mina very straightforwardly he told me how dear i was to himthough he had known me so little and what his life would be with me tohelp and cheer him he was going to tell me how unhappy he would be if idid not care for him but when he saw me cry he said that he was a bruteand would not add to my present trouble then he broke off and asked ifi could love him in time and when i shook my head his hands trembledand then with some hesitation he asked me if i cared already for any oneelse he put it very nicely saying that he did not want to wring myconfidence from me but only to know because if a womans heart wasfree a man might have hope and then mina i felt a sort of duty totell him that there was some one i only told him that much and then hestood up and he looked very strong and very grave as he took both myhands in his and said he hoped i would be happy and that if i everwanted a friend i must count him one of my best oh mina dear i canthelp crying and you must excuse this letter being all blotted beingproposed to is all very nice and all that sort of thing but it isnt atall a happy thing when you have to see a poor fellow whom you knowloves you honestly going away and looking all brokenhearted and toknow that no matter what he may say at the moment you are passingquite out of his life my dear i must stop here at present i feel somiserable though i am so happyeveningarthur has just gone and i feel in better spirits than when i leftoff so i can go on telling you about the day well my dear number twocame after lunch he is such a nice fellow an american from texas andhe looks so young and so fresh that it seems almost impossible that hehas been to so many places and has had such adventures i sympathisewith poor desdemona when she had such a dangerous stream poured in herear even by a black man i suppose that we women are such cowards thatwe think a man will save us from fears and we marry him i know nowwhat i would do if i were a man and wanted to make a girl love me no idont for there was mr morris telling us his stories and arthur nevertold any and yet my dear i am somewhat previous mr quincey pmorris found me alone it seems that a man always does find a girlalone no he doesnt for arthur tried twice to make a chance and ihelping him all i could i am not ashamed to say it now i must tell youbeforehand that mr morris doesnt always speak slangthat is to sayhe never does so to strangers or before them for he is really welleducated and has exquisite mannersbut he found out that it amused meto hear him talk american slang and whenever i was present and therewas no one to be shocked he said such funny things i am afraid mydear he has to invent it all for it fits exactly into whatever else hehas to say but this is a way slang has i do not know myself if i shallever speak slang i do not know if arthur likes it as i have neverheard him use any as yet well mr morris sat down beside me and lookedas happy and jolly as he could but i could see all the same that he wasvery nervous he took my hand in his and said ever so sweetlymiss lucy i know i aint good enough to regulate the fixins of yourlittle shoes but i guess if you wait till you find a man that is youwill go join them seven young women with the lamps when you quit wontyou just hitch up alongside of me and let us go down the long roadtogether driving in double harnesswell he did look so goodhumoured and so jolly that it didnt seemhalf so hard to refuse him as it did poor dr seward so i said aslightly as i could that i did not know anything of hitching and that iwasnt broken to harness at all yet then he said that he had spoken ina light manner and he hoped that if he had made a mistake in doing soon so grave so momentous an occasion for him i would forgive him hereally did look serious when he was saying it and i couldnt helpfeeling a bit serious tooi know mina you will think me a horridflirtthough i couldnt help feeling a sort of exultation that he wasnumber two in one day and then my dear before i could say a word hebegan pouring out a perfect torrent of lovemaking laying his veryheart and soul at my feet he looked so earnest over it that i shallnever again think that a man must be playful always and never earnestbecause he is merry at times i suppose he saw something in my facewhich checked him for he suddenly stopped and said with a sort ofmanly fervour that i could have loved him for if i had been freelucy you are an honesthearted girl i know i should not be herespeaking to you as i am now if i did not believe you clean grit rightthrough to the very depths of your soul tell me like one good fellowto another is there any one else that you care for and if there isill never trouble you a hairs breadth again but will be if you willlet me a very faithful friendmy dear mina why are men so noble when we women are so little worthyof them here was i almost making fun of this greathearted truegentleman i burst into tearsi am afraid my dear you will thinkthis a very sloppy letter in more ways than oneand i really felt verybadly why cant they let a girl marry three men or as many as wanther and save all this trouble but this is heresy and i must not sayit i am glad to say that though i was crying i was able to look intomr morriss brave eyes and i told him out straightyes there is some one i love though he has not told me yet that heeven loves me i was right to speak to him so frankly for quite alight came into his face and he put out both his hands and took mineithink i put them into hisand said in a hearty waythats my brave girl its better worth being late for a chance ofwinning you than being in time for any other girl in the world dontcry my dear if its for me im a hard nut to crack and i take itstanding up if that other fellow doesnt know his happiness well hedbetter look for it soon or hell have to deal with me little girlyour honesty and pluck have made me a friend and thats rarer than alover its more unselfish anyhow my dear im going to have a prettylonely walk between this and kingdom come wont you give me one kissitll be something to keep off the darkness now and then you can youknow if you like for that other good fellowhe must be a good fellowmy dear and a fine fellow or you could not love himhasnt spokenyet that quite won me mina for it was brave and sweet of him andnoble too to a rivalwasnt itand he so sad so i leant over andkissed him he stood up with my two hands in his and as he looked downinto my facei am afraid i was blushing very muchhe saidlittle girl i hold your hand and youve kissed me and if thesethings dont make us friends nothing ever will thank you for your sweethonesty to me and goodbye he wrung my hand and taking up his hatwent straight out of the room without looking back without a tear or aquiver or a pause and i am crying like a baby oh why must a man likethat be made unhappy when there are lots of girls about who wouldworship the very ground he trod on i know i would if i were freeonlyi dont want to be free my dear this quite upset me and i feel icannot write of happiness just at once after telling you of it and idont wish to tell of the number three until it can be all happyever your lovinglucypsoh about number threei neednt tell you of number three needi besides it was all so confused it seemed only a moment from hiscoming into the room till both his arms were round me and he waskissing me i am very very happy and i dont know what i have done todeserve it i must only try in the future to show that i am notungrateful to god for all his goodness to me in sending to me such alover such a husband and such a friendgoodbyedr sewards diarykept in phonograph mayebb tide in appetite today cannot eat cannot

looking sweeter andlovelier than ever and we drove up to the house at the crescent inwhich they have rooms this is a lovely place the little river theesk runs through a deep valley which broadens out as it comes near theharbour a great viaduct runs across with high piers through which theview seems somehow further away than it really is the valley isbeautifully green and it is so steep that when you are on the high landon either side you look right across it unless you are near enough tosee down the houses of the old townthe side away from usare allredroofed and seem piled up one over the other anyhow like thepictures we see of nuremberg right over the town is the ruin of whitbyabbey which was sacked by the danes and which is the scene of part ofmarmion where the girl was built up in the wall it is a most nobleruin of immense size and full of beautiful and romantic bits there isa legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows between it andthe town there is another church the parish one round which is a biggraveyard all full of tombstones this is to my mind the nicest spot inwhitby for it lies right over the town and has a full view of theharbour and all up the bay to where the headland called kettlenessstretches out into the sea it descends so steeply over the harbour thatpart of the bank has fallen away and some of the graves have beendestroyed in one place part of the stonework of the graves stretchesout over the sandy pathway far below there are walks with seats besidethem through the churchyard and people go and sit there all day longlooking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze i shall come andsit here very often myself and work indeed i am writing now with mybook on my knee and listening to the talk of three old men who aresitting beside me they seem to do nothing all day but sit up here andtalkthe harbour lies below me with on the far side one long granite wallstretching out into the sea with a curve outwards at the end of it inthe middle of which is a lighthouse a heavy seawall runs along outsideof it on the near side the seawall makes an elbow crooked inverselyand its end too has a lighthouse between the two piers there is anarrow opening into the harbour which then suddenly widensit is nice at high water but when the tide is out it shoals away tonothing and there is merely the stream of the esk running betweenbanks of sand with rocks here and there outside the harbour on thisside there rises for about half a mile a great reef the sharp edge ofwhich runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse at the end ofit is a buoy with a bell which swings in bad weather and sends in amournful sound on the wind they have a legend here that when a ship islost bells are heard out at sea i must ask the old man about this heis coming this wayhe is a funny old man he must be awfully old for his face is allgnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree he tells me that he isnearly a hundred and that he was a sailor in the greenland fishingfleet when waterloo was fought he is i am afraid a very scepticalperson for when i asked him about the bells at sea and the white ladyat the abbey he said very brusquelyi wouldnt fash masel about them miss them things be all wore outmind i dont say that they never was but i do say that they wasnt inmy time they be all very well for comers and trippers an the likebut not for a nice young lady like you them feetfolks from york andleeds that be always eatin cured herrins an drinkin tea an lookinout to buy cheap jet would creed aught i wonder masel whod bebothered tellin lies to themeven the newspapers which is full offooltalk i thought he would be a good person to learn interestingthings from so i asked him if he would mind telling me something aboutthe whalefishing in the old days he was just settling himself to beginwhen the clock struck six whereupon he laboured to get up and saidi must gang ageeanwards home now miss my granddaughter doesnt liketo be kept waitin

could downthe steps the steps are a great feature on the place they lead fromthe town up to the church there are hundreds of themi do not know howmanyand they wind up in a delicate curve the slope is so gentle thata horse could easily walk up and down them i think they must originallyhave had something to do with the abbey i shall go home too lucy wentout visiting with her mother and as they were only duty calls i didnot go they will be home by this                                    augusti came up here an hour ago with lucy and we had a mostinteresting talk with my old friend and the two others who always comeand join him he is evidently the sir oracle of them and i should thinkmust have been in his time a most dictatorial person he will not admitanything and downfaces everybody if he cant outargue them he bulliesthem and then takes their silence for agreement with his views lucywas looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock she has got abeautiful colour since she has been here i noticed that the old men didnot lose any time in coming up and sitting near her when we sat downshe is so sweet with old people i think they all fell in love with heron the spot even my old man succumbed and did not contradict her butgave me double share instead i got him on the subject of the legendsand he went off at once into a sort of sermon i must try to remember itand put it downit be

sat awhile and it was all so beautiful before us that wetook hands as we sat and she told me all over again about arthur andtheir coming marriage that made me just a little heartsick for ihavent heard from jonathan for a whole month                                   the same day i came up here alone for i am very sad there was noletter for me i hope there cannot be anything the matter with

the valley to myleft the view is cut off by a black line of roof of the old house nextthe abbey the sheep and lambs are bleating in the fields away behindme and there is a clatter of a donkeys hoofs up the paved road belowthe band on the pier is playing a harsh waltz in good time and furtheralong the quay there is a salvation army meeting in a back streetneither of the bands hears the other but up here i hear and see themboth i wonder where jonathan is and if he is thinking of me i wish hewere heredr sewards diary junethe case of renfield grows more interesting the more i get tounderstand the man he has certain qualities very largely developedselfishness secrecy and purpose i wish i could get at what is theobject of the latter he seems to have some settled scheme of his ownbut what it is i do not yet know his redeeming quality is a love ofanimals though indeed he has such curious turns in it that isometimes imagine he is only abnormally cruel his pets are of oddsorts just now his hobby is catching flies he has at present such aquantity that i have had myself to expostulate to my astonishment hedid not break out into a fury as i expected but took the matter insimple seriousness he thought for a moment and then said may i havethree days i shall clear them away of course i said that would do imust watch him                                    junehe has turned his mind now to spiders and has got severalvery big fellows in a box he keeps feeding them with his flies andthe number of the latter is becoming sensibly diminished although hehas used half his food in attracting more flies from outside to hisroom                                    julyhis spiders are now becoming as great a nuisance as hisflies and today i told him that he must get rid of them he lookedvery sad at this so i said that he must clear out some of them at allevents he cheerfully acquiesced in this and i gave him the same timeas before for reduction he disgusted me much while with him for when ahorrid blowfly bloated with some carrion food buzzed into the roomhe caught it held it exultantly for a few moments between his fingerand thumb and before i knew what he was going to do put it in hismouth and ate it i scolded him for it but he argued quietly that itwas very good and very wholesome that it was life strong life andgave life to him this gave me an idea or the rudiment of one i mustwatch how he gets rid of his spiders he has evidently some deep problemin his mind for he keeps a little notebook in which he is alwaysjotting down something whole pages of it are filled with masses offigures generally single numbers added up in batches and then thetotals added in batches again as though he were focussing someaccount as the auditors put it                                    julythere is a method in his madness and the rudimentary idea inmy mind is growing it will be a whole idea soon and then ohunconscious cerebration you will have to give the wall to yourconscious brother i kept away from my friend for a few days so that imight notice if there were any change things remain as they were exceptthat he has parted with some of his pets and got a new one he hasmanaged to get a sparrow and has already partially tamed it his meansof taming is simple for already the spiders have diminished those thatdo remain however are well fed for he still brings in the flies bytempting them with his food                                    julywe are progressing my friend has now a whole colony ofsparrows and his flies and spiders are almost obliterated when i camein he ran to me and said he wanted to ask me a great favoura veryvery great favour and as he spoke he fawned on me like a dog i askedhim what it was and he said with a sort of rapture in his voice andbearinga kitten a nice little sleek playful kitten that i can play withand teach and feedand feedand feed i was not unprepared for thisrequest for i had noticed how his pets went on increasing in size andvivacity but i did not care that his pretty family of tame sparrowsshould be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and the spiders soi said i would see about it and asked him if he would not rather have acat than a kitten his eagerness betrayed him as he answeredoh yes i would like a cat i only asked for a kitten lest you shouldrefuse me a cat no one would refuse me a kitten would they i shookmy head and said that at present i feared it would not be possible butthat i would see about it his face fell and i could see a warning ofdanger in it for there was a sudden fierce sidelong look which meantkilling the man is an undeveloped homicidal maniac i shall test himwith his present craving and see how it will work out then i shall knowmore                                    p mi have visited him again and found him sitting in a cornerbrooding when i came in he threw himself on his knees before me andimplored me to let him have a cat that his salvation depended upon iti was firm however and told him that he could not have it whereuponhe went without a word and sat down gnawing his fingers in the cornerwhere i had found him i shall see him in the morning early                                    julyvisited renfield very early before the attendant went hisrounds found him up and humming a tune he was spreading out his sugarwhich he had saved in the window and was manifestly beginning hisflycatching again and beginning it cheerfully and with a good grace ilooked around for his birds and not seeing them asked him where theywere he replied without turning round that they had all flown awaythere were a few feathers about the room and on his pillow a drop ofblood i said nothing but went and told the keeper to report to me ifthere were anything odd about him during the day                                    a mthe attendant has just been to me to say that renfield hasbeen very sick and has disgorged a whole lot of feathers my belief isdoctor he said that he has eaten his birds and that he just tookand ate them raw                                    p mi gave renfield a strong opiate tonight enough to makeeven him sleep and took away his pocketbook to look at it the thoughtthat has been buzzing about my brain lately is complete and the theoryproved my homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind i shall have toinvent a new classification for him and call him a zoöphagouslifeeating maniac what he desires is to absorb as many lives as hecan and he has laid himself out to achieve it in a cumulative way hegave many flies to one spider and many spiders to one bird and thenwanted a cat to eat the many birds what would have been his latersteps it would almost be worth while to complete the experiment itmight be done if there were only a sufficient cause men sneered atvivisection and yet look at its results today why not advance sciencein its most difficult and vital aspectthe knowledge of the brain hadi even the secret of one such minddid i hold the key to the fancy ofeven one lunatici might advance my own branch of science to a pitchcompared with which burdonsandersons physiology or ferriersbrainknowledge would be as nothing if only there were a sufficientcause i must not think too much of this or i may be tempted a goodcause might turn the scale with me for may not i too be of anexceptional brain congenitallyhow well the man reasoned lunatics always do within their own scope iwonder at how many lives he values a man or if at only one he hasclosed the account most accurately and today begun a new record howmany of us begin a new record with each day of our livesto me it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended with my new hopeand that truly i began a new record so it will be until the greatrecorder sums me up and closes my ledger account with a balance toprofit or loss oh lucy lucy i cannot be angry with you nor can i beangry with my friend whose happiness is yours but i must only wait onhopeless and work work workif

over the place poor dear she isnaturally anxious about lucy and she tells me that her husband lucysfather had the same habit that he would get up in the night and dresshimself and go out if he were

do wish that he would write ifit were only a single line lucy walks more than ever and each night iam awakened by her moving about the room fortunately the weather is sohot that she cannot get cold but still the anxiety and the perpetuallybeing wakened is beginning to tell on me and i am getting nervous andwakeful myself thank god lucys health keeps up mr holmwood has beensuddenly called to ring to see his father who has been taken seriouslyill lucy frets at the postponement of seeing him but it does not touchher looks she is a trifle stouter and her cheeks are a lovelyrosepink she has lost

is not ill hesurely would have written i look at that last letter of his butsomehow it does not satisfy me it does not read like him and yet it ishis writing there is no mistake of that lucy has not walked much inher sleep the last week but there is an odd concentration about herwhich i do not understand even in her sleep she seems to be watchingme she tries the door and finding it locked goes about the roomsearching for the key augustanother three days and no news this suspense is gettingdreadful if i only knew where to write to or where to go to i shouldfeel easier but no one has heard a
