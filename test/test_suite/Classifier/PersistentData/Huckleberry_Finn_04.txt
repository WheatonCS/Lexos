to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of meanfolks but if we minded our business and didnt talk back and aggravatethem we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the bigclear river which was the free states and wouldnt have no moretroubleit had clouded up pretty dark just after i got on to the raft but itwas clearing up again nowoh well thats all interpreted well enough as far as it goes jim isays but what does these things stand forit was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar  youcould see them firstrate nowjim looked at the trash and then looked at me and back at the trashagain  he had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that hecouldnt seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its placeagain right away  but when he did get the thing straightened around helooked at me steady without ever smiling and sayswhat do dey stan for  ise gwyne to tell you  when i got all woreout wid work en wid de callin for you en went to sleep my heart wuzmos broke bekase you wuz los en i didn kyer no mo what becomeer me en de raf  en when i wake up en fine you back agin all safeen soun de tears come en i could a got down on my knees en kiss yofoot is so thankful en all you wuz thinkin bout wuz how you couldmake a fool uv ole jim wid a lie  dat truck dah is trash en trashis what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey frens en makes emashamedthen he got up slow and walked to the wigwam and went in there withoutsaying anything but that  but that was enough  it made me feel so meani could almost kissed his foot to get him to take it backit was fifteen minutes before i could work myself up to go and humblemyself to a nigger but i done it and i warnt ever sorry for itafterwards neither  i didnt do him no more mean tricks and iwouldnt done that one if id a knowed it would make him feel that waywe slept most all day and started out at night a little ways behind amonstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession  she hadfour long sweeps at each end so we judged she carried as many as thirtymen likely  she had five big wigwams aboard wide apart and an opencamp fire in the middle and a tall flagpole at each end  there was apower of style about her  it amounted to something being a raftsmanon such a craft as thatwe went drifting down into a big bend and the night clouded up and gothot  the river was very wide and was walled with solid timber onboth sides you couldnt see a break in it hardly ever or a light  wetalked about cairo and wondered whether we would know it when we got toit  i said likely we wouldnt because i had heard say there warnt butabout a dozen houses there and if they didnt happen to have them litup how was we going to know we was passing a town  jim said if the twobig rivers joined together there that would show  but i said maybewe might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into thesame old river again that disturbed jimand me too  so the questionwas what to do  i said paddle ashore the first time a light showedand tell them pap was behind coming along with a tradingscow andwas a green hand at the business and wanted to know how far it was tocairo  jim thought it was a good idea so we took a smoke on it andwaitedthere warnt nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town andnot pass it without seeing it  he said hed be mighty sure to see itbecause hed be a free man the minute he seen it but if he missed ithed be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom  everylittle while he jumps up and saysdah she isbut it warnt  it was jackolanterns or lightning bugs so he setdown again and went to watching same as before  jim said it made himall over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom  well i cantell you it made me all over trembly and feverish too to hear himbecause i begun to get it through my head that he was most freeandwho was to blame for it  why me  i couldnt get that out of myconscience no how nor no way it got to troubling me so i couldntrest i couldnt stay still in one place  it hadnt ever come home tome before what this thing was that i was doing  but now it did and itstayed with me and scorched me more and more  i tried to make out tomyself that i warnt to blame because i didnt run jim off from hisrightful owner but it warnt no use conscience up and says everytime but you knowed he was running for his freedom and you could apaddled ashore and told somebody  that was soi couldnt get aroundthat noway  that was where it pinched  conscience says to me whathad poor miss watson done to you that you could see her nigger go offright under your eyes and never say one single word  what did that poorold woman do to you that you could treat her so mean  why she tried tolearn you your book she tried to learn you your manners she tried tobe good to you every way she knowed how  thats what she donei got to feeling so mean and so miserable i most wished i was dead  ifidgeted up and down the raft abusing myself to myself and jim wasfidgeting up and down past me  we neither of us could keep still every time he danced around and says dahs cairo it went through melike a shot and i thought if it was cairo i reckoned i would die ofmiserablenessjim talked out loud all the time while i was talking to myself  he wassaying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free state hewould go to saving up money and never spend a single cent and when hegot enough he would buy his wife which was owned on a farm close towhere miss watson lived and then they would both work to buy thetwo children and if their master wouldnt sell them theyd get anablitionist to go and steal themit most froze me to hear such talk  he wouldnt ever dared to talk suchtalk in his life before  just see what a difference it made in him theminute he judged he was about free  it was according to the old sayinggive a nigger an inch and hell take an ell  thinks i this is whatcomes of my not thinking  here was this nigger which i had as goodas helped to run away coming right out flatfooted and saying he wouldsteal his childrenchildren that belonged to a man i didnt even know aman that hadnt ever done me no harmi was sorry to hear jim say that it was such a lowering of him  myconscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever until at last i saysto it let up on meit aint too late yetill paddle ashore at thefirst light and tell  i felt easy and happy and light as a featherright off  all my troubles was gone  i went to looking out sharp for alight and sort of singing to myself  by and by one showed  jim singsoutwes safe huck wes safe  jump up and crack yo heels  dats degood ole cairo at las i jis knows iti saysill take the canoe and go and see jim  it mightnt be you knowhe jumped and got the canoe ready and put his old coat in the bottomfor me to set on and give me the paddle and as i shoved off he sayspooty soon ill be ashoutn for joy en ill say its all onaccounts o huck is a free man en

wigwam jim warnt there  i looked all around hewarnt anywhere  i saysjimhere i is huck  is dey out o sight yit  dont talk loudhe was in the river under the stern oar with just his nose out  i toldhim they were out of sight so he come aboard  he saysi was alistenin to all de talk en i slips into de river en was gwyneto shove for sho if dey come aboard  den i was gwyne to swim to deraf agin when dey was gone  but lawsy how you did fool em huck dat wuz de smartes dodge  i tell you chile ispec it save olejimole jim aint going to forgit you for dat honeythen we talked about the money  it was a pretty good raisetwentydollars apiece  jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboatnow and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the freestates he said twenty mile more warnt far for the raft to go but hewished we was already theretowards daybreak we tied up and jim was mighty particular about hidingthe raft good  then he worked all day fixing things in bundles andgetting all ready to quit raftingthat night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away downin a lefthand bendi went off in the canoe to ask about it  pretty soon i found a man outin the river with a skiff setting a trotline  i ranged up and saysmister is that town cairocairo no  you must be a blame foolwhat town is it misterif you want to know go and find out  if you stay here botherinaround me for about a half a minute longer youll get something youwont wanti paddled to the raft  jim was awful disappointed but i said nevermind cairo would be the next place i reckonedwe passed another town before daylight and i was going out again butit was high ground so i didnt go  no high ground about cairo jimsaid i had forgot it  we laid up for the day on a towhead tolerableclose to the lefthand bank  i begun to suspicion something  so didjim  i saysmaybe we went by cairo in the fog that nighthe saysdoan les talk about it huck  po niggers cant have no luck  iawluz spected dat rattlesnakeskin warnt done wid its worki wish id never seen that snakeskin jimi do wish id never laideyes on itit aint yo fault huck you didn know  dont you blame yoselfbout itwhen it was daylight here was the clear ohio water inshore sureenough and outside was the old regular muddy  so it was all up withcairowe talked it all over  it wouldnt do to take to the shore we couldnttake the raft up the stream of course  there warnt no way but to waitfor dark and start back in the canoe and take the chances  so we sleptall day amongst the cottonwood thicket so as to be fresh for the workand when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gonewe didnt say a word for a good while  there warnt anything tosay  we both knowed well enough it was some more work of therattlesnakeskin so what was the use to talk about it  it would onlylook like we was finding fault and that would be bound to fetch morebad luckand keep on fetching it too till we knowed enough to keepstillby and by we talked about what we better do and found there warnt noway but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buya canoe to go back in  we warnt going to borrow it when there warntanybody around the way pap would do for that might set people afterusso we shoved out after dark on the raftanybody that dont believe yet that its foolishness to handle asnakeskin after all that that snakeskin done for us will believe itnow if they read on and see what more it done for usthe place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore  but wedidnt see no rafts laying up so we went along during three hours andmore  well the night got gray and ruther thick which is the nextmeanest thing to fog  you cant tell the shape of the river and youcant see no distance it got to be very late and still and then alongcomes a steamboat up the river  we lit the lantern and judged shewould see it  upstream boats didnt generly come close to us theygo out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs butnights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole riverwe could hear her pounding along but we didnt see her good till shewas close  she aimed right for us  often they do that and try to seehow close they can come without touching sometimes the wheel bites offa sweep and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs and thinkshes mighty smart  well here she comes and we said she was going totry and shave us but she didnt seem to be sheering off a bit  shewas a big one and she was coming in a hurry too looking like a blackcloud with rows of glowworms around it but all of a sudden she bulgedout big and scary with a long row of wideopen furnace doors shininglike redhot teeth and her monstrous bows and guards hanging rightover us  there was a yell at us and a jingling of bells to stop theengines a powwow of cussing and whistling of steamand as jim wentoverboard on one side and i on the other she come smashing straightthrough the rafti divedand i aimed to find the bottom too for a thirtyfoot wheelhad got to go over me and i wanted it to have plenty of room  i couldalways stay under water a minute this time i reckon i stayed under aminute and a half  then i bounced for the top in a hurry for i wasnearly busting  i popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out ofmy nose and puffed a bit  of course there was a booming current andof course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after shestopped them for they never cared much for raftsmen so now she waschurning along up the river out of sight in the thick weather though icould hear heri sung out for jim about a dozen times but i didnt get any answerso i grabbed a plank that touched me while i was treading water andstruck out for shore shoving it ahead of me  but i made out to seethat the drift of the current was towards the lefthand shore whichmeant that i was in a crossing so i changed off and went that wayit was one of these long slanting twomile crossings so i was a goodlong time in getting over  i made a safe landing and clumb up thebank i couldnt see but a little ways but i went poking along overrough ground for a quarter of a mile or more and then i run across abig oldfashioned double loghouse before i noticed it  i was going torush by and get away but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howlingand barking at me and i knowed better than to move another pegin about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting hishead out and saysbe done boys  whos therei saysits mewhos megeorge jackson sirwhat do you wanti dont want nothing sir  i only want to go along by but

hand on the door and pushed it alittle and a little more till somebody said there thats enoughputyour head in i done it but i judged they would take it offthe candle was on the floor and there they

of them fine andhandsomeand the sweetest old grayheaded lady and back of her twoyoung women which i couldnt see right well  the old gentleman saysthere i reckon its all right  come inas soon as i was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred itand bolted it and told the young men to come in with their guns andthey all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floorand got together in a corner that was out of the range of the frontwindowsthere warnt none on the side  they held the candle and took agood look at me and all said why he aint a shepherdsonno thereaint any shepherdson about him  then the old man said he hoped iwouldnt mind being searched for arms because he didnt mean no harm byitit was only to make sure  so he didnt pry into my pockets but onlyfelt

there aint nothing better that ever ivecome across yet  buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipesexcept the nigger woman which was gone and the two young women  theyall smoked and talked and i eat and talked  the young women hadquilts around them and their hair down their backs  they all asked mequestions and i told them how pap and me and all the family was livingon a little farm down at the bottom of arkansaw and my sister mary annrun off and got married and never was heard of no more and bill wentto hunt them and he warnt heard of no more and tom and mort diedand then there warnt nobody but just me and pap left and he was justtrimmed down to nothing on account of his troubles so when he diedi took what there was left because the farm didnt belong to us andstarted up the river deck passage and fell overboard and that was howi come to be here  so they said i could have a home there as long as iwanted it  then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed and iwent to bed with buck and when i waked up in the morning drat it alli had forgot what my name was so i laid there about an hour trying tothink and when buck waked up i sayscan you spell buckyes he saysi bet you cant spell my name says ii bet you what you dare i can says heall right says i go aheadgeorge jaxonthere now he sayswell says i you done it but i didnt think you could  it aint noslouch of a name to spellright off without studyingi set it down private because somebody might want me to spell itnext and so i wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like i wasused to itit was a mighty nice family and a mighty nice house too  i hadntseen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so muchstyle  it didnt have an iron latch on the front door nor a wooden onewith a buckskin string but a brass knob to turn the same as houses intown there warnt no bed in the parlor nor a sign of a bed but heapsof parlors in towns has beds in them  there was a big fireplace thatwas bricked on the bottom and the bricks was kept clean and red bypouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick sometimesthey wash them over with red waterpaint that they call spanishbrownsame as they do in town  they had big brass dogirons that could holdup a sawlog there was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece witha picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front anda round place in the middle of it for the sun and you could see thependulum swinging behind it  it was beautiful to hear that clock tickand sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured herup and got her in good shape she would start in and strike a hundredand fifty before she got tuckered out  they wouldnt took any money forherwell there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clockmade out of something like chalk and painted up gaudy  by one of theparrots was a cat made of crockery and a crockery dog by the otherand when you pressed down on them they squeaked but didnt opentheir mouths nor look different nor interested  they squeaked throughunderneath  there was a couple of big wildturkeywing fans spread outbehind those things  on the table in the middle of the room was a kindof a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches andgrapes piled up in it which was much redder and yellower and prettierthan real ones is but they warnt real because you could see wherepieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk or whatever itwas underneaththis table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth with a red andblue spreadeagle painted on it and a painted border all around  itcome all the way from philadelphia they said  there was some bookstoo piled up perfectly exact on each corner of the table  one was abig family bible full of pictures  one was pilgrims progress about aman that left his family it didnt say why  i read considerable in itnow and then  the statements was interesting but tough  another wasfriendships offering full of beautiful stuff and poetry but i didntread the poetry  another was henry clays speeches and another was drgunns family medicine which told you all about what to do if a bodywas sick or dead  there was a hymn book and a lot of other books  andthere was nice splitbottom chairs and perfectly sound toonot baggeddown in the middle and busted like an old basketthey had pictures hung on the wallsmainly washingtons and lafayettesand battles and highland marys and one called signing thedeclaration there was some that they called crayons which one of thedaughters which was dead made her own self when she was onlyfifteen years old  they was different from any pictures i ever seebeforeblacker mostly than is common  one was a woman in a slim blackdress belted small under the armpits with bulges like a cabbage inthe middle of the sleeves and a large black scoopshovel bonnet witha black veil and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape andvery wee black slippers like a chisel and she was leaning pensive on atombstone on her right elbow under a weeping willow and her other handhanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticuleand underneath the picture it said shall i never see thee more alas  another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straightto the top of her head and knotted there in front of a comb like achairback and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead birdlaying on its back in her other hand with its heels up and underneaththe picture it said i shall never hear thy sweet chirrup more alas  there was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at themoon and tears running down her cheeks and she had an open letter inone hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it and she wasmashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth and underneaththe picture it said and art thou gone yes thou art gone alas  thesewas all nice pictures i reckon but i didnt somehow seem to taketo them because if ever i was down a little they always give me thefantods  everybody was sorry she died because she had laid out a lotmore of these pictures to do and a body could see by what she had donewhat they had lost  but i reckoned that with her disposition she washaving a better time in the graveyard  she was at work on what theysaid was her greatest picture when she took sick and every day andevery night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got itdone but she never got the chance  it was a picture of a young womanin a long white gown standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jumpoff with her hair all down her back and looking up to the moon withthe tears running down her face and she had two arms folded across herbreast and two arms stretched out in front and two more reaching uptowards the moonand the idea was to see which pair would look bestand then scratch out all the other arms but as i was saying she diedbefore she got her mind made up and now they kept this picture over thehead of the bed in her room and every time her birthday come they hungflowers on it  other times it was hid with a little curtain  the youngwoman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face but there was somany arms it made her look too spidery seemed to methis young girl kept a scrapbook when she was alive and used to pasteobituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of thepresbyterian observer and write poetry after them out of her own headit was very good poetry this is what she wrote about a boy by the nameof stephen dowling bots that fell down a well and was drowndedode to stephen dowling bots decdand did young stephen sicken    and did young stephen die and did thesad hearts thicken    and did the mourners cryno such was not the fate of    young stephen dowling bots though sadhearts round him thickened    twas not from sickness shotsno whoopingcough did rack his frame    nor measles drear with spotsnot these impaired the sacred name    of stephen dowling botsdespised love struck not with woe    that head of curly knots norstomach troubles laid him low    young stephen dowling botso no then list with tearful eye    whilst i his fate do tell his souldid from this cold world fly    by falling down a wellthey got him out and emptied him    alas it was too late his spiritwas gone for to sport aloft    in the realms of the good and greatif emmeline grangerford could make poetry like that before she wasfourteen there aint no telling what she could a done by and by  bucksaid she could rattle off poetry like nothing  she didnt ever have tostop to think  he said she would slap down a line and if she couldntfind anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap downanother one and go ahead she warnt particular she could write aboutanything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadfulevery time a man died or a woman died or a child died she would be onhand with her tribute before he was cold  she called them tributesthe neighbors said it was the doctor first then emmeline then theundertakerthe undertaker never got in ahead of emmeline but once andthen she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead persons name which waswhistler  she warnt ever the same after that she never complainedbut she kinder pined away and did not live long  poor thing manys thetime i made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and getout her poor old scrapbook and read in it when her pictures had beenaggravating me and i had soured on her a little  i liked all thatfamily dead ones and all and warnt going to let anything come betweenus  poor emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she wasalive and it didnt seem right that there warnt nobody to make someabout her now she was gone so i tried to sweat out a verse or twomyself but i couldnt seem to make it go somehow  they kept emmelinesroom trim and nice and all the things fixed in it just the way sheliked to have them when she was alive and nobody ever slept there the old lady took care of the room herself though there was plentyof niggers and she sewed there a good deal and read her bible theremostlywell as i was saying about the parlor there was beautiful curtains onthe windows  white with pictures painted on them of castles with vinesall down the walls and cattle coming down to drink  there was a littleold piano too that had tin pans in it i reckon and nothing was everso lovely as to hear the young ladies sing the last link is broken and play the battle of prague on it  the walls of all the rooms wasplastered and most had carpets on the floors and the whole house waswhitewashed on the outsideit was a double house and the big open place betwixt them was roofedand floored and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of theday and it was a cool comfortable place  nothing couldnt be better and warnt the cooking good and just bushels of it toocol  grangerford was a gentleman you see  he was a gentleman allover and so was his family  he was well born as the saying is andthats worth as much in a man as it is in a horse so the widow douglassaid and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracyin our town and pap he always said it too though he warnt no morequality than a mudcat himself  col  grangerford was very tall andvery slim and had a darkishpaly complexion not a sign of red in itanywheres he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face andhe had the thinnest kind of lips and the thinnest kind of nostrils anda high nose and heavy eyebrows and the blackest kind of eyes sunk sodeep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns atyou as you may say  his forehead was high and his hair was black andstraight and hung to his shoulders his hands was long and thin andevery day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from headto foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at itand on sundays he wore a blue tailcoat with brass buttons on it  hecarried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it  there warnt nofrivolishness about him not a bit and he warnt ever loud  he wasas kind as he could beyou could feel that you know and so you hadconfidence  sometimes he smiled and it was good to see but when hestraightened himself up like a libertypole and the lightning begun toflicker out from under his eyebrows you wanted to climb a tree firstand find out what the matter was afterwards  he didnt ever have totell anybody to mind their mannerseverybody was always goodmanneredwhere he was  everybody loved to have him around too he was sunshinemost alwaysi mean he made it seem like good weather  when he turnedinto a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute and that wasenough there wouldnt nothing go wrong again for a weekwhen him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family gotup out of their chairs and give them goodday and didnt set down againtill they had set down  then tom and bob went to the sideboard wherethe decanter was and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him andhe held it in his hand and waited till toms and bobs was mixed andthen they bowed and said our duty to you sir and madam and theybowed the least bit in the world and said thank you and so they drankall three and bob and tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar andthe mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers andgive it to me and buck and we drank to the old people toobob was the oldest and tom nexttall beautiful men with very broadshoulders and brown faces and long black hair and black eyes  theydressed in white linen from head to foot like the old gentleman andwore broad panama hatsthen there was miss charlotte she was twentyfive and tall and proudand grand but as good as she could be when she warnt stirred up butwhen she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your trackslike her father  she was beautifulso was her sister miss sophia but it was a different kind  she wasgentle and sweet like a dove and she was only twentyeach person had their own nigger to wait on thembuck too  my niggerhad a monstrous easy time because i warnt used to having anybody doanything for me but bucks was on the jump most of the timethis was all there was of the family now but there used to bemorethree sons they got killed and emmeline that diedthe old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggerssometimes a stack of people would come there horseback from ten orfifteen mile around and stay five or six days and have such junketingsround about and on the river and dances and picnics in the woodsdaytimes and balls at the house nights  these people was mostlykinfolks of the family  the men brought their guns with them  it was ahandsome lot of quality i tell youthere was another clan of aristocracy around therefive or sixfamiliesmostly of the name of shepherdson  they was as hightonedand well born and rich and grand as the tribe of grangerfords  theshepherdsons and grangerfords used the same steamboat landing which wasabout two mile above our house so sometimes when i went up there with alot of our folks i used to see a lot of the shepherdsons there on theirfine horsesone day buck and me was away out in the woods hunting and heard a horsecoming  we was crossing the road  buck saysquick  jump for the woodswe done it and then peeped down the woods through the leaves  prettysoon a splendid young man come galloping down the road setting hishorse easy and looking like a soldier  he had his gun across hispommel  i had seen him before  it was young harney shepherdson  iheard bucks gun go off at my ear and harneys hat tumbled off from hishead  he grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we washid  but we didnt wait  we started through the woods on a run  thewoods warnt thick so i looked over my shoulder to dodge the bulletand twice i seen harney cover buck with his gun and then he rode awaythe way he cometo get his hat i reckon but i couldnt see  we neverstopped running till we got home  the old gentlemans eyes blazed aminutetwas pleasure mainly i judgedthen his face sort of smootheddown and he says kind of gentlei dont like that shooting from behind a bush  why didnt you stepinto the road my boythe shepherdsons dont father  they always take advantagemiss charlotte she held her head up like a queen while buck was tellinghis tale and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped  the two youngmen looked dark but never said nothing  miss sophia she turned palebut the color come back when she found the man warnt hurtsoon as i could get buck down by the corncribs under the trees byourselves i saysdid you want to kill him buckwell i bet i didwhat did he do to youhim  he never done nothing to mewell then what did you want to kill him forwhy nothingonly its on account of the feudwhats a feudwhy where was you raised  dont you know what a feud isnever heard of it beforetell me about itwell says buck a feud is this way  a man has a quarrel withanother man and kills him then that other mans brother kills himthen the other brothers on both sides goes for one another then thecousins chip inand by and by everybodys killed off and there aintno more feud  but its kind of slow and takes a long timehas this one been going on long buckwell i should reckon  it started thirty year ago or somers alongthere  there was trouble bout something and then a lawsuit to settleit and the suit went agin one of the men and so he up and shot theman that won the suitwhich he would naturally do of course  anybodywouldwhat was the trouble about bucklandi reckon maybei dont knowwell who done the shooting  was it a grangerford or a shepherdsonlaws how do i know  it was so long agodont anybody knowoh yes pa knows i reckon and some of the other old people but theydont know now what the row was about in the first placehas there been many killed buckyes right smart chance of funerals  but they dont always kill  pasgot a few buckshot in him but he dont mind it cuz he dont weighmuch anyway  bobs been carved up some with a bowie and toms beenhurt once or twicehas anybody been killed this year buckyes we got one and they got one  bout three months ago my cousinbud fourteen year old was riding through the woods on tother sideof the river and didnt have no weapon with him which was blamefoolishness and in a lonesome place he hears a horse acoming behindhim and sees old baldy shepherdson alinkin after him with his gun inhis hand and his white hair aflying in the wind and stead of jumpingoff and taking to the brush bud lowed he could outrun him so theyhad it nip and tuck for five mile or more the old man againing allthe time so at last bud seen it warnt any use so he stopped and facedaround so as to have the bullet holes in front you know and the oldman he rode up and shot him down  but he didnt git much chance toenjoy his luck for inside of a week our folks laid him outi reckon that old man was a coward bucki reckon he warnt a coward  not by a blame sight  there aint acoward amongst them shepherdsonsnot a one  and there aint no cowardsamongst the grangerfords either  why that old man kep up his end in afight one day for half an hour against three grangerfords and comeout winner  they was all ahorseback he lit off of his horse and gotbehind a little woodpile and kep his horse before him to stop thebullets but the grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered aroundthe old man and peppered away at him and he peppered away at them him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled but thegrangerfords had to be fetched homeand one of em was dead andanother died the next day  no sir if a bodys out hunting for cowardshe dont want to fool away any time amongst them shepherdsons becuzthey dont breed any of that kindnext sunday we all went to church about three mile everybodyahorseback the men took their guns along so did buck and keptthem between their knees or stood them handy against the wall  theshepherdsons done the same  it was pretty ornery preachingall aboutbrotherly love and suchlike tiresomeness but everybody said it wasa good sermon and they all talked it over going home and had sucha powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace andpreforeordestination and i dont know what all that it did seem to meto be one of the roughest sundays i had run across yetabout an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around some in theirchairs and some in their rooms and it got to be pretty dull  buck anda dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep  i went upto our room and judged i would take a nap myself  i found that sweetmiss sophia standing in her door which was next to ours and she tookme in her room and shut the door very soft and asked me if i liked herand i said i did and she asked me if i would do something for her andnot tell anybody and i said i would  then she said shed forgot hertestament and left it in the seat at church between two other booksand would i slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her and not saynothing to nobody  i said i would so i slid out and slipped off up theroad and there warnt anybody at the church except maybe a hog or twofor there warnt any lock on the door and hogs likes a puncheon floorin summertime because its cool  if you notice most folks dont go tochurch only when theyve got to but a hog is differentsays i to myself somethings up it aint natural for a girl to be insuch a sweat about a testament  so i give it a shake and out drops alittle piece of paper with halfpast two wrote on it with a pencil  iransacked it but couldnt find anything else  i couldnt make anythingout of that so i put the paper in the book again and when i got homeand upstairs there was miss sophia in her door waiting for me  shepulled me in and shut the door then she looked in the testament tillshe found the paper and as soon as she read it she looked glad andbefore a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze andsaid i was the best boy in the world and not to tell anybody  she wasmighty red in the face for a minute and her eyes lighted up and itmade her powerful pretty  i was a good deal astonished but when i gotmy breath i asked her what the paper was about and she asked me if ihad read it and i said no and she asked me if i could read writingand i told her no only coarsehand and then she said the paperwarnt anything but a bookmark to keep her place and i might go andplay nowi went off down to the river studying over this thing and pretty sooni noticed that my nigger was following along behind  when we was outof sight of the house he looked back and around a second and then comesarunning and saysmars jawge if

woodpile where the steamboats lands i worked along under the treesand brush till i got to a good place and then i clumb up into theforks of a cottonwood that was out of reach and watched  there was awoodrank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree and first iwas going to hide behind that but maybe it was luckier i didntthere was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the openplace before the log store cussing and yelling and trying to get ata couple of young chaps that was behind the woodrank alongside of thesteamboat landing but they couldnt come it  every time one of themshowed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at  thetwo boys was squatting back to back behind the pile so they could watchboth waysby and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling  they startedriding towards the store then up gets one of the boys draws a steadybead over the woodrank and drops one of them out of his saddle  allthe men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and startedto carry him to the store and that minute the two boys started on therun  they got half way to the tree i was in before the men noticedthen the men see them and jumped on their horses and took out afterthem  they gained on the boys but it didnt do no good the boys hadtoo good a start they got to the woodpile that was in front of my treeand slipped in behind it and so they had the bulge on the men againone of the boys was buck and the other was a slim young chap aboutnineteen years oldthe men ripped around awhile and then rode away  as soon as they wasout of sight i sung out to buck and told him  he didnt know whatto make of my voice coming out of the tree at first  he was awfulsurprised  he told me
