charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we havedetermined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spendhis vacant hours in a comfortless hotel many of my acquaintances arealready there for the winter i wish that i could hear that you mydearest friend had any intention of making one of the crowdbut ofthat i despair i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire mayabound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that yourbeaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of thethree of whom we shall deprive youit is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more thiswinterit is only evident that miss bingley does not mean that he shouldwhy will you think so it must be his own doing he is his ownmaster but you do not know all i will read you the passage whichparticularly hurts me i will have no reserves from youmr darcy is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truthwe are scarcely less eager to meet her again i really do not thinkgeorgiana darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishmentsand the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened intosomething still more interesting from the hope we dare entertain ofher being hereafter our sister i do not know whether i ever beforementioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave thecountry without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem themunreasonable my brother admires her greatly already he will havefrequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footingher relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a sisterspartiality is not misleading me i think when i call charles mostcapable of engaging any womans heart with all these circumstances tofavour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearestjane in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happinessof so manywhat do you think of this sentence my dear lizzy said jane as shefinished it is it not clear enough does it not expressly declare thatcaroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she isperfectly convinced of her brothers indifference and that if shesuspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly toput me on my guard can there be any other opinion on the subjectyes there can for mine is totally different will you hear itmost willinglyyou shall have it in a few words miss bingley sees that her brother isin love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy she follows himto town in hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that hedoes not care about youjane shook her headindeed jane you ought to believe me no one who has ever seen youtogether can doubt his affection miss bingley i am sure cannot sheis not such a simpleton could she have seen half as much love in mrdarcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes but thecase is this we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and sheis the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notionthat when there has been one intermarriage she may have less troublein achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity andi dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way butmy dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingleytells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallestdegree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you ontuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that insteadof being in love with you he is very much in love with her friendif we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane yourrepresentation of all this might make me quite easy but i know thefoundation is unjust caroline is incapable of wilfully deceivinganyone and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceivingherselfthat is right you could not have started a more happy idea since youwill not take comfort in mine believe her to be deceived by all meansyou have now done your duty by her and must fret no longerbut my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best inaccepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marryelsewhereyou must decide for yourself said elizabeth and if upon maturedeliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters ismore than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you byall means to refuse himhow can you talk so said jane faintly smiling you must know thatthough i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i couldnot hesitatei did not think you would and that being the case i cannot consideryour situation with much compassionbut if he returns no more this winter my choice will never berequired a thousand things may arise in six monthsthe idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmostcontempt it appeared to her merely the suggestion of carolinesinterested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that thosewishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young manso totally independent of everyoneshe represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felton the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effectjanes temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hopethough the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope thatbingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heartthey agreed that mrs bennet should only hear of the departure of thefamily without being alarmed on the score of the gentlemans conductbut even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concernand she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happento go away just as they were all getting so intimate together afterlamenting it however at some length she had the consolation that mrbingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and theconclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he hadbeen invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have twofull coursesthe bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during thechief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr collinselizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her it keeps him in goodhumour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful andthat it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time this wasvery amiable but charlottes kindness extended farther than elizabethhad any conception of its object was nothing else than to secure herfrom any return of mr collinss addresses by engaging them towardsherself such was miss lucass scheme and appearances were sofavourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almostsecure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so verysoon but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of hischaracter for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the nextmorning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throwhimself at her feet he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousinsfrom a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail toconjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt knowntill its success might be known likewise for though feeling almostsecure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraginghe was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesdayhis reception however was of the most flattering kind miss lucasperceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house andinstantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane but little hadshe dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her therein as short a time as mr collinss long speeches would alloweverything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and asthey entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day thatwas to make him the happiest of men and though such a solicitation mustbe waived for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle withhis happiness the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature mustguard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for itscontinuance and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pureand disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon thatestablishment were gainedsir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consentand it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity mr collinss presentcircumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whomthey could give little fortune and his prospects of future wealth wereexceedingly fair lady lucas began directly to calculate with moreinterest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longermr bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decidedopinion that whenever mr collins should be in possession of thelongbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wifeshould make their appearance at st jamess the whole family in shortwere properly overjoyed on the occasion the younger girls formed hopesof coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise havedone and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlottesdying an old maid charlotte herself was tolerably composed she hadgained her point and had time to consider of it her reflections werein general satisfactory mr collins to be sure was neither sensiblenor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her mustbe imaginary but still he would be her husband without thinking highlyeither of men or matrimony marriage had always been her object it wasthe only provision for welleducated young women of small fortuneand however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantestpreservative from want this preservative she had now obtained and atthe age of twentyseven without having ever been handsome she felt allthe good luck of it the least agreeable circumstance in the businesswas the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendshipshe valued beyond that of any other person elizabeth would wonderand probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to beshaken her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation she resolvedto give her the information herself and therefore charged mr collinswhen he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what hadpassed before any of the family a promise of secrecy was of course verydutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty for thecuriosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very directquestions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he wasat the same time exercising great selfdenial for he was longing topublish his prosperous loveas he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of thefamily the ceremony of leavetaking was performed when the ladies movedfor the night and mrs bennet with great politeness and cordialitysaid how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again wheneverhis engagements might allow him to visit themmy dear madam he replied this invitation is particularlygratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive andyou may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon aspossiblethey were all astonished and mr bennet who could by no means wish forso speedy a return immediately saidbut is there not danger of lady catherines disapprobation here mygood sir you had better neglect your relations than run the risk ofoffending your patronessmy dear sir replied mr collins i am particularly obliged to youfor this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking somaterial a step without her ladyships concurrenceyou cannot be too much upon your guard risk anything rather than herdispleasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to usagain which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at homeand be satisfied that we shall take no offencebelieve me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by suchaffectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receivefrom me a letter of thanks for this and for every other mark of yourregard during my stay in hertfordshire as for my fair cousins thoughmy absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall nowtake the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting mycousin elizabethwith proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them equallysurprised that he meditated a quick return mrs bennet wished tounderstand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of heryounger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept himshe rated his abilities much higher than any of the others there wasa solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by nomeans so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to readand improve himself by such an example as hers he might become a veryagreeable companion but on the following morning every hope of thiskind was done away miss lucas called soon after breakfast and in aprivate conference with elizabeth related the event of the day beforethe possibility of mr collinss fancying himself in love with herfriend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two butthat charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far frompossibility as she could encourage him herself and her astonishment wasconsequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum andshe could not help crying outengaged to mr collins my dear charlotteimpossiblethe steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling herstory gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct areproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon regainedher composure and calmly repliedwhy should you be surprised my dear eliza do you think it incrediblethat mr collins should be able to procure any womans good opinionbecause he was not so happy as to succeed with youbut elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effortfor it was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect oftheir relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished herall imaginable happinessi see what you are feeling replied charlotte you must be surprisedvery much surprisedso lately as mr collins was wishing to marryyou but when you have had time to think it over i hope you will besatisfied with what i have done i am not romantic you know i neverwas i ask only a comfortable home and considering mr collinsscharacter connection and situation in life i am convinced that mychance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast onentering the marriage stateelizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly and after an awkward pausethey returned to the rest of the family charlotte did not stay muchlonger and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heardit was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of sounsuitable a match the strangeness of mr collinss making two offersof marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being nowaccepted she had always felt that charlottes opinion of matrimony wasnot exactly like her own but she had not supposed it to be possiblethat when called into action she would have sacrificed every betterfeeling to worldly advantage charlotte the wife of mr collins was amost humiliating picture and to the pang of a friend disgracing herselfand sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction that itwas impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she hadchosenelizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on whatshe had heard and doubting whether she was authorised to mentionit when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter toannounce her engagement to the family with many compliments to themand much selfgratulation on the prospect of a connection between thehouses he unfolded the matterto an audience not merely wondering butincredulous for mrs bennet with more perseverance than politenessprotested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded andoften uncivil boisterously exclaimedgood lord sir william how can you tell such a story do not you knowthat mr collins wants to marry lizzynothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have bornewithout anger such treatment but sir williams good breeding carriedhim through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to thetruth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with themost forbearing courtesyelizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasanta situation now put herself forward to confirm his account bymentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself andendeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sistersby the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which shewas readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on thehappiness that might be expected from the match the excellent characterof mr collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from londonmrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal whilesir william remained but no sooner had he left them than her feelingsfound a rapid vent in the first place she persisted in disbelievingthe whole of the matter secondly she was very sure that mr collinshad been taken in thirdly she trusted that they would never behappy together and fourthly that the match might be broken off twoinferences however were plainly deduced from the whole one thatelizabeth was the real cause of the mischief and the other that sheherself had been barbarously misused by them all and on these twopoints she principally dwelt during the rest of the day nothing couldconsole and nothing could appease her nor did that day wear out herresentment a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth withoutscolding her a month passed away before she could speak to sir williamor lady lucas without being rude and many months were gone before shecould at all forgive their daughtermr bennets emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and suchas he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort forit gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he hadbeen used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife andmore foolish than his daughterjane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she saidless of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happinessnor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable kittyand lydia were far from envying miss lucas for mr collins was only aclergyman and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of newsto spread at merytonlady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retorton mrs bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married and shecalled at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she wasthough mrs bennets sour looks and illnatured remarks might have beenenough to drive happiness awaybetween elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept themmutually silent on the subject and elizabeth felt persuaded thatno real confidence could ever subsist between them again herdisappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to hersister of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion couldnever be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxiousas bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of hisreturnjane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was countingthe days till she might reasonably hope to hear again the promisedletter of thanks from mr collins arrived on tuesday addressed totheir father and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which atwelvemonths abode in the family might have prompted after discharginghis conscience on that head he proceeded to inform them with manyrapturous expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affectionof their amiable neighbour miss lucas and then explained that it wasmerely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so readyto close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn whitherhe hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight for lady catherinehe added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to takeplace as soon as possible which he trusted would be an unanswerableargument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making himthe happiest of menmr collinss return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter ofpleasure to mrs bennet on the contrary she was as much disposed tocomplain of it as her husband it was very strange that he should cometo longbourn instead of to lucas lodge it was also very inconvenientand exceedingly troublesome she hated having visitors in the housewhile her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people themost disagreeable such were the gentle murmurs of mrs bennet andthey gave way only to the greater distress of mr bingleys continuedabsenceneither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject day afterday passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than thereport which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more tonetherfield the whole winter a report which highly incensed mrsbennet and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalousfalsehoodeven elizabeth began to fearnot that bingley was indifferentbut thathis sisters would be successful in keeping him away unwilling asshe was to admit an idea so destructive of janes happiness and sodishonorable to the stability of her lover she could not prevent itsfrequently occurring the united efforts of his two unfeeling sistersand of his overpowering friend assisted by the attractions of missdarcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared forthe strength of his attachmentas for jane her anxiety under this suspense was of course morepainful than elizabeths but whatever she felt she was desirous ofconcealing and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subjectwas never alluded to but as no such delicacy restrained her motheran hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express herimpatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if hedid not come back she would think herself very ill used it neededall janes steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerabletranquillitymr collins returned most punctually on monday fortnight but hisreception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on hisfirst introduction he was too happy however to need much attentionand luckily for the others the business of lovemaking relieved themfrom a great deal of his company the chief of every day was spent byhim at lucas lodge and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in timeto make an apology for his absence before the family went to bedmrs bennet was really in a most pitiable state the very mention ofanything concerning the match threw her into an agony of illhumourand wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of the sightof miss lucas was odious to her as her successor in that house sheregarded her with jealous abhorrence whenever charlotte came to seethem she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession andwhenever she spoke in a low voice to mr collins was convinced thatthey were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herselfand her daughters out of the house as soon as mr bennet were dead shecomplained bitterly of all this to her husbandindeed mr bennet said she it is very hard to think that charlottelucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced tomake way for her and live to see her take her place in itmy dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts let us hope forbetter things let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivorthis was not very consoling to mrs bennet and therefore instead ofmaking any answer she went on as beforei cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate if it wasnot for the entail i should not mind itwhat should not you mindi should not mind anything at alllet us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of suchinsensibilityi never can be thankful mr bennet for anything about the entail howanyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from ones owndaughters i cannot understand and all for the sake of mr collins toowhy should he have it more than anybody elsei leave it to yourself to determine said mr bennetmiss bingleys letter arrived and put an end to doubt the very firstsentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london forthe winter and concluded with her brothers regret at not having hadtime to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he leftthe countryhope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the restof the letter she found little except the professed affection of thewriter that could give her any comfort miss darcys praise occupiedthe chief of it her many attractions were again dwelt on and carolineboasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predictthe accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her formerletter she wrote also with great pleasure of her brothers being aninmate of mr darcys house and mentioned with raptures some plans ofthe latter with regard to new furnitureelizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all thisheard it in silent indignation her heart was divided between concernfor her sister and resentment against all others to carolinesassertion of her brothers being partial to miss darcy she paid nocredit that he was really fond of jane she doubted no more than shehad ever done and much as she had always been disposed to like him shecould not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easinessof temper that want of proper resolution which now made him the slaveof his designing friends and led him to sacrifice of his own happinessto the caprice of their inclination had his own happiness howeverbeen the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to sport with it inwhatever manner he thought best but her sisters was involved in it asshe thought he must be sensible himself it was a subject in shorton which reflection would be long indulged and must be unavailing shecould think of nothing else and yet whether bingleys regard had reallydied away or were suppressed by his friends interference whetherhe had been aware of janes attachment or whether it had escaped hisobservation whatever were the case though her opinion of him must bematerially affected by the difference her sisters situation remainedthe same her peace equally woundeda day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings toelizabeth but at last on mrs bennets leaving them together after alonger irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she couldnot help sayingoh that my dear mother had more command over herself she can have noidea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him buti will not repine it cannot last long he will be forgot and we shallall be as we were beforeelizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but saidnothingyou doubt me cried jane slightly colouring indeed you haveno reason he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of myacquaintance but that is all i have nothing either to hope or fearand nothing to reproach him with thank god i have not that pain alittle time thereforei shall certainly try to get the betterwith a stronger voice she soon added i have this comfort immediatelythat it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that ithas done no harm to anyone but myselfmy dear jane exclaimed elizabeth you are too good your sweetnessand disinterestedness are really angelic i do not know what to sayto you i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as youdeservemiss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit and threw backthe praise on her sisters warm affectionnay said elizabeth this is not fair you wish to think all theworld respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of anybody i only wantto think you perfect and you set yourself against it do notbe afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on yourprivilege of universal goodwill you need not there are few peoplewhom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well the more i seeof the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day confirmsmy belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of thelittle dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit orsense i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention theother is charlottes marriage it is unaccountable in every view it isunaccountablemy dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these they willruin your happiness you do not make allowance enough for differenceof situation and temper consider mr collinss respectability andcharlottes steady prudent character remember that she is one of alarge family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and beready to believe for everybodys sake that she may feel something likeregard and esteem for our cousinto oblige you i would try to believe almost anything but no one elsecould be benefited by such a belief as this for were i persuaded thatcharlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of herunderstanding than i now do of her heart my dear jane mr collins is aconceited pompous narrowminded silly man you know he is as well asi do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who married himcannot have a proper way of thinking you shall not defend her thoughit is charlotte lucas you shall not for the sake of one individualchange the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuadeyourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility ofdanger security for happinessi must think your language too strong in speaking of both repliedjane and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happytogether but enough of this you alluded to something else youmentioned two instances i cannot misunderstand you but i entreatyou dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame andsaying your opinion of him is sunk we must not be so ready to fancyourselves intentionally injured we must not expect a lively young manto be always so guarded and circumspect it is very often nothing butour own vanity that deceives us women fancy admiration means more thanit doesand men take care that they shouldif it is designedly done they cannot be justified but i have no ideaof there being so much design in the world as some persons imaginei am far from attributing any part of mr bingleys conduct to design said elizabeth but without scheming to do wrong or to make othersunhappy there may be error and there may be misery thoughtlessnesswant of attention to other peoples feelings and want of resolutionwill do the businessand do you impute it to either of thoseyes to the last but if i go on i shall displease you by saying whati think of persons you esteem stop me whilst you canyou persist then in supposing his sisters influence himyes in conjunction with his friendi cannot believe it why should they try to influence him they canonly wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman cansecure ityour first position is false they may wish many things besides hishappiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence theymay wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money greatconnections and pridebeyond a doubt they do wish him to choose miss darcy replied janebut this may be from better feelings than you are supposing they haveknown her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they loveher better but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikelythey should have opposed their brothers what sister would thinkherself at liberty to do it unless there were something veryobjectionable if they believed him attached to me they would not tryto part us if he were so they could not succeed by supposing such anaffection you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong and me mostunhappy do not distress me by the idea i am not ashamed of having beenmistakenor at least it is light it is nothing in comparison of whati should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters let me take it inthe best light in the light in which it may be understoodelizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time mr bingleysname was scarcely ever mentioned between themmrs bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning nomore and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not accountfor it clearly there was little chance of her ever considering it withless perplexity her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what shedid not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely theeffect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw herno more but though the probability of the statement was admitted atthe time she had the same story to repeat every day mrs bennets bestcomfort was that mr bingley must be down again in the summermr bennet treated the matter differently so lizzy said he one dayyour sister is crossed in love i find i congratulate her next tobeing married a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and thenit is something to think of and it gives her a sort of distinctionamong her companions when is your turn to come you will hardly bear tobe long outdone by jane now is your time here are officers enough inmeryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country let wickhambe your man he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditablythank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me we must notall expect janes good fortunetrue said mr bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever ofthat kind may befall you you have an affectionate mother who will makethe most of itmr wickhams society was of material service in dispelling the gloomwhich the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbournfamily they saw him often and to his other recommendations was nowadded that of general unreserve the whole of what elizabeth had alreadyheard his claims on mr darcy and all that he had suffered from himwas now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and everybody waspleased to know how much they had always disliked mr darcy before theyhad known anything of the mattermiss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might beany extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the societyof hertfordshire her mild and steady candour always pleaded forallowances and urged the possibility of mistakesbut by everybody elsemr darcy was condemned as the worst of menafter a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicitymr collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival ofsaturday the pain of separation however might be alleviated on hisside by preparations for the reception of his bride as he had reasonto hope that shortly after his return into hertfordshire the day wouldbe fixed that was to make him the happiest of men he took leave of hisrelations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished his faircousins health and happiness again and promised their father anotherletter of thankson the following monday mrs bennet had the pleasure of receivingher brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmasat longbourn mr gardiner was a sensible gentlemanlike man greatlysuperior to his sister as well by nature as education the netherfieldladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who livedby trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been sowellbred and agreeable mrs gardiner who was several years youngerthan mrs bennet and mrs phillips was an amiable intelligent elegantwoman and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces between thetwo eldest and herself especially there subsisted a particular regardthey had frequently been staying with her in townthe first part of mrs gardiners business on her arrival was todistribute her presents and describe the newest fashions when this wasdone she had a less active part to play it became her turn to listenmrs bennet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of theyhad all been very illused since she last saw her sister two of hergirls had been upon the point of marriage and after all there wasnothing in iti do not blame jane she continued for jane would have got mrbingley if she could but lizzy oh sister it is very hard to thinkthat she might have been mr collinss wife by this time had it notbeen for her own perverseness he made her an offer in this very roomand she refused him the consequence of it is that lady lucas will havea daughter married before i have and that the longbourn estate is justas much entailed as ever the lucases are very artful people indeedsister they are all for what they can get i am sorry to say it ofthem but so it is it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwartedso in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselvesbefore anybody else however your coming just at this time is thegreatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us oflong sleevesmrs gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given beforein the course of jane and elizabeths correspondence with her made hersister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned theconversationwhen alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject itseems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she i amsorry it went off but these things happen so often a young man suchas you describe mr bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girlfor a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgetsher that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequentan excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will notdo for us we do not suffer by accident it does not oftenhappen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man ofindependent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently inlove with only a few days beforebut that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed sodoubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea it is asoften applied to feelings which arise from a halfhours acquaintanceas to a real strong attachment pray how violent was mr bingleyslovei never saw a more promising inclination he was growing quiteinattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her every timethey met it was more decided and remarkable at his own ball heoffended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and ispoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer could there befiner symptoms is not general incivility the very essence of loveoh yesof that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt poorjane i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not getover it immediately it had better have happened to you lizzy youwould have laughed yourself out of it sooner but do you think shewould be prevailed upon to go back with us change of scene might beof serviceand perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful asanythingelizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuadedof her sisters ready acquiescencei hope added mrs gardiner that no consideration with regard tothis young man will influence her we live in so different a part oftown all our connections are so different and as you well know we goout so little that it is very improbable that they should meet at allunless he really comes to see herand that is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of hisfriend and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in sucha part of london my dear aunt how could you think of it mr darcy mayperhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but hewould hardly think a months ablution enough to cleanse him from itsimpurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it mr bingleynever stirs without himso much the better i hope they will not meet at all but does not janecorrespond with his sister she will not be able to help callingshe will drop the acquaintance entirelybut in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place thispoint as well as the still more interesting one of bingleys beingwithheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject whichconvinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirelyhopeless it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable thathis affection might be reanimated and the influence of his friendssuccessfully combated by the more natural influence of janesattractionsmiss bennet accepted her aunts invitation with pleasure and thebingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as shehoped by carolines not living in the same house with her brothershe might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger ofseeing himthe gardiners stayed a week at longbourn and what with the phillipsesthe lucases and the officers there was not a day without itsengagement mrs bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainmentof her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a familydinner when the engagement was for home some of the officers alwaysmade part of itof which officers mr wickham was sure to be one andon these occasions mrs gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabethswarm commendation narrowly observed them both without supposing themfrom what she saw to be very seriously in love their preferenceof each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy andshe resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she lefthertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging suchan attachmentto mrs gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasureunconnected with his general powers about ten or a dozen years agobefore her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that verypart of derbyshire to which he belonged they had therefore manyacquaintances in common and though wickham had been little there sincethe death of darcys father it was yet in his power to give her fresherintelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way ofprocuringmrs gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late mr darcy bycharacter perfectly well here consequently was an inexhaustible subjectof discourse in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minutedescription which wickham could give and in bestowing her tribute ofpraise on the character of its late possessor she was delighting bothhim and herself on being made acquainted with the present mr darcystreatment of him she tried to remember some of that gentlemansreputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it andwas confident at last that she recollected having heard mr fitzwilliamdarcy formerly spoken of as a very proud illnatured boymrs gardiners caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly givenon the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone afterhonestly telling her what she thought she thus went onyou are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely becauseyou are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speakingopenly seriously i would have you be on your guard do not involveyourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the wantof fortune would make so very imprudent i have nothing to say againsthim he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune heought to have i should think you could not do better but as it is youmust not let your fancy run away with you you have sense and we allexpect you to use it your father would depend on your resolution andgood conduct i am sure you must not disappoint your fathermy dear aunt this is being serious indeedyes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewisewell then you need not be under any alarm i will take care ofmyself and of mr wickham too he shall not be in love with me if ican prevent itelizabeth you are not serious nowi beg your pardon i will try again at present i am not in love withmr wickham no i certainly am not but he is beyond all comparisonthe most agreeable man i ever sawand if he becomes really attached tomei believe it will be better that he should not i see the imprudenceof it oh that abominable mr darcy my fathers opinion of me doesme the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it myfather however is partial to mr wickham in short my dear aunt ishould be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy butsince we see every day that where there is affection young peopleare seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering intoengagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so manyof my fellowcreatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that itwould be wisdom to resist all that i can promise you therefore is notto be in a hurry i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his firstobject when i am in company with him i will not be wishing in shorti will do my bestperhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so veryoften at least you should not remind your mother of inviting himas i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile verytrue it will be wise in me to refrain from that but do not imaginethat he is always here so often it is on your account that he has beenso frequently invited this week you know my mothers ideas as to thenecessity of constant company for her friends but really and upon myhonour i will try to do what i think to be the wisest and now i hopeyou are satisfiedher aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her forthe kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advicebeing given on such a point without being resentedmr collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quittedby the gardiners and jane but as he took up his abode with the lucaseshis arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs bennet his marriage wasnow fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to thinkit inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an illnatured tone thatshe wished they might be happy thursday was to be the wedding dayand on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit and when sherose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mothers ungracious andreluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied herout of the room as they went downstairs together charlotte saidi shall depend on hearing from you very often elizathat you certainly shalland i have another favour to ask you will you come and see mewe shall often meet i hope in hertfordshirei am not likely to leave kent for some time promise me therefore tocome to hunsfordelizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in thevisitmy father and maria are coming to me in march added charlotte and ihope you will consent to be of the party indeed eliza you will be aswelcome as either of themthe wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for kent fromthe church door and everybody had as much to say or to hear onthe subject as usual elizabeth soon heard from her friend and theircorrespondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been thatit should be equally unreserved was impossible elizabeth could neveraddress her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was overand though determined not to slacken as a correspondent it was for thesake of what had been rather than what was charlottes first letterswere received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but becuriosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she wouldlike lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself tobe though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotteexpressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen shewrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothingwhich she could not praise the house furniture neighbourhood androads were all to her taste and lady catherines behaviour was mostfriendly and obliging it was mr collinss picture of hunsford androsings rationally softened and elizabeth perceived that she must waitfor her own visit there to know the restjane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce theirsafe arrival in london and when she wrote again elizabeth hoped itwould be in her power to say something of the bingleysher impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatiencegenerally is jane had been a week in town without either seeing orhearing from caroline she accounted for it however by supposing thather last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident beenlostmy aunt she continued is going tomorrow into that part of thetown and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor streetshe wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingleyi did not think caroline in spirits were her words but she was veryglad to see me and reproached me for giving her no notice of my comingto london i was right therefore my last letter had never reachedher i inquired after their brother of course he was well but so muchengaged with mr darcy that they scarcely ever saw him i found thatmiss darcy was expected to dinner i wish i could see her my visit wasnot long as caroline and mrs hurst were going out i dare say i shallsee them soon hereelizabeth shook her head over this letter it convinced her thataccident only could discover to mr bingley her sisters being in townfour weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of him she endeavoured topersuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer beblind to miss bingleys inattention after waiting at home every morningfor a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her thevisitor did at last appear but the shortness of her stay and yet morethe alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself nolonger the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister willprove what she feltmy dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in herbetter judgement at my expense when i confess myself to have beenentirely deceived in miss bingleys regard for me but my dear sisterthough the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if istill assert that considering what her behaviour was my confidence wasas natural as your suspicion i do not at all comprehend her reason forwishing to be intimate with me but if the same circumstances were tohappen again i am sure i should be deceived again caroline did notreturn my visit till yesterday and not a note not a line did ireceive in the meantime when she did come it was very evident thatshe had no pleasure in it she made a slight formal apology for notcalling before said not a word of wishing to see me again and wasin every respect so altered a creature that when she went away i wasperfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer i pitythough i cannot help blaming her she was very wrong in singling me outas she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began onher side but i pity her because she must feel that she has been actingwrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is thecause of it i need not explain myself farther and though we knowthis anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easilyaccount for her behaviour to me and so deservedly dear as he is tohis sister whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural andamiable i cannot but wonder however at her having any such fears nowbecause if he had at all cared about me we must have met long agohe knows of my being in town i am certain from something she saidherself and yet it would seem by her manner of talking as if shewanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy icannot understand it if i were not afraid of judging harshly i shouldbe almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicityin all this but i will endeavour to banish every painful thoughtand think only of what will make me happyyour affection and theinvariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt let me hear from you verysoon miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfieldagain of giving up the house but not with any certainty we had betternot mention it i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accountsfrom our friends at hunsford pray go to see them with sir william andmaria i am sure you will be very comfortable thereyours etcthis letter gave elizabeth some pain but her spirits returned as sheconsidered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at leastall expectation from the brother was now absolutely over she would noteven wish for a renewal of his attentions his character sunk onevery review of it and as a punishment for him as well as a possibleadvantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mrdarcys sister as by wickhams account she would make him abundantlyregret what he had thrown awaymrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promiseconcerning that gentleman and required information and elizabethhad such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than toherself his apparent partiality had subsided his attentions were overhe was the admirer of some one else elizabeth was watchful enough tosee it all but she could see it and write of it without material painher heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfiedwith believing that she would have been his only choice had fortunepermitted it the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the mostremarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himselfagreeable but elizabeth less clearsighted perhaps in this case thanin charlottes did not quarrel with him for his wish of independencenothing on the contrary could be more natural and while able tosuppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her she wasready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both and could verysincerely wish him happyall this was acknowledged to mrs gardiner and after relating thecircumstances she thus went on i am now convinced my dear aunt thati have never been much in love for had i really experienced that pureand elevating passion i should at present detest his very name andwish him all manner of evil but my feelings are not only cordialtowards him they are even impartial towards miss king i cannot findout that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwilling tothink her a very good sort of girl there can be no love in all this mywatchfulness has been effectual and though i certainly should be a moreinteresting object to all my acquaintances were i distractedly in lovewith him i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificanceimportance may sometimes be purchased too dearly kitty and lydia takehis defection much more to heart than i do they are young in theways of the world and not yet open to the mortifying conviction thathandsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plainwith no greater events than these in the longbourn family and otherwisediversified by little beyond the walks to meryton sometimes dirty andsometimes cold did january and february pass away march was to takeelizabeth to hunsford she had not at first thought very seriously ofgoing thither but charlotte she soon found was depending on the planand she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasureas well as greater certainty absence had increased her desire of seeingcharlotte again and weakened her disgust of mr collins therewas novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and suchuncompanionable sisters home could not be faultless a little changewas not unwelcome for its own sake the journey would moreover give hera peep at jane and in short as the time drew near she would havebeen very sorry for any delay everything however went on smoothlyand was finally settled according to charlottes first sketch she wasto accompany sir william and his second daughter the improvementof spending a night in london was added in time and the plan becameperfect as plan could bethe only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss herand who when it came to the point so little liked her going that hetold her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letterthe farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly friendly onhis side even more his present pursuit could not make him forget thatelizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention thefirst to listen and to pity the first to be admired and in his mannerof bidding her adieu wishing her every enjoyment reminding her ofwhat she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh and trusting theiropinion of hertheir opinion of everybodywould always coincide therewas a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her tohim with a most sincere regard and she parted from him convinced thatwhether married or single he must always be her model of the amiableand pleasingher fellowtravellers the next day were not of a kind to make herthink him less agreeable sir william lucas and his daughter maria agoodhumoured girl but as emptyheaded as himself had nothing to saythat could be worth hearing and were listened to with about as muchdelight as the rattle of the chaise elizabeth loved absurdities butshe had known sir williams too long he could tell her nothing new ofthe wonders of his presentation and knighthood and his civilities wereworn out like his informationit was a journey of only twentyfour miles and they began it so earlyas to be in gracechurch street by noon as they drove to mr gardinersdoor jane was at a drawingroom window watching their arrival whenthey entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabethlooking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it healthful andlovely as ever on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girlswhose eagerness for their cousins appearance would not allow them towait in the drawingroom and whose shyness as they had not seenher for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower all was joy andkindness the day passed most pleasantly away the morning in bustle andshopping and the evening at one of the theatreselizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt their first object was hersister and she was more grieved than astonished to hear in reply toher minute inquiries that though jane always struggled to support herspirits there were periods of dejection it was reasonable howeverto hope that they would not continue long mrs gardiner gave her theparticulars also of miss bingleys visit in gracechurch street andrepeated conversations occurring at different times between jane andherself which proved that the former had from her heart given up theacquaintancemrs gardiner then rallied her niece on wickhams desertion andcomplimented her on bearing it so wellbut my dear elizabeth she added what sort of girl is miss king ishould be sorry to think our friend mercenarypray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairsbetween the mercenary and the prudent motive where does discretion endand avarice begin last christmas you were afraid of his marrying mebecause it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to geta girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he ismercenaryif you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall knowwhat to thinkshe is a very good kind of girl i believe i know no harm of herbut he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfathers deathmade her mistress of this fortunenowhy should he if it were not allowable for him to gain myaffections because i had no money what occasion could there be formaking love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equallypoorbut there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards herso soon after this eventa man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegantdecorums which other people may observe if she does not object to itwhy should weher not objecting does not justify him it only shows her beingdeficient in something herselfsense or feelingwell cried elizabeth have it as you choose he shall bemercenary and she shall be foolishno lizzy that is what i do not choose i should be sorry you knowto think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshireoh if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live inderbyshire and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are notmuch better i am sick of them all thank heaven i am going tomorrowwhere i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who hasneither manner nor sense to recommend him stupid men are the only onesworth knowing after alltake care lizzy that speech savours strongly of disappointmentbefore they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had theunexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt ina tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summerwe have not determined how far it shall carry us said mrs gardinerbut perhaps to the lakesno scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and heracceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful oh my deardear aunt she rapturously cried what delight what felicity yougive me fresh life and vigour adieu to disappointment and spleen whatare young men to rocks and mountains oh what hours of transportwe shall spend and when we do return it shall not be like othertravellers without being able to give one accurate idea of anything wewill know where we have gonewe will recollect what we have seenlakes mountains and rivers shall not be jumbled together in ourimaginations nor when we attempt to describe any particular scenewill we begin quarreling about its relative situation let ourfirst effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality oftravellersevery object in the next days journey was new and interesting toelizabeth and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment for she hadseen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her healthand the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delightwhen they left the high road for the lane to hunsford every eye was insearch of the parsonage and every turning expected to bring it in viewthe palings of rosings park was their boundary on one side elizabethsmiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitantsat length the parsonage was discernible the garden sloping to theroad the house standing in it the green pales and the laurel hedgeeverything declared they were arriving mr collins and charlotteappeared at the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate whichled by a short gravel walk to the house amidst the nods and smiles ofthe whole party in a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicingat the sight of each other mrs collins welcomed her friend with theliveliest pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied withcoming when she found herself so affectionately received she sawinstantly that her cousins manners were not altered by his marriagehis formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her someminutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all herfamily they were then with no other delay than his pointing out theneatness of the entrance taken into the house and as soon as theywere in the parlour he welcomed them a second time with ostentatiousformality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his wifesoffers of refreshmentelizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not helpin fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room itsaspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to heras if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him butthough everything seemed neat and comfortable she was not able togratify him by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder ather friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companionwhen mr collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably beashamed which certainly was not unseldom she involuntarily turned hereye on charlotte once or twice she could discern a faint blush butin general charlotte wisely did not hear after sitting long enough toadmire every article of furniture in the room from the sideboard tothe fender to give an account of their journey and of all that hadhappened in london mr collins invited them to take a stroll in thegarden which was large and well laid out and to the cultivation ofwhich he attended himself to work in this garden was one of his mostrespectable pleasures and elizabeth admired the command of countenancewith which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise andowned she encouraged it as much as possible here leading the waythrough every walk and cross walk and scarcely allowing them aninterval to utter the praises he asked for every view was pointed outwith a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind he could number thefields in every direction and could tell how many trees there were inthe most distant clump but of all the views which his garden or whichthe country or kingdom could boast none were to be compared with theprospect of rosings afforded by an opening in the trees that borderedthe park nearly opposite the front of his house it was a handsomemodern building well situated on rising groundfrom his garden mr collins would
