everybody wasexcited everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happenedand there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellowsstretching their necks and listening  one long lanky man with longhair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head and acrookedhandled cane marked out the places on the ground where boggsstood and where sherburn stood and the people following him around fromone place to tother and watching everything he done and bobbing theirheads to show they understood and stooping a little and resting theirhands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground withhis cane and then he stood up straight and stiff where sherburn hadstood frowning and having his hatbrim down over his eyes and sungout boggs and then fetched his cane down slow to a level and saysbang staggered backwards says bang again and fell down flat onhis back the people that had seen the thing said he done it perfectsaid it was just exactly the way it all happened  then as much as adozen people got out their bottles and treated himwell by and by somebody said sherburn ought to be lynched  in about aminute everybody was saying it so away they went mad and yelling andsnatching down every clothesline they come to to do the hanging withthey swarmed up towards sherburns house awhooping and raging likeinjuns and everything had to clear the way or get run over and trompedto mush and it was awful to see  children was heeling it ahead of themob screaming and trying to get out of the way and every window alongthe road was full of womens heads and there was nigger boys in everytree and bucks and wenches looking over every fence and as soon as themob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out ofreach  lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on scaredmost to deaththey swarmed up in front of sherburns palings as thick as they couldjam together and you couldnt hear yourself think for the noise  itwas a little twentyfoot yard  some sung out tear down the fence teardown the fence  then there was a racket of ripping and tearing andsmashing and down she goes and the front wall of the crowd begins toroll in like a wavejust then sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porchwith a doublebarrel gun in his hand and takes his stand perfectlycam and deliberate not saying a word  the racket stopped and thewave sucked backsherburn never said a wordjust stood there looking down  thestillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable  sherburn run his eye slowalong the crowd and wherever it struck the people tried a little tooutgaze him but they couldnt they dropped their eyes and lookedsneaky then pretty soon sherburn sort of laughed not the pleasantkind but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating breadthats got sand in itthen he says slow and scornfulthe idea of you lynching anybody  its amusing  the idea of youthinking you had pluck enough to lynch a man  because youre braveenough to tar and feather poor friendless castout women that come alonghere did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on aman  why a mans safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kindaslong as its daytime and youre not behind himdo i know you  i know you clear through i was born and raised in thesouth and ive lived in the north so i know the average all aroundthe average mans a coward  in the north he lets anybody walk over himthat wants to and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear itin the south one man all by himself has stopped a stage full of menin the daytime and robbed the lot  your newspapers call you abrave people so much that you think you are braver than any otherpeoplewhereas youre just as brave and no braver  why dont yourjuries hang murderers  because theyre afraid the mans friends willshoot them in the back in the darkand its just what they would doso they always acquit and then a man goes in the night with ahundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal  your mistakeis that you didnt bring a man with you thats one mistake and theother is that you didnt come in the dark and fetch your masks  youbrought part of a manbuck harkness thereand if you hadnt had himto start you youd a taken it out in blowingyou didnt want to come  the average man dont like trouble anddanger you dont like trouble and danger  but if only half amanlike buck harkness thereshouts lynch him lynch him youreafraid to back downafraid youll be found out to be what youarecowardsand so you raise a yell and hang yourselves on to thathalfamans coattail and come raging up here swearing what bigthings youre going to do the pitifulest thing out is a mob thatswhat an army isa mob they dont fight with courage thats born inthem but with courage thats borrowed from their mass and from theirofficers  but a mob without any man at the head of it is beneathpitifulness  now the thing for you to do is to droop your tails andgo home and crawl in a hole  if any real lynchings going to be done itwill be done in the dark southern fashion and when they come theyllbring their masks and fetch a man along  now leaveand take yourhalfaman with youtossing his gun up across his left arm and cockingit when he says thisthe crowd washed back sudden and then broke all apart and went tearingoff every which way and buck harkness he heeled it after them lookingtolerable cheap  i could a stayed if i wanted to but i didnt want toi went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchmanwent by and then dived in under the tent  i had my twentydollar goldpiece and some other money but i reckoned i better save it becausethere aint no telling how soon you are going to need it away fromhome and amongst strangers that way  you cant be too careful  i aintopposed to spending money on circuses when there aint no other way butthere aint no use in wasting it on themit was a real bully circus  it was the splendidest sight that ever waswhen they all come riding in two and two a gentleman and lady sideby side the men just in their drawers and undershirts and no shoesnor stirrups and resting their hands on their thighs easy andcomfortablethere must a been twenty of themand every lady with alovely complexion and perfectly beautiful and looking just like a gangof real sureenough queens and dressed in clothes that cost millions ofdollars and just littered with diamonds  it was a powerful fine sighti never see anything so lovely  and then one by one they got upand stood and went aweaving around the ring so gentle and wavy andgraceful the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight with theirheads bobbing and skimming along away up there under the tentroof andevery ladys roseleafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hipsand she looking like the most loveliest parasoland then faster and faster they went all of them dancing first onefoot out in the air and then the other the horses leaning more andmore and the ringmaster going round and round the centerpole crackinghis whip and shouting hihi and the clown cracking jokes behindhim and by and by all hands dropped the reins and every lady put herknuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms and then howthe horses did lean over and hump themselves  and so one after theother they all skipped off into the ring and made the sweetest bow iever see and then scampered out and everybody clapped their hands andwent just about wildwell all through the circus they done the most astonishing things andall the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people  theringmaster couldnt ever say a word to him but he was back at him quickas a wink with the funniest things a body ever said and how he evercould think of so many of them and so sudden and so pat was what icouldnt noway understand why i couldnt a thought of them in a yearand by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ringsaid he wanted toride said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was  they arguedand tried to keep him out but he wouldnt listen and the whole showcome to a standstill  then the people begun to holler at him and makefun of him and that made him mad and he begun to rip and tear so thatstirred up the people and a lot of men begun to pile down off of thebenches and swarm towards the ring saying knock him down throw himout and one or two women begun to scream  so then the ringmasterhe made a little speech and said he hoped there wouldnt be nodisturbance and if the man would promise he wouldnt make no moretrouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse so everybody laughed and said all right and the man got on the minutehe was on the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort aroundwith two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him and thedrunk man hanging on to his neck and his heels flying in the air everyjump and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughingtill tears rolled down  and at last sure enough all the circus mencould do the horse broke loose and away he went like the very nationround and round the ring with that sot laying down on him and hangingto his neck with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one sideand then tother one on tother side and the people just crazy  itwarnt funny to me though i was all of a tremble to see his danger but pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridleareeling this way and that and the next minute he sprung up anddropped the bridle and stood and the horse agoing like a house afiretoo  he just stood up there asailing around as easy and comfortableas if he warnt ever drunk in his lifeand then he begun to pull off hisclothes and sling them  he shed them so thick they kind of clogged upthe air and altogether he shed seventeen suits and then there hewas slim and handsome and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest youever saw and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairlyhumand finally skipped off and made his bow and danced off tothe dressingroom and everybody just ahowling with pleasure andastonishmentthen the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled and he was thesickest ringmaster you ever see i reckon  why it was one of his ownmen  he had got up that joke all out of his own head and never let onto nobody well i felt sheepish enough to be took in so but i wouldnta been in that ringmasters place not for a thousand dollars  i dontknow there may be bullier circuses than what that one was but inever struck them yet anyways it was plenty good enough for me andwherever i run across it it can have all of my custom every timewell that night we had our show but there warnt only about twelvepeople therejust enough to pay expenses  and they laughed all thetime and that made the duke mad and everybody left anyway beforethe show was over but one boy which was asleep  so the duke said thesearkansaw lunkheads couldnt come up to shakespeare what they wantedwas low comedyand maybe something ruther worse than low comedy hereckoned  he said he could size their style  so next morning he gotsome big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint and drawed offsome handbills and stuck them up all over the village  the bills saidwell all day him and the king was hard at it rigging up a stage anda curtain and a row of candles for footlights and that night the housewas jam full of men in no time  when the place couldnt hold no morethe duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come onto the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speechand praised up this tragedy and said it was the most thrillingest onethat ever was and so he went on abragging about the tragedy and aboutedmund kean the elder which was to play the main principal part in itand at last when hed got everybodys expectations up high enough herolled up the curtain and the next minute the king come aprancingout on all fours naked and he was painted all overringstreakedandstriped all sorts of colors as splendid as arainbow  andbut never mind the rest of his outfit it was just wildbut it was awful funny the people most killed themselves laughing andwhen the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes theyroared and clapped and stormed and hawhawed till he come back and doneit over again and after that they made him do it another time well itwould make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cutthen the duke he lets the curtain down and bows to the people and saysthe great tragedy will be performed only two nights more on accounts ofpressing london engagements where the seats is all sold already for itin drury lane and then he makes them another bow and says if he hassucceeded in pleasing them and instructing them he will be deeplyobleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to comeand see ittwenty people sings outwhat is it over  is that allthe duke says yes  then there was a fine time  everybody singsout sold and rose up mad and was agoing for that stage and themtragedians  but a big fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shoutshold on  just a word gentlemen  they stopped to listen  we aresoldmighty badly sold  but we dont want to be the laughing stock ofthis whole town i reckon and never hear the last of this thing as longas we live  no  what we want is to go out of here quiet and talkthis show up and sell the rest of the town  then well all be in thesame boat  aint that sensible you bet it isthe jedge is right everybody sings out all right thennot a word about any sell  goalong home and advise everybody to come and see the tragedynext day you couldnt hear nothing around that town but how splendidthat show was  house was jammed again that night and we sold thiscrowd the same way  when me and the king and the duke got home to theraft we all had a supper and by and by about midnight they made jimand me back her out and float her down the middle of the river andfetch her in and hide her about two mile below townthe third night the house was crammed againand they warnt newcomersthis time but people that was at the show the other two nights  istood by the duke at the door and i see that every man that went in hadhis pockets bulging or something muffled up under his coatand i see itwarnt no perfumery neither not by a long sight  i smelt sickly eggsby the barrel and rotten cabbages and such things and if i know thesigns of a dead cat being around and i bet i do there was sixtyfourof them went in  i shoved in there for a minute but it was too variousfor me i couldnt stand it  well when the place couldnt hold no morepeople the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend doorfor him a minute and then he started around for the stage door i afterhim but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he sayswalk fast now till you get away from the houses and then shin for theraft like the dickens was after youi done it and he done the same  we struck the raft at the same timeand in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream all dark andstill and edging towards the middle of the river nobody saying aword i reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with theaudience but nothing of the sort pretty soon he crawls out from underthe wigwam and sayswell howd the old thing pan out this time duke  he hadnt beenuptown at allwe never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the villagethen we lit up and had a supper and the king and the duke fairlylaughed their bones loose over the way theyd served them people  theduke saysgreenhorns flatheads  i knew the first house would keep mum and letthe rest of the town get roped in and i knew theyd lay for us thethird night and consider it was their turn now  well it is theirturn and id give something to know how much theyd take for it  iwould just like to know how theyre putting in their opportunity they can turn it into a picnic if they want tothey

head down betwixt his knees moaning and mourning to himself  ididnt take notice nor let on  i knowed what it was about  he wasthinking about his wife and his children away up yonder and he was lowand homesick because he hadnt ever been away from home before in hislife and i do believe he cared just as much for his people as whitefolks does for theirn  it dont seem natural but i reckon its so he

atreatn her sonext day towards night we laid up under a little willow towhead out inthe middle where there was a village on each side of the river and theduke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns  jimhe spoke to the duke and said he hoped it wouldnt take but a fewhours because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had tolay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope  you see when we left himall alone we had to tie him because if anybody happened on to him allby himself and not tied it wouldnt look much like he was a runawaynigger you know so the duke said it was kind of hard to have to layroped all day and hed cipher out some way to get around ithe was uncommon bright the duke was and he soon struck it  he dressedjim up in king lears outfitit was a long curtaincalico gown and awhite horsehair wig and whiskers and then he took his theater paintand painted jims face and hands and ears and neck all over a deaddull solid blue like a man thats been drownded nine days  blamed ifhe warnt the horriblest looking outrage i ever see  then the duke tookand wrote out a sign on a shingle sosick arabbut harmless when not out of his headand he nailed that shingle to a lath and stood the lath up four or fivefoot in front of the wigwam  jim was satisfied  he said it was a sightbetter than lying tied a couple of years every day and trembling allover every time there was a sound  the duke told him to make himselffree and easy and if anybody ever come meddling around he must hopout of the wigwam and carry on a little and fetch a howl or two likea wild beast and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone which was sound enough judgment but you take the average man and hewouldnt wait for him to howl  why he didnt only look like he wasdead he looked considerable more than thatthese rapscallions wanted to try the nonesuch again because there wasso much money in it but they judged it wouldnt be safe because maybethe news might a worked along down by this time  they couldnt hit noproject that suited exactly so at last the duke said he reckoned hedlay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldnt put upsomething on the arkansaw village and the king he allowed he would dropover to tother village without any plan but just trust in providenceto lead him the profitable waymeaning the devil i reckon  we had allbought store clothes where we stopped last and now the king put hisnon and he told me to put mine on  i done it of course  the kingsduds was all black and he did look real swell and starchy  i neverknowed how clothes could change a body before  why before he lookedlike the orneriest old rip that ever was but now when hed take offhis new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile he looked that grandand good and pious that youd say he had walked right out of the arkand maybe was old leviticus himself  jim cleaned up the canoe and igot my paddle ready  there was a big steamboat laying at the shore awayup under the point about three mile above the townbeen there a coupleof hours taking on freight  says the kingseein how im dressed i reckon maybe i better arrive down from stlouis or cincinnati or some other big place  go for the steamboathuckleberry well come down to the village on heri didnt have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride i fetched the shore a half a mile above the village and then wentscooting along the bluff bank in the easy water  pretty soon we come toa nice innocentlooking young country jake setting on a log swabbing thesweat off of his face for it was powerful warm weather and he had acouple of big carpetbags by himrun her nose in shore says the king  i done it  wher you boundfor young manfor the steamboat going to orleansgit aboard says the king  hold on a minute my servant ll hep youwith them bags  jump out and hep the gentleman adolphusmeaning mei seei done so and then we all three started on again  the young chap wasmighty thankful said it was tough work toting his baggage such weatherhe asked the king where he was going and the king told him hed comedown the river and landed at the other village this morning and now hewas going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there  theyoung fellow sayswhen i first see you i says to myself its mr wilks sure and hecome mighty near getting here in time  but then i says again no ireckon it aint him or else he wouldnt be paddling up the river  youaint him are youno my names blodgettelexander blodgettreverend elexanderblodgett i spose i must say as im one o the lords poor servants but still im jist as able to be sorry for mr wilks for not arrivingin time all the same if hes missed anything by itwhich i hope hehasntwell he dont miss any property by it because hell get that allright but hes missed seeing his brother peter diewhich he mayntmind nobody can tell as to thatbut his brother would a give anythingin this world to see him before he died never talked about nothingelse all these three weeks hadnt seen him since they was boystogetherand hadnt ever seen his brother william at allthats the deefand dumb onewilliam aint more than thirty or thirtyfive  peter andgeorge were the only ones that come out here george was the marriedbrother him and his wife both died last year  harvey and williams theonly ones thats left now and as i was saying they havent got herein timedid anybody send em wordoh yes a month or two ago when peter was first took because petersaid then that he sorter felt like he warnt going to get well thistime you see he was pretty old and georges gyirls was too young tobe much company for him except mary jane the redheaded one and so hewas kinder lonesome after george and his wife died and didnt seemto care much to live  he most desperately wanted to see harveyandwilliam too for that matterbecause he was one of them kind that cantbear to make a will  he left a letter behind for harvey and said hedtold in it where his money was hid and how he wanted the rest of theproperty divided up so georges gyirls would be all rightfor georgedidnt leave nothing  and that letter was all they could get him to puta pen towhy do you reckon harvey dont come  wher does he liveoh he lives in englandsheffieldpreaches therehasnt ever been inthis country  he hasnt had any too much timeand besides he mightnt agot the letter at all you knowtoo bad too bad he couldnt a lived to see his brothers poor soulyou going to orleans you sayyes but that aint only a part of it  im going in a ship nextwednesday for ryo janeero where my uncle livesits a pretty long journey  but itll be lovely wisht i was agoingis mary jane the oldest  how old is the othersmary janes nineteen susans fifteen and joannas aboutfourteenthats the one that gives herself to good works and has aharelippoor things to be left alone in the cold world sowell they could be worse off  old peter had friends and theyaint going to let them come to no harm  theres hobson the babtispreacher and deacon lot hovey and ben rucker and abner shacklefordand levi bell the lawyer and dr robinson and their wives and thewidow bartley andwell theres a lot of them but these are the onesthat peter was thickest with and used to write about sometimes whenhe wrote home so harvey ll know where to look for friends when he getsherewell the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptiedthat young fellow  blamed if he didnt inquire about everybody andeverything in that blessed town and all about the wilkses and aboutpeters businesswhich was a tanner and about georgeswhich was acarpenter and about harveyswhich was a dissentering minister and soon and so on  then he sayswhat did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat forbecause shes a big orleans boat and i was afeard she mightnt stopthere  when theyre deep they wont stop for a hail  a cincinnati boatwill but this is a st louis onewas peter wilks well offoh yes pretty well off  he had houses and land and its reckoned heleft three or four thousand in cash hid up somerswhen did you say he diedi didnt say but it was last nightfuneral tomorrow likelyyes bout the middle of the daywell its all terrible sad but weve all got to go one time oranother so what we want to do is to be prepared then were all rightyes sir its the best way  ma used to always say thatwhen we struck the boat she was about done loading and pretty soon shegot off  the king never said nothing about going aboard so i lostmy ride after all  when the boat was gone the king made me paddle upanother mile to a lonesome place and then he got ashore and saysnow hustle back right off and fetch the duke up here and the newcarpetbags  and if hes gone over to tother side go over there andgit him  and tell him to git himself up regardless  shove along nowi see what he was up to but i never said nothing of course  wheni got back with the duke we hid the canoe and then they set down on alog and the king told him everything just like the young fellow hadsaid itevery last word of it  and all the time he was adoing it hetried to talk like an englishman and he done it pretty well too fora slouch i cant imitate him and so i aint agoing to try to but hereally done it pretty good  then he sayshow are you on the deef and dumb bilgewaterthe duke said leave him alone for that said he had played a deefand dumb person on the histronic boards  so then they waited for asteamboatabout the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come alongbut they didnt come from high enough up the river but at last therewas a big one and they hailed her  she sent out her yawl and we wentaboard and she was from cincinnati and when they found we only wantedto go four or five mile they was booming mad and gave us a cussing andsaid they wouldnt land us  but the king was cam  he saysif gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on andput off in a yawl a steamboat kin afford to carry em cant itso they softened down and said it was all right and when we got to thevillage they yawled us ashore  about two dozen men flocked down whenthey see the yawl acoming and when the king sayskin any of you gentlemen tell me wher mr peter wilks lives theygive a glance at one another and nodded their heads as much as to saywhat d i tell you  then one of them says kind of soft and gentleim sorry sir but the best we can do is to tell you where he didlive yesterday eveningsudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash and fell upagainst the man and put his chin on his shoulder and cried down hisback and saysalas alas our poor brothergone and we never got to see him ohits too too hardthen he turns around blubbering and makes a lot of idiotic signs tothe duke on his hands and blamed if he didnt drop a carpetbag andbust out acrying  if they warnt the beatenest lot them two fraudsthat ever i struckwell the men gathered around and sympathized with them and said allsorts of kind things to them and carried their carpetbags up the hillfor them and let them lean on them and cry and told the king all abouthis brothers last moments and the king he told it all over again onhis hands to the duke and both of them took on about that dead tannerlike theyd lost the twelve disciples  well if ever i struck anythinglike it im a nigger it was enough to make a body ashamed of the humanracethe news was all over town in two minutes and you could see the peopletearing down on the run from every which way some of them putting ontheir coats as they come  pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowdand the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march  the windows anddooryards was full and every minute somebody would say over a fenceis it themand somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and sayyou bet it iswhen we got to the house the street in front of it was packed and thethree girls was standing in the door  mary jane was redheaded butthat dont make no difference she was most awful beautiful and herface and her eyes was all lit up like glory she was so glad her uncleswas come the king he spread his arms and mary jane she jumped forthem and the harelip jumped for the duke and there they had it everybody most leastways women cried for joy to see them meet againat last and have such good timesthen the king he hunched the duke privatei see him do itand then helooked around and see the coffin over in the corner on two chairs sothen him and the duke with a hand across each others shoulder andtother hand to their eyes walked slow and solemn over there everybodydropping back to give them room and all the talk and noise stoppingpeople saying sh and all the men taking their hats off and droopingtheir heads so you could a heard a pin fall  and when they got therethey bent over and looked in the coffin and took one sight and thenthey bust out acrying so you could a heard them to orleans most andthen they put their arms around each others necks and hung their chinsover each others shoulders and then for three minutes or maybe fouri never see two men leak the way they done  and mind you everybodywas doing the same and the place was that damp i never see anythinglike it then one of them got on one side of the coffin and tother ontother side and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on thecoffin and let on to pray all to themselves  well when it cometo that it worked the crowd like you never see anything like it andeverybody broke down and went to sobbing right out loudthe poor girlstoo and every woman nearly went up to the girls without saying aword and kissed them solemn on the forehead and then put their handon their head and looked up towards the sky with the tears runningdown and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing and givethe next woman a show  i never see anything so disgustingwell by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little andworks himself up and slobbers out a speech all full of tears andflapdoodle about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brotherto lose the diseased and to miss seeing diseased alive after the longjourney of four thousand mile but its a trial thats sweetened andsanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears and so hethanks them out of his heart and out of his brothers heart because outof their mouths they cant words being too weak and cold and all thatkind of rot and slush till it was just sickening and then he blubbersout a pious goodygoody amen and turns himself loose and goes to cryingfit to bustand the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in thecrowd struck up the doxolojer and everybody joined in with all theirmight and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as churchletting out music is a good thing and after all that soulbutter andhogwash i never see it freshen up things so and sound so honest andbullythen the king begins to work his jaw again and says how him and hisnieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of thefamily would take supper here with them this evening and help set upwith the ashes of the diseased and says if his poor brother layingyonder could speak he knows who he would name for they was names thatwas very dear to him and mentioned often in his letters and so he willname the same to wit as follows vizzrev mr hobson and deaconlot hovey and mr ben rucker and abner shackleford and levi bell anddr robinson and their wives and the widow bartleyrev hobson and dr robinson was down to the end of the town ahuntingtogetherthat is i mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to totherworld and the preacher was pinting him right  lawyer bell was away upto louisville on business  but the rest was on hand and so they allcome and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to himand then they shook hands with the duke and didnt say nothing but justkept asmiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads whilsthe made all sorts of signs with his hands and said googoogoogoogoo all the time like a baby that cant talkso the king he blattered along and managed to inquire about prettymuch everybody and dog in town by his name and mentioned all sortsof little things that happened one time or another in the town or togeorges family or to peter  and he always let on that peter wrote himthe things but that was a lie  he got every blessed one of them out ofthat young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboatthen mary jane she fetched the letter her father left behind and theking he read it out loud and cried over it  it give
