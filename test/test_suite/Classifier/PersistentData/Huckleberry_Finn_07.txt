is a girl that im letting that old reptile robher of her moneythen susan she waltzed in and if youll believe me she did giveharelip hark from the tombsays i to myself and this is another one that im letting him rob herof her moneythen mary jane she took another inning and went in sweet and lovelyagainwhich was her way but when she got done there warnt hardlyanything left o poor harelip  so she holleredall right then says the other girls you just ask his pardonshe done it too and she done it beautiful  she done it so beautifulit was good to hear and i wished i could tell her a thousand lies soshe could do it againi says to myself this is another one that im letting him rob her ofher money  and when she got through they all jest laid theirselvesout to make me feel at home and know i was amongst friends  i felt soornery and low down and mean that i says to myself my minds made upill hive that money for them or bustso then i lit outfor bed i said meaning some time or another  wheni got by myself i went to thinking the thing over  i says to myselfshall i go to that doctor private and blow on these frauds  nothatwont do he might tell who told him then the king and the duke wouldmake it warm for me  shall i go private and tell mary jane  noidasnt do it her face would give them a hint sure theyve got themoney and theyd slide right out and get away with it  if she was tofetch in help id get mixed up in the business before it was done withi judge  no there aint no good way but one  i got to steal thatmoney somehow and i got to steal it some way that they wont suspicionthat i done it theyve got a good thing here and they aint agoingto leave till theyve played this family and this town for all theyreworth so ill find a chance time enough ill steal it and hide it andby and by when im away down the river ill write a letter and tellmary jane where its hid  but i better hive it tonight if i canbecause the doctor maybe hasnt let up as much as he lets on he has hemight scare them out of here yetso thinks i ill go and search them rooms  upstairs the hall wasdark but i found the dukes room and started to paw around it withmy hands but i recollected it wouldnt be much like the king to letanybody else take care of that money but his own self so then i went tohis room and begun to paw around there  but i see i couldnt do nothingwithout a candle and i dasnt light one of course  so i judged idgot to do the other thinglay for them and eavesdrop  about that timei hears their footsteps coming and was going to skip under the bed ireached for it but it wasnt where i thought it would be but i touchedthe curtain that hid mary janes frocks so i jumped in behind that andsnuggled in amongst the gowns and stood there perfectly stillthey come in and shut the door and the first thing the duke done was toget down and look under the bed  then i was glad i hadnt found the bedwhen i wanted it  and yet you know its kind of natural to hide underthe bed when you are up to anything private  they sets down then andthe king sayswell what is it  and cut it middlin short because its better forus to be down there awhoopin up the mournin than up here givin em achance to talk us overwell this is it capet  i aint easy i aint comfortable  thatdoctor lays on my mind  i wanted to know your plans  ive got anotion and i think its a sound onewhat is it dukethat we better glide out of this before three in the morning and clipit down the river with what weve got  specially seeing we got it soeasygiven back to us flung at our heads as you may say when ofcourse we allowed to have to steal it back  im for knocking off andlighting outthat made me feel pretty bad  about an hour or two ago it would a beena little different but now it made me feel bad and disappointed theking rips out and sayswhat  and not sell out the rest o the property  march off likea passel of fools and leave eight or nine thousn dollars worth oproperty layin around jest sufferin to be scooped inand all goodsalable stuff toothe duke he grumbled said the bag of gold was enough and he didntwant to go no deeperdidnt want to rob a lot of orphans of everythingthey hadwhy how you talk says the king  we shant rob em of nothing atall but jest this money  the people that buys the property is thesuffrers because as soon s its found out at we didnt own itwhichwont be long after weve slidthe sale wont be valid and it ll allgo back to the estate  these yer orphans ll git their house back aginand thats enough for them theyre young and spry and kn easyearn a livin  they aint agoin to suffer  why jest thinktheresthousns and thousns that aint nigh so well off  bless you theyaint got nothn to complain ofwell the king he talked him blind so at last he give in and said allright but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay and thatdoctor hanging over them  but the king sayscuss the doctor  what do we kyer for him  haint we got all thefools in town on our side  and aint that a big enough majority in anytownso they got ready to go down stairs again  the duke saysi dont think we put that money in a good placethat cheered me up  id begun to think i warnt going to get a hint ofno kind to help me  the king sayswhybecause mary jane ll be in mourning from this out and first you knowthe nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these dudsup and put em away and do you reckon a nigger can run across money andnot borrow some of ityour heads level agin duke says the king and he comes afumblingunder the curtain two or three foot from where i was  i stuck tight tothe wall and kept mighty still though quivery and i wondered what themfellows would say to me if they catched me and i tried to think whatid better do if they did catch me  but the king he got the bag beforei could think more than about a half a thought and he never suspicionedi was around  they took and shoved the bag through a rip in the strawtick that was under the featherbed and crammed it in a foot or twoamongst the straw and said it was all right now because a nigger onlymakes up the featherbed and dont turn over the straw tick only abouttwice a year and so it warnt in no danger of getting stole nowbut i knowed better  i had it out of there before they was halfwaydown stairs  i groped along up to my cubby and hid it there till icould get a chance to do better  i judged i better hide it outsideof the house somewheres because if they missed it they would give thehouse a good ransacking  i knowed that very well  then i turned inwith my clothes all on but i couldnt a gone to sleep if id a wantedto i was in such a sweat to get through with the business  by and by iheard the king and the duke come up so i rolled off my pallet and laidwith my chin at the top of my ladder and waited to see if anything wasgoing to happen  but nothing didso i held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadntbegun yet and then i slipped down the ladderi crept to their doors and listened they was snoring  so i tiptoedalong and got down stairs all right  there warnt a sound anywheres i peeped through a crack of the diningroom door and see the men thatwas watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs  the doorwas open into the parlor where the corpse was laying and there was acandle in both rooms i passed along and the parlor door was open buti see there warnt nobody in there but the remainders of peter so ishoved on by but the front door was locked and the key wasnt there just then i heard somebody coming down the stairs back behind me  irun in the parlor and took a swift look around and the only place isee to hide the bag was in the coffin  the lid was shoved along abouta foot showing the dead mans face down in there with a wet cloth overit and his shroud on  i tucked the moneybag in under the lid justdown beyond where his hands was crossed which made me creep they wasso cold and then i run back across the room and in behind the doorthe person coming was mary jane  she went to the coffin very soft andkneeled down and looked in then she put up her handkerchief and i seeshe begun to cry though i couldnt hear her and her back was to me  islid out and as i passed the diningroom i thought id make sure themwatchers hadnt seen me so i looked through the crack and everythingwas all right  they hadnt stirredi slipped up to bed feeling ruther blue on accounts of the thingplaying out that way after i had took so much trouble and run so muchresk about it  says i if it could stay where it is all right becausewhen we get down the river a hundred mile or two i could write back tomary jane and she could dig him up again and get it but that aint thething thats going to happen the thing thats going to happen is themoney ll be found when they come to screw on the lid  then the kingll get it again and it ll be a long day before he gives anybodyanother chance to smouch it from him of course i wanted to slidedown and get it out of there but i dasnt try it  every minute it wasgetting earlier now and pretty soon some of them watchers would beginto stir and i might get catchedcatched with six thousand dollars in myhands that nobody hadnt hired me to take care of  i dont wish to bemixed up in no such business as that i says to myselfwhen i got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up and thewatchers was gone  there warnt nobody around but the family and thewidow bartley and our tribe  i watched their faces to see if anythinghad been happening but i couldnt telltowards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man and theyset the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs and thenset all our chairs in rows and borrowed more from the neighbors tillthe hall and the parlor and the diningroom was full  i see the coffinlid was the way it was before but i dasnt go to look in under it withfolks aroundthen the people begun to flock in and the beats and the girls tookseats in the front row at the head of the coffin and for a half an hourthe people filed around slow in single rank and looked down at thedead mans face a minute and some dropped in a tear and it wasall very still and solemn only the girls and the beats holdinghandkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent and sobbing alittle  there warnt no other sound but the scraping of the feet onthe floor and blowing nosesbecause people always blows them more at afuneral than they do at other places except churchwhen the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in hisblack gloves with his softy soothering ways putting on the lasttouches and getting people and things all shipshape and comfortableand making no more sound than a cat  he never spoke he moved peoplearound he squeezed in late ones he opened up passageways and doneit with nods and signs with his hands  then he took his place overagainst the wall he was the softest glidingest stealthiest man i eversee and there warnt no more smile to him than there is to a hamthey had borrowed a melodeuma sick one and when everything was readya young woman set down and worked it and it was pretty skreeky andcolicky and everybody joined in and sung and peter was the only onethat had a good thing according to my notion  then the reverend hobsonopened up slow and solemn and begun to talk and straight off the mostoutrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard it was onlyone dog but he made a most powerful racket and he kept it up rightalong the parson he had to stand there over the coffin and waityoucouldnt hear yourself think  it was right down awkward and nobodydidnt seem to know what to do  but pretty soon they see thatlonglegged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to saydont you worryjust depend on me  then he stooped down and begunto glide along the wall just his shoulders showing over the peoplesheads  so he glided along and the powwow and racket getting more andmore outrageous all the time and at last when he had gone around twosides of the room he disappears down cellar  then in about two secondswe heard a whack and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl ortwo and then everything was dead still and the parson begun his solemntalk where he left off  in a minute or two here comes this undertakersback and shoulders gliding along the wall again and so he glided andglided around three sides of the room and then rose up and shaded hismouth with his hands and stretched his neck out towards the preacherover the peoples heads and says in a kind of a coarse whisper hehad a rat  then he drooped down and glided along the wall again tohis place  you could see it was a great satisfaction to the peoplebecause naturally they wanted to know  a little thing like that dontcost nothing and its just the little things that makes a man to belooked up to and liked  there warnt no more popular man in town thanwhat that undertaker waswell the funeral sermon was very good but pison long and tiresome andthen the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage andat last the job was through and the undertaker begun to sneak up on thecoffin with his screwdriver  i was in a sweat then and watched himpretty keen but he never meddled at all just slid the lid along assoft as mush and screwed it down tight and fast  so there i was  ididnt know whether the money was in there or not  so says i sposesomebody has hogged that bag on the slynow how do i know whetherto write to mary jane or not spose she dug him up and didnt findnothing what would she think of me blame it i says i might gethunted up and jailed id better lay low and keep dark and not write atall the things awful mixed now trying to better it ive worsened ita hundred times and i wish to goodness id just let it alone dad fetchthe whole businessthey buried him and we come back home and i went to watching facesagaini couldnt help it and i couldnt rest easy  but nothing come ofit the faces didnt tell me nothingthe king he visited around in the evening and sweetened everybody upand made himself ever so friendly and he give out the idea that hiscongregation over in england would be in a sweat about him so he musthurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home  he wasvery sorry he was so pushed and so was everybody they wished he couldstay longer but they said they could see it couldnt be done  and hesaid of course him and william would take the girls home with them andthat pleased everybody too because then the girls would be well fixedand amongst their own relations and it pleased the girls tootickledthem so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world and toldhim to sell out as quick as he wanted to they would be ready  thempoor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see themgetting fooled and lied to so but i didnt see no safe way for me tochip in and change the general tunewell blamed if the king didnt bill the house and the niggers and allthe property for auction straight offsale two days after the funeralbut anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted toso the next day after the funeral along about noontime the girls joygot the first jolt  a couple of nigger traders come along and the kingsold them the niggers reasonable for threeday drafts as they calledit and away they went the two sons up the river to memphis and theirmother down the river to orleans  i thought them poor girls and themniggers would break their hearts for grief they cried around eachother and took on so it most made me down sick to see it  the girlssaid they hadnt ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or soldaway from the town  i cant ever get it out of my memory the sight ofthem poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each others necksand crying and i reckon i couldnt a stood it all but would a hadto bust out and tell on our gang if i hadnt knowed the sale warnt noaccount and the niggers would be back home in a week or twothe thing made a big stir in the town too and a good many come outflatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and thechildren that way  it injured the frauds some but the old fool hebulled right along spite of all the duke could say or do and i tellyou the duke was powerful uneasynext day was auction day  about broad day in the morning the king andthe duke come up in the garret and woke me up and i see by their lookthat there was trouble  the king sayswas you in my room night before lastno your majestywhich was the way i always called him when nobody butour gang warnt aroundwas you in there yisterday er last nightno your majestyhonor bright nowno lieshonor bright your majesty im telling you the truth  i haint beenanear your room since miss mary jane took you and the duke and showedit to youthe duke sayshave you seen anybody else go in thereno your grace not as i remember i believestop and thinki studied awhile and see my chance then i sayswell i see the niggers go in there several timesboth of them gave a little jump and looked like they hadnt everexpected it and then like they had  then the duke sayswhat all of themnoleastways not all at oncethat is i dont think i ever see themall come out at once but just one timehello  when was thatit was the day we had the funeral  in the morning  it warnt earlybecause i overslept  i was just starting down the ladder and i seethemwell go on go on  what did they do  howd they actthey didnt do nothing  and they didnt act anyway much as fur as isee they tiptoed away so i seen easy enough that theyd shoved inthere to do up your majestys room or something sposing you was upand found you warnt up and so they was hoping to slide out of theway of trouble without waking you up if they hadnt already waked youupgreat guns this is a go says the king and both of them lookedpretty sick and tolerable silly  they stood there athinking andscratching their heads a minute and the duke he bust into a kind of alittle raspy chuckle and saysit does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand  they let onto be sorry they was going out of this region  and i believed theywas sorry and so did you and so did everybody  dont ever tell meany more that a nigger aint got any histrionic talent  why the waythey played that thing it would fool anybody  in my opinion theresa fortune in em  if i had capital and a theater i wouldnt want abetter layout than thatand here weve gone and sold em for a song yes and aint privileged to sing the song yet  say where is thatsongthat draftin the bank for to be collected  where would it bewell thats all right then thank goodnesssays i kind of timidlikeis something gone wrongthe king whirls on me and rips outnone o your business  you keep your head shet and mind yr ownaffairsif you got any  long as youre in this town dont you forgitthatyou hear  then he says to the duke we got to jest swaller itand say nothn  mums the word for usas they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again andsaysquick sales and small profits  its a good businessyesthe king snarls around on him and saysi was trying to do for the best in sellin em out so quick  if theprofits has turned out to be none lackin considable and none tocarry is it my fault any moren its yournwell theyd be in this house yet and we wouldnt if i could a gotmy advice listened tothe king sassed back as much as was safe for him and then swappedaround and lit into me again  he give me down the banks for notcoming and telling him i see the niggers come out of his room actingthat waysaid any fool would a knowed something was up  and thenwaltzed in and cussed himself awhile and said it all come of him notlaying late and taking his natural rest that morning and hed beblamed if hed ever do it again  so they went off ajawing and i feltdreadful glad id worked it all off on to the niggers and yet hadntdone the niggers no harm by itby and by it was gettingup time  so i come down the ladder and startedfor downstairs but as i come to the girls room the door was open andi see mary jane setting by her old hair trunk which was open and shedbeen packing things in itgetting ready to go to england  but shehad stopped now with a folded gown in her lap and had her face in herhands crying  i felt awful bad to see it of course anybody would  iwent in there and saysmiss mary jane you cant abear to see people in trouble and icantmost always  tell me about itso she done it  and it was the niggersi just expected it  she saidthe beautiful trip to england was most about spoiled for her she didntknow how she was ever going to be happy there knowing the mother andthe children warnt ever going to see each other no moreand then bustedout bitterer than ever and flung up her hands and saysoh dear dear to think they aint ever going to see each other anymorebut they willand inside of two weeksand i know it says ilaws it was out before i could think  and before i could budge shethrows her arms around my neck and told me to say it again say itagain say it againi see i had spoke too sudden and said too much and was in a closeplace i asked her to let me think a minute and she set there veryimpatient and excited and handsome but looking kind of happy andeasedup like a person thats had a tooth pulled out  so i went tostudying it out  i says to myself i reckon a body that ups and tellsthe truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resksthough i aint had no experience and cant say for certain but itlooks so to me anyway and yet heres a case where im blest if itdont look to me like the truth is better and actuly safer than a lie i must lay it by in my mind and think it over some time or other itsso kind of strange and unregular i never see nothing like it  well isays to myself at last im agoing to chance it ill up and tell thetruth this time though it does seem most like setting down on a kag ofpowder and touching it off just to see where youll go to

be uneasy about heryes miss mary jane she wanted you to do that  she says tell them togive uncle harvey and william my love and a kiss and say ive run overthe river to see mrmrwhat is the name of that rich family youruncle peter used to think so much ofi mean the one thatwhy you must mean the apthorps aint itof course bother them kind of names a body cant ever seem toremember them half the time somehow  yes she said say she has runover for to ask the apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buythis house because she allowed her uncle peter would ruther they hadit than anybody else and shes going to stick to them till they saytheyll come and then if she aint too tired shes coming home andif she is shell be home in the morning anyway  she said dont saynothing about the proctors but only about the apthorpswhich ll beperfectly true because she is going there to speak about their buyingthe house i know it because she told me so herselfall right they said and cleared out to lay for their uncles andgive them the love and the kisses and tell them the messageeverything was all right now  the girls wouldnt say nothing becausethey wanted to go to england and the king and the duke would ruthermary jane was off working for the auction than around in reach ofdoctor robinson  i felt very good i judged i had done it pretty neatireckoned tom sawyer couldnt a done it no neater himself  of course hewould a throwed more style into it but i cant do that very handy notbeing brung up to itwell they held the auction in the public square along towards the endof the afternoon and it strung along and strung along and the old manhe was on hand and looking his level pisonest up there longside of theauctioneer and chipping in a little scripture now and then or a littlegoodygoody saying of some kind and the duke he was around googooingfor sympathy all he knowed how and just spreading himself generlybut by and by the thing dragged through and everything wassoldeverything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard  sotheyd got to work that offi never see such a girafft as the king wasfor wanting to swallow everything  well whilst they was at it asteamboat landed and in about two minutes up comes a crowd awhoopingand yelling and laughing and carrying on and singing outheres your opposition line heres your two sets o heirs to oldpeter wilksand you pays your money and you takes your choicethey was fetching a very nicelooking old gentleman along and anicelooking younger one with his right arm in a sling  and my soulshow the people yelled and laughed and kept it up  but i didnt see nojoke about it and i judged it would strain the duke and the king someto see any  i reckoned theyd turn pale  but no nary a pale didthey turn the duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up butjust went a googooing around happy and satisfied like a jug thatsgoogling out buttermilk and as for the king he just gazed and gazeddown sorrowful on them newcomers like it give him the stomachache inhis very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in theworld  oh he done it admirable  lots of the principal peoplegethered around the king to let him see they was on his side  that oldgentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death  prettysoon he begun to speak and i see straight off he pronounced like anenglishmannot the kings way though the kings was pretty good foran imitation  i cant give the old gents words nor i cant imitatehim but he turned around to the crowd and says about like thisthis is a surprise to me which i wasnt looking for and illacknowledge candid and frank i aint very well fixed to meet it andanswer it for my brother and me has had misfortunes hes broke hisarm and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in thenight by a mistake  i am peter wilks brother harvey and this is hisbrother william which cant hear nor speakand cant even make signs toamount to much nowt hes only got one hand to work them with  we arewho we say we are and in a day or two when i get the baggage i canprove it but up till then i wont say nothing more but go to the hoteland waitso him and the new dummy started off and the king he laughs andblethers outbroke his armvery likely aint itand very convenient toofor a fraud thats got to make signs and aint learnt how  losttheir baggage thats mighty goodand mighty ingeniousunder thecircumstancesso he laughed again and so did everybody else except three or fouror maybe half a dozen  one of these was that doctor another one wasa sharplooking gentleman with a carpetbag of the oldfashioned kindmade out of carpetstuff that had just come off of the steamboat andwas talking to him in a low voice and glancing towards the king now andthen and nodding their headsit was levi bell the lawyer that was goneup to louisville and another one was a big rough husky that come alongand listened to all the old gentleman said and was listening to theking now and when the king got done this husky up and sayssay looky here if you are harvey wilks whend you come to thistownthe day before the funeral friend says the kingbut what time o dayin the eveninbout an hour er two before sundownhowd you comei come down on the susan powell from cincinnatiwell then howd you come to be up at the pint in the morninin acanoei warnt up at the pint in the morninits a lieseveral of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to anold man and a preacherpreacher be hanged hes a fraud and a liar  he was up at the pintthat mornin  i live up there dont i  well i was up there andhe was up there  i see him there  he come in a canoe along with timcollins and a boythe doctor he up and sayswould you know the boy again if you was to see him hinesi reckon i would but i dont know  why yonder he is now  i knowhim perfectly easyit was me he pointed at  the doctor saysneighbors i dont know whether the new couple is frauds or not but ifthese two aint frauds i am an idiot thats all  i think its ourduty to see that they dont get away from here till weve looked intothis thing come along hines come along the rest of you  well takethese fellows to the tavern and affront them with tother couple and ireckon well find out something before we get throughit was nuts for the crowd though maybe not for the kings friends sowe all started  it was about sundown  the doctor he led me along bythe hand and was plenty kind enough but he never let go my handwe all got in a big room in the hotel and lit up some candles andfetched in the new couple  first the doctor saysi dont wish to be too hard on these two men but i think theyrefrauds and they may have complices that we dont know nothing about if they have wont the complices get away with that bag of gold peterwilks left  it aint unlikely  if these men aint frauds they wontobject to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they provetheyre all rightaint that soeverybody agreed to that  so i judged they had our gang in a prettytight place right at the outstart  but the king he only lookedsorrowful and saysgentlemen i wish the money was there for i aint got no dispositionto throw anything in the way of a fair open outandout investigationo this misable business but alas the money aint there you kn sendand see if you want towhere is it thenwell when my niece give it to me to keep for her i took and hid itinside o the straw tick o my bed not wishin to bank it for the fewdays wed be here and considerin the bed a safe place we not beinused to niggers and supposn em honest like servants in england the niggers stole it the very next mornin after i had went downstairs and when i sold em i hadnt missed the money yit so they gotclean away with it  my servant here kn tell you bout it gentlementhe doctor and several said shucks and i see nobody didnt altogetherbelieve him  one man asked me if i see the niggers steal it  i saidno but i see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away and inever thought nothing only i reckoned they was afraid they had waked upmy master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them that was all they asked me  then the doctor whirls on me and saysare you english tooi says yes and him and some others laughed and said stuffwell then they sailed in on the general investigation and there we hadit up and down hour in hour out and nobody never said a word aboutsupper nor ever seemed to think about itand so they kept it up andkept it up and it was the worst mixedup thing you ever see  theymade the king tell his yarn and they made the old gentleman tell hisnand anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a seen that theold gentleman was spinning truth and tother one lies  and by and bythey had me up to tell what i knowed  the king he give me a lefthandedlook out of the corner of his eye and so i knowed enough to talk on theright side  i begun to tell about sheffield and how we lived thereand all about the english wilkses and so on but i didnt get prettyfur till the doctor begun to laugh and levi bell the lawyer saysset down my boy i wouldnt strain myself if i was you  i reckonyou aint used to lying it dont seem to come handy what you want ispractice  you do it pretty awkwardi didnt care nothing for the compliment but i was glad to be let offanywaythe doctor he started to say something and turns and saysif youd been in town at first levi bell the king broke in andreached out his hand and sayswhy is this my poor dead brothers old friend that hes wrote so oftenaboutthe lawyer and him shook hands and the lawyer smiled and lookedpleased and they talked right along awhile and then got to one sideand talked low and at last the lawyer speaks up and saysthat ll fix it  ill take the order and send it along with yourbrothers and then theyll know its all rightso they got some paper and a pen and the king he set down and twistedhis head to one side and chawed his tongue and scrawled off somethingand then they give the pen to the dukeand then for the first time theduke looked sick  but he took the pen and wrote  so then the lawyerturns to the new old gentleman and saysyou and your brother please write a line or two and sign your namesthe old gentleman wrote but nobody couldnt read it  the lawyer lookedpowerful astonished and sayswell it beats meand snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocketand examined them and then examined the old mans writing and thenthem again and then says  these old letters is from harvey wilksand heres these two handwritings and anybody can see they didntwrite them the king and the duke looked sold and foolish i tellyou to see how the lawyer had took them in and heres this oldgentlemans hand writing and anybody can tell easy enough he didntwrite themfact is the scratches he makes aint properly writing atall  now heres some letters fromthe new old gentleman saysif you please let me explain  nobody can read my hand but my brotherthereso he copies for me  its his hand youve got there not minewell says the lawyer this is a state of things  ive got someof williams letters too so if youll get him to write a line or so wecan comhe cant write with his left hand says the old gentleman  if hecould use his right hand you would see that he wrote his own lettersand mine too  look at both pleasetheyre by the same handthe lawyer done it and saysi believe its soand if it aint so theres a heap strongerresemblance than id noticed before anyway  well well well  ithought we was right on the track of a solution but its gone to grasspartly  but anyway one thing is provedthese two aint either of emwilksesand he wagged his head towards the king and the dukewell what do you think  that muleheaded old fool wouldnt give inthen indeed he wouldnt  said it warnt no fair test  said hisbrother william was the cussedest joker in the world and hadnt triedto writehe see william was going to play one of his jokes the minutehe put the pen to paper  and so he warmed up and went warbling andwarbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he wassaying himself but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in and saysive thought of something  is there anybody here that helped to layout my brhelped to lay out the late peter wilks for buryingyes says somebody me and ab turner done it  were both herethen the old man turns towards the king and saysperhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breastblamed if the king didnt have to brace up mighty quick or hed asqushed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under it tookhim so sudden and mind you it was a thing that was calculated to makemost anybody sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without anynotice because how was he going to know what was tattooed on the man he whitened a little he couldnt help it and it was mighty still inthere and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him  saysi to myself now hell throw up the spongethere aint no more use well did he  a body cant hardly believe it but he didnt  i reckonhe thought hed keep the thing up till he tired them people out sotheyd thin out and him and the duke could break loose and get away anyway he set there and pretty soon he begun to smile and saysmf  its a very tough question aint it  yes sir i kntell you whats tattooed on his breast  its jest a small thin bluearrowthats what it is and if you dont look clost you cant see it now what do you sayheywell i never see anything like that old blister for clean outandoutcheekthe new old gentleman turns brisk towards ab turner and his pard andhis eye lights up like he judged hed got the king this time andsaysthereyouve heard what he said  was there any such mark on peterwilks breastboth of them spoke up and sayswe didnt see no such markgood says the old gentleman  now what you did see on his breastwas a small dim p and a b which is an initial he dropped when he wasyoung and a w with dashes between them so  pbwand he markedthem that way on a piece of paper  come aint that what you sawboth of them spoke up again and saysno we didnt  we never seen any marks at allwell everybody was in a state of mind now and they sings outthe whole bilin of m s frauds  les duck em les drown emles ride em on a rail and everybody was whooping at once and therewas a rattling powwow  but the lawyer he jumps on the table and yellsand saysgentlemengentlemen  hear me just a wordjust a single wordif youplease  theres one way yetlets go and dig up the corpse and lookthat took themhooray they all shouted and was starting right off but the lawyerand the doctor sung outhold on hold on  collar all these four men and the boy and fetchthem along toowell do it they all shouted and if we dont find them marks welllynch the whole gangi was scared now i tell you  but there warnt no getting away youknow they gripped us all and marched us right along straight for thegraveyard which was a mile and a half down the river and the wholetown at our heels for we made noise enough and it was only nine in theeveningas we went by our house i wished i hadnt sent mary jane out of townbecause now if i could tip her the wink shed light out and save me andblow on our deadbeatswell we swarmed along down the river road just carrying on likewildcats and to make it more scary the sky was darking up and thelightning beginning to wink and flitter and the wind to shiver amongstthe leaves this was the most awful trouble and most dangersome i everwas in and i was kinder stunned everything was going so different fromwhat i had allowed for stead of being fixed so i could take my own timeif i wanted to and see all the fun and have mary jane at my back tosave me and set me free when the closefit come here was nothing in theworld betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoomarks  if theydidnt find themi couldnt bear to think about it and yet somehow i couldnt thinkabout nothing else  it got darker and darker and it was a beautifultime to give the crowd the slip but that big husky had me by thewristhinesand a body might as well try to give goliar the slip  hedragged me right along he was so excited and i had to run to keep upwhen they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over itlike an overflow  and when they got to the grave they found they hadabout a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted but nobody hadntthought to fetch a lantern  but they sailed into digging anyway by theflicker of the lightning and sent a man to the nearest house a half amile off to borrow oneso they dug and dug like everything and it got awful dark and the rainstarted and the wind swished and swushed along and the lightning comebrisker and brisker and the thunder boomed but them people never tookno notice of it they was so full of this business and one minuteyou could see everything and every face in that big crowd and theshovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave and the next second thedark wiped it all out and you couldnt see nothing at allat last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid and thensuch another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was toscrouge in and get a sight you never see and in the dark that way itwas awful  hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging soand i reckon he clean forgot i was in the world he was so excited andpantingall of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glareand somebody sings outby the living jingo heres the bag of gold on his breasthines let out a whoop like everybody else and dropped my wrist andgive a big surge to bust his way in and get a look and the way i litout and shinned for the road in the dark there aint nobody can telli had the road all to myself and i fairly flewleastways i had it allto myself except the solid dark and the nowandthen glares and thebuzzing of the rain and the thrashing of the wind and the splitting ofthe thunder and sure as you are born i did clip it alongwhen i struck the town i see there warnt nobody out in the storm soi never hunted for no back streets but humped it straight through themain one and when i begun to get towards our house i aimed my eye andset it no light there the house all darkwhich made me feel sorry anddisappointed i didnt know why  but at last just as i was sailing byflash comes the light in mary janes window and my heart swelled upsudden like to bust and the same second the house and all was behindme in the dark and wasnt ever going to be before me no more in thisworld she was the best girl i ever see and had the most sandthe minute i was
