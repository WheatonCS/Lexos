of his feeling a seriousattachment i had often seen him in love before at that ball while ihad the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sirwilliam lucass accidental information that bingleys attentions toyour sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriagehe spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone couldbe undecided from that moment i observed my friends behaviourattentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for missbennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him your sister i alsowatched her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as everbut without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convincedfrom the evenings scrutiny that though she received his attentionswith pleasure she did not invite them by any participation ofsentiment if you have not been mistaken here i must have beenin error your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latterprobable if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflictpain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable but i shall notscruple to assert that the serenity of your sisters countenance andair was such as might have given the most acute observer a convictionthat however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to beeasily touched that i was desirous of believing her indifferent iscertainbut i will venture to say that my investigation and decisionsare not usually influenced by my hopes or fears i did not believeher to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartialconviction as truly as i wished it in reason my objections to themarriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to havethe utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want ofconnection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me butthere were other causes of repugnance causes which though stillexisting and existing to an equal degree in both instances i hadmyself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately beforeme these causes must be stated though briefly the situation of yourmothers family though objectionable was nothing in comparison to thattotal want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed byherself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by yourfather pardon me it pains me to offend you but amidst your concernfor the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at thisrepresentation of them let it give you consolation to consider that tohave conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censureis praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister thanit is honourable to the sense and disposition of both i will only sayfarther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all partieswas confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have ledme before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappyconnection he left netherfield for london on the day following asyou i am certain remember with the design of soon returningthe part which i acted is now to be explained his sisters uneasinesshad been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling wassoon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost indetaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly inlondon we accordingly wentand there i readily engaged in the officeof pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice idescribed and enforced them earnestly but however this remonstrancemight have staggered or delayed his determination i do not supposethat it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not beenseconded by the assurance that i hesitated not in giving of yoursisters indifference he had before believed her to return hisaffection with sincere if not with equal regard but bingley has greatnatural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on hisown to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself wasno very difficult point to persuade him against returning intohertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely thework of a moment i cannot blame myself for having done thus much thereis but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do notreflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt themeasures of art so far as to conceal from him your sisters being intown i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but herbrother is even yet ignorant of it that they might have met withoutill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to meenough extinguished for him to see her without some danger perhaps thisconcealment this disguise was beneath me it is done however and itwas done for the best on this subject i have nothing more to say noother apology to offer if i have wounded your sisters feelings itwas unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may toyou very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemnthemwith respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injuredmr wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of hisconnection with my family of what he has particularly accused me iam ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon morethan one witness of undoubted veracitymr wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for manyyears the management of all the pemberley estates and whose goodconduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father tobe of service to him and on george wickham who was his godson hiskindness was therefore liberally bestowed my father supported him atschool and afterwards at cambridgemost important assistance as hisown father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would havebeen unable to give him a gentlemans education my father was not onlyfond of this young mans society whose manners were always engaging hehad also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would behis profession intended to provide for him in it as for myself it ismany many years since i first began to think of him in a very differentmanner the vicious propensitiesthe want of principle which he wascareful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escapethe observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himselfand who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which mrdarcy could not have here again i shall give you painto what degreeyou only can tell but whatever may be the sentiments which mr wickhamhas created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me fromunfolding his real characterit adds even another motivemy excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment tomr wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularlyrecommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best mannerthat his profession might allowand if he took orders desired that avaluable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant therewas also a legacy of one thousand pounds his own father did not longsurvive mine and within half a year from these events mr wickhamwrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking ordershe hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some moreimmediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which hecould not be benefited he had some intention he added of studyinglaw and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds wouldbe a very insufficient support therein i rather wished than believedhim to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede tohis proposal i knew that mr wickham ought not to be a clergyman thebusiness was therefore soon settledhe resigned all claim to assistancein the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation toreceive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds all connectionbetween us seemed now dissolved i thought too ill of him to invite himto pemberley or admit his society in town in town i believe he chieflylived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now freefrom all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipationfor about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of theincumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied tome again by letter for the presentation his circumstances he assuredme and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad hehad found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutelyresolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living inquestionof which he trusted there could be little doubt as he waswell assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could nothave forgotten my revered fathers intentions you will hardly blameme for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting everyrepetition to it his resentment was in proportion to the distress ofhis circumstancesand he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of meto others as in his reproaches to myself after this period everyappearance of acquaintance was dropped how he lived i know not butlast summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my noticei must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myselfand which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfoldto any human being having said thus much i feel no doubt of yoursecrecy my sister who is more than ten years my junior was left tothe guardianship of my mothers nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myselfabout a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formedfor her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presidedover it to ramsgate and thither also went mr wickham undoubtedly bydesign for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between himand mrs younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived andby her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgianawhose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness toher as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love andto consent to an elopement she was then but fifteen which must be herexcuse and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owedthe knowledge of it to herself i joined them unexpectedly a day or twobefore the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support theidea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to asa father acknowledged the whole to me you may imagine what i felt andhow i acted regard for my sisters credit and feelings preventedany public exposure but i wrote to mr wickham who left the placeimmediately and mrs younge was of course removed from her charge mrwickhams chief object was unquestionably my sisters fortune whichis thirty thousand pounds but i cannot help supposing that the hope ofrevenging himself on me was a strong inducement his revenge would havebeen complete indeedthis madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we havebeen concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it asfalse you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mrwickham i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood hehad imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wonderedat ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning eitherdetection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not inyour inclinationyou may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night buti was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought tobe revealed for the truth of everything here related i can appeal moreparticularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from ournear relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one ofthe executors of my fathers will has been unavoidably acquaintedwith every particular of these transactions if your abhorrence of meshould make my assertions valueless you cannot be prevented bythe same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may bethe possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find someopportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of themorning i will only add god bless youfitzwilliam darcyif elizabeth when mr darcy gave her the letter did not expect it tocontain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all ofits contents but such as they were it may well be supposed how eagerlyshe went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excitedher feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined with amazement didshe first understand that he believed any apology to be in his powerand steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanationto give which a just sense of shame would not conceal with a strongprejudice against everything he might say she began his account of whathad happened at netherfield she read with an eagerness which hardlyleft her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what thenext sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense ofthe one before her eyes his belief of her sisters insensibility sheinstantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worstobjections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doinghim justice he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfiedher his style was not penitent but haughty it was all pride andinsolencebut when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr wickhamwhenshe read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events whichif true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and whichbore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himselfherfeelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definitionastonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her she wishedto discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be falsethis cannot be this must be the grossest falsehoodand when she hadgone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing anything of thelast page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would notregard it that she would never look in it againin this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest onnothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letterwas unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could sheagain began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham andcommanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentencethe account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly whathe had related himself and the kindness of the late mr darcy thoughshe had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his ownwords so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to thewill the difference was great what wickham had said of the livingwas fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it wasimpossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or theother and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes didnot err but when she read and reread with the closest attention theparticulars immediately following of wickhams resigning all pretensionsto the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as threethousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate she put downthe letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to beimpartialitydeliberated on the probability of each statementbut withlittle success on both sides it was only assertion again she readon but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she hadbelieved it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as torender mr darcys conduct in it less than infamous was capable of aturn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the wholethe extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay atmr wickhams charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she couldbring no proof of its injustice she had never heard of him before hisentrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at thepersuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in townhad there renewed a slight acquaintance of his former way of lifenothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself asto his real character had information been in her power she hadnever felt a wish of inquiring his countenance voice and manner hadestablished him at once in the possession of every virtue she triedto recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait ofintegrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks ofmr darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for thosecasual errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr darcyhad described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance butno such recollection befriended her she could see him instantly beforeher in every charm of air and address but she could remember no moresubstantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood andthe regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess afterpausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued toread but alas the story which followed of his designs on missdarcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonelfitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she wasreferred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliamhimselffrom whom she had previously received the information of hisnear concern in all his cousins affairs and whose character she had noreason to question at one time she had almost resolved on applying tohim but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application andat length wholly banished by the conviction that mr darcy would neverhave hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of hiscousins corroborationshe perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversationbetween wickham and herself in their first evening at mr phillipssmany of his expressions were still fresh in her memory she was nowstruck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger andwondered it had escaped her before she saw the indelicacy of puttinghimself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professionswith his conduct she remembered that he had boasted of having no fearof seeing mr darcythat mr darcy might leave the country but thathe should stand his ground yet he had avoided the netherfield ballthe very next week she remembered also that till the netherfieldfamily had quitted the country he had told his story to no one butherself but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussedthat he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking mr darcyscharacter though he had assured her that respect for the father wouldalways prevent his exposing the sonhow differently did everything now appear in which he was concernedhis attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely andhatefully mercenary and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longerthe moderation of his wishes but his eagerness to grasp at anythinghis behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he hadeither been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifyinghis vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had mostincautiously shown every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainterand fainter and in farther justification of mr darcy she could notbut allow that mr bingley when questioned by jane had long agoasserted his blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive aswere his manners she had never in the whole course of theiracquaintancean acquaintance which had latterly brought them muchtogether and given her a sort of intimacy with his waysseen anythingthat betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjustanything that spoke himof irreligious or immoral habits that among his own connections he wasesteemed and valuedthat even wickham had allowed him merit as abrother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of hissister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling that had hisactions been what mr wickham represented them so gross a violation ofeverything right could hardly have been concealed from the world andthat friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable manas mr bingley was incomprehensibleshe grew absolutely ashamed of herself of neither darcy nor wickhamcould she think without feeling she had been blind partial prejudicedabsurdhow despicably i have acted she cried i who have prided myselfon my discernment i who have valued myself on my abilities who haveoften disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratifiedmy vanity in useless or blameable mistrust how humiliating is thisdiscovery yet how just a humiliation had i been in love i couldnot have been more wretchedly blind but vanity not love has been myfolly pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglectof the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courtedprepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either wereconcerned till this moment i never knew myselffrom herself to janefrom jane to bingley her thoughts were in a linewhich soon brought to her recollection that mr darcys explanationthere had appeared very insufficient and she read it again widelydifferent was the effect of a second perusal how could she deny thatcredit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged togive in the other he declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of hersisters attachment and she could not help remembering what charlottesopinion had always been neither could she deny the justice of hisdescription of jane she felt that janes feelings though fervent werelittle displayed and that there was a constant complacency in her airand manner not often united with great sensibilitywhen she came to that part of the letter in which her family werementioned in terms of such mortifying yet merited reproach her senseof shame was severe the justice of the charge struck her too forciblyfor denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded ashaving passed at the netherfield ball and as confirming all his firstdisapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mindthan on hersthe compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt it soothedbut it could not console her for the contempt which had thus beenselfattracted by the rest of her family and as she consideredthat janes disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearestrelations and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurtby such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed beyond anything shehad ever known beforeafter wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to everyvariety of thoughtreconsidering events determining probabilitiesand reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden andso important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence madeher at length return home and she entered the house with the wishof appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing suchreflections as must make her unfit for conversationshe was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had eachcalled during her absence mr darcy only for a few minutes to takeleavebut that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at leastan hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after hertill she could be found elizabeth could but just affect concernin missing him she really rejoiced at it colonel fitzwilliam was nolonger an object she could think only of her letterthe two gentlemen left rosings the next morning and mr collins havingbeen in waiting near the lodges to make them his parting obeisance wasable to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in verygood health and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected after themelancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings to rosings he thenhastened to console lady catherine and her daughter and on his returnbrought back with great satisfaction a message from her ladyshipimporting that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous ofhaving them all to dine with herelizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that hadshe chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her asher future niece nor could she think without a smile of what herladyships indignation would have been what would she have said howwould she have behaved were questions with which she amused herselftheir first subject was the diminution of the rosings party i assureyou i feel it exceedingly said lady catherine i believe no onefeels the loss of friends so much as i do but i am particularlyattached to these young men and know them to be so much attached tome they were excessively sorry to go but so they always are thedear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last but darcyseemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year hisattachment to rosings certainly increasesmr collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here whichwere kindly smiled on by the mother and daughterlady catherine observed after dinner that miss bennet seemed out ofspirits and immediately accounting for it by herself by supposing thatshe did not like to go home again so soon she addedbut if that is the case you must write to your mother and beg thatyou may stay a little longer mrs collins will be very glad of yourcompany i am surei am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation repliedelizabeth but it is not in my power to accept it i must be in townnext saturdaywhy at that rate you will have been here only six weeks i expectedyou to stay two months i told mrs collins so before you came therecan be no occasion for your going so soon mrs bennet could certainlyspare you for another fortnightbut my father cannot he wrote last week to hurry my returnoh your father of course may spare you if your mother can daughtersare never of so much consequence to a father and if you will stayanother month complete it will be in my power to take one of you asfar as london for i am going there early in june for a week and asdawson does not object to the barouchebox there will be very good roomfor one of youand indeed if the weather should happen to be cool ishould not object to taking you both as you are neither of you largeyou are all kindness madam but i believe we must abide by ouroriginal planlady catherine seemed resigned mrs collins you must send a servantwith them you know i always speak my mind and i cannot bear the ideaof two young women travelling post by themselves it is highly improperyou must contrive to send somebody i have the greatest dislike inthe world to that sort of thing young women should always be properlyguarded and attended according to their situation in life when myniece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer i made a point of herhaving two menservants go with her miss darcy the daughter ofmr darcy of pemberley and lady anne could not have appeared withpropriety in a different manner i am excessively attentive to all thosethings you must send john with the young ladies mrs collins iam glad it occurred to me to mention it for it would really bediscreditable to you to let them go alonemy uncle is to send a servant for usoh your uncle he keeps a manservant does he i am very glad youhave somebody who thinks of these things where shall you change horsesoh bromley of course if you mention my name at the bell you will beattended tolady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journeyand as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessarywhich elizabeth believed to be lucky for her or with a mind sooccupied she might have forgotten where she was reflection must bereserved for solitary hours whenever she was alone she gave way to itas the greatest relief and not a day went by without a solitarywalk in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasantrecollectionsmr darcys letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart shestudied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were attimes widely different when she remembered the style of his addressshe was still full of indignation but when she considered how unjustlyshe had condemned and upbraided him her anger was turned againstherself and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassionhis attachment excited gratitude his general character respect but shecould not approve him nor could she for a moment repent her refusalor feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again in her own pastbehaviour there was a constant source of vexation and regret and inthe unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrinthey were hopeless of remedy her father contented with laughing atthem would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of hisyoungest daughters and her mother with manners so far from rightherself was entirely insensible of the evil elizabeth had frequentlyunited with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherineand lydia but while they were supported by their mothers indulgencewhat chance could there be of improvement catherine weakspiritedirritable and completely under lydias guidance had been alwaysaffronted by their advice and lydia selfwilled and careless wouldscarcely give them a hearing they were ignorant idle and vain whilethere was an officer in meryton they would flirt with him and whilemeryton was within a walk of longbourn they would be going thereforeveranxiety on janes behalf was another prevailing concern and mr darcysexplanation by restoring bingley to all her former good opinionheightened the sense of what jane had lost his affection was provedto have been sincere and his conduct cleared of all blame unless anycould attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend howgrievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in everyrespect so replete with advantage so promising for happiness jane hadbeen deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own familywhen to these recollections was added the development of wickhamscharacter it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which hadseldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make italmost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerfultheir engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week ofher stay as they had been at first the very last evening was spentthere and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars oftheir journey gave them directions as to the best method of packingand was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only rightway that maria thought herself obliged on her return to undo all thework of the morning and pack her trunk afreshwhen they parted lady catherine with great condescension wished thema good journey and invited them to come to hunsford again next yearand miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out herhand to bothon saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast a fewminutes before the others appeared and he took the opportunity ofpaying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessaryi know not miss elizabeth said he whether mrs collins has yetexpressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i am verycertain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks forit the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you weknow how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode our plainmanner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little wesee of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady likeyourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescensionand that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spendingyour time unpleasantlyelizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness shehad spent six weeks with great enjoyment and the pleasure of being withcharlotte and the kind attentions she had received must make herfeel the obliged mr collins was gratified and with a more smilingsolemnity repliedit gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time notdisagreeably we have certainly done our best and most fortunatelyhaving it in our power to introduce you to very superior society andfrom our connection with rosings the frequent means of varying thehumble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsfordvisit cannot have been entirely irksome our situation with regard tolady catherines family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantageand blessing which few can boast you see on what a footing we are yousee how continually we are engaged there in truth i must acknowledgethat with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i shouldnot think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion while they aresharers of our intimacy at rosingswords were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings and he wasobliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to unite civilityand truth in a few short sentencesyou may in fact carry a very favourable report of us intohertfordshire my dear cousin i flatter myself at least that you willbe able to do so lady catherines great attentions to mrs collins youhave been a daily witness of and altogether i trust it does not appearthat your friend has drawn an unfortunatebut on this point it will beas well to be silent only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeththat i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity inmarriage my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way ofthinking there is in everything a most remarkable resemblance ofcharacter and ideas between us we seem to have been designed for eachotherelizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that wasthe case and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believedand rejoiced in his domestic comforts she was not sorry however tohave the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprangpoor charlotte it was melancholy to leave her to such society but shehad chosen it with her eyes open and though evidently regretting thather visitors were to go she did not seem to ask for compassion herhome and her housekeeping her parish and her poultry and all theirdependent concerns had not yet lost their charmsat length the chaise arrived the trunks were fastened on the parcelsplaced within and it was pronounced to be ready after an affectionateparting between the friends elizabeth was attended to the carriage bymr collins and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning herwith his best respects to all her family not forgetting his thanksfor the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter and hiscompliments to mr and mrs gardiner though unknown he then handed herin maria followed and the door was on the point of being closedwhen he suddenly reminded them with some consternation that they hadhitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at rosingsbut he added you will of course wish to have your humble respectsdelivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to youwhile you have been hereelizabeth made no objection the door was then allowed to be shut andthe carriage drove offgood gracious cried maria after a few minutes silence it seemsbut a day or two since we first came and yet how many things havehappeneda great many indeed said her companion with a sighwe have dined nine times at rosings besides drinking tea there twicehow much i shall have to tellelizabeth added privately and how much i shall have to concealtheir journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm andwithin four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr gardinershouse where they were to remain a few daysjane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying herspirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of heraunt had reserved for them but jane was to go home with her and atlongbourn there would be leisure enough for observationit was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even forlongbourn before she told her sister of mr darcys proposals to knowthat she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonishjane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her ownvanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptationto openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecisionin which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicateand her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurriedinto repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sisterfurtherit was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set outtogether from gracechurch street for the town of  in hertfordshireand as they drew near the appointed inn where mr bennets carriagewas to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachmanspunctuality both kitty and lydia looking out of a diningroom up stairsthese two girls had been above an hour in the place happily employedin visiting an opposite milliner watching the sentinel on guard anddressing a salad and cucumberafter welcoming their sisters they triumphantly displayed a table setout with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords exclaimingis not this nice is not this an agreeable surpriseand we mean to treat you all added lydia but you must lend us themoney for we have just spent ours at the shop out there then showingher purchaseslook here i have bought this bonnet i do not thinkit is very pretty but i thought i might as well buy it as not i shallpull it to pieces as soon as i get home and see if i can make it up anybetterand when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfectunconcern oh but there were two or three much uglier in the shop andwhen i have bought some prettiercoloured satin to trim it with fresh ithink it will be very tolerable besides it will not much signify whatone wears this summer after the shire have left meryton and theyare going in a fortnightare they indeed cried elizabeth with the greatest satisfactionthey are going to be encamped near brighton and i do so want papa totake us all there for the summer it would be such a delicious schemeand i dare say would hardly cost anything at all mamma would like togo too of all things only think what a miserable summer else we shallhaveyes thought elizabeth that would be a delightful scheme indeedand completely do for us at once good heaven brighton and a wholecampful of soldiers to us who have been overset already by one poorregiment of militia and the monthly balls of merytonnow i have got some news for you said lydia as they sat down attable what do you think it is excellent newscapital newsand abouta certain person we all likejane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told he neednot stay lydia laughed and saidaye that is just like your formality and discretion you thought thewaiter must not hear as if he cared i dare say he often hears worsethings said than i am going to say but he is an ugly fellow i am gladhe is gone i never saw such a long chin in my life well but now formy news it is about dear wickham too good for the waiter is it notthere is no danger of wickhams marrying mary king theres for you sheis gone down to her uncle at liverpool gone to stay wickham is safeand mary king is safe added elizabeth safe from a connectionimprudent as to fortuneshe is a great fool for going away if she liked himbut i hope there is no strong attachment on either side said janei am sure there is not on his i will answer for it he never caredthree straws about herwho could about such a nasty little freckledthingelizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of suchcoarseness of expression herself the coarseness of the sentimentwas little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberalas soon as all had ate and the elder ones paid the carriage wasordered and after some contrivance the whole party with all theirboxes workbags and parcels and the unwelcome addition of kittys andlydias purchases were seated in ithow nicely we are all crammed in cried lydia i am glad i bought mybonnet if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox well nowlet us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the wayhome and in the first place let us hear what has happened to you allsince you went away have you seen any pleasant men have you had anyflirting i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husbandbefore you came back jane will be quite an old maid soon i declareshe is almost threeandtwenty lord how ashamed i should be of notbeing married before threeandtwenty my aunt phillips wants you so toget husbands you cant think she says lizzy had better have taken mrcollins but i do not think there would have been any fun in it lordhow i should like to be married before any of you and then i wouldchaperon you about to all the balls dear me we had such a good pieceof fun the other day at colonel forsters kitty and me were to spendthe day there and mrs forster promised to have a little dance in theevening by the bye mrs forster and me are such friends and soshe asked the two harringtons to come but harriet was ill and so penwas forced to come by herself and then what do you think we did wedressed up chamberlayne in womans clothes on purpose to pass for alady only think what fun not a soul knew of it but colonel and mrsforster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrowone of her gowns and you cannot imagine how well he looked when dennyand wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in theydid not know him in the least lord how i laughed and so did mrsforster i thought i should have died and that made the men suspectsomething and then they soon found out what was the matterwith such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes didlydia assisted by kittys hints and additions endeavour to amuse hercompanions all the way to longbourn elizabeth listened as little as shecould but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickhams nametheir reception at home was most kind mrs bennet rejoiced to see janein undiminished beauty and more than once during dinner did mr bennetsay voluntarily to elizabethi am glad you are come back lizzytheir party in the diningroom was large for almost all the lucasescame to meet maria and hear the news and various were the subjects thatoccupied them lady lucas was inquiring of maria after the welfare andpoultry of her eldest daughter mrs bennet was doubly engaged on onehand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane who satsome way below her and on the other retailing them all to the youngerlucases and lydia in a voice rather louder than any other personswas enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody whowould hear heroh mary said she i wish you had gone with us for we had such funas we went along kitty and i drew up the blinds and pretended therewas nobody in the coach and i should have gone so all the way if kittyhad not been sick and when we got to the george i do think we behavedvery handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest coldluncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have treatedyou too and then when we came away it was such fun i thought we nevershould have got into the coach i was ready to die of laughter and thenwe were so merry all the way home we talked and laughed so loud thatanybody might have heard us ten miles offto this mary very gravely replied far be it from me my dear sisterto depreciate such pleasures they would doubtless be congenial with thegenerality of female minds but i confess they would have no charms formei should infinitely prefer a bookbut of this answer lydia heard not a word she seldom listened toanybody for more than half a minute and never attended to mary at allin the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walkto meryton and to see how everybody went on but elizabeth steadilyopposed the scheme it should not be said that the miss bennets couldnot be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officersthere was another reason too for her opposition she dreaded seeing mrwickham again and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible thecomfort to her of the regiments approaching removal was indeed beyondexpression in a fortnight they were to goand once gone she hopedthere could be nothing more to plague her on his accountshe had not been many hours at home before she found that the brightonscheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was underfrequent discussion between her parents elizabeth saw directly that herfather had not the smallest intention of yielding but his answers wereat the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though oftendisheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at lastelizabeths impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened couldno longer be overcome and at length resolving to suppress everyparticular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to besurprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scenebetween mr darcy and herselfmiss bennets astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterlypartiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectlynatural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings she wassorry that mr darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner solittle suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for theunhappiness which her sisters refusal must have given himhis being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she and certainlyought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase hisdisappointmentindeed replied elizabeth i am heartily sorry for him but he hasother feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for meyou do not blame me however for refusing himblame you oh nobut you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickhamnoi do not know that you were wrong in saying what you didbut you will know it when i tell you what happened the very nextdayshe then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as faras they concerned george wickham what a stroke was this for poor janewho would willingly have gone through the world without believing thatso much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was herecollected in one individual nor was darcys vindication thoughgrateful to her feelings capable of consoling her for such discoverymost earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error andseek to clear the one without involving the otherthis will not do said elizabeth you never will be able to make bothof them good for anything take your choice but you must be satisfiedwith only one there is but such a quantity of merit between them justenough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been shiftingabout pretty much for my part i am inclined to believe it all darcysbut you shall do as you chooseit was some time however before a smile could be extorted from janei do not know when i have been more shocked said she wickham sovery bad it is almost past belief and poor mr darcy dear lizzy onlyconsider what he must have suffered such a disappointment and with theknowledge of your ill opinion too and having to relate such a thingof his sister it is really too distressing i am sure you must feel itsooh no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you sofull of both i know you will do him such ample justice that i amgrowing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent your profusionmakes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart willbe as light as a featherpoor wickham there is such an expression of goodness in hiscountenance such an openness and gentleness in his mannerthere certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of thosetwo young men one has got all the goodness and the other all theappearance of iti never thought mr darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as youused to doand yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a disliketo him without any reason it is such a spur to ones genius such anopening for wit to have a dislike of that kind one may be continuallyabusive without saying anything just but one cannot always be laughingat a man without now and then stumbling on something wittylizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treatthe matter as you do nowindeed i could not i was uncomfortable enough i may say unhappy andwith no one to speak to about what i felt no jane to comfort me and saythat i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew ihad oh how i wanted youhow unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressionsin speaking of wickham to mr darcy for now they do appear whollyundeservedcertainly but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a mostnatural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging thereis one point on which i want your advice i want to be told whether iought or ought not to make our acquaintances in general understandwickhams charactermiss bennet paused a little and then replied surely there can be nooccasion for exposing him so dreadfully what is your opinionthat it ought not to be attempted mr darcy has not authorised meto make his communication public on the contrary every particularrelative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible tomyself and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of hisconduct who will believe me the general prejudice against mr darcyis so violent that it would be the death of half the good people inmeryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light i am not equalto it wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify toanyone here what he really is some time hence it will be all found outand then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before atpresent i will say nothing about ityou are quite right to have his errors made public might ruin him forever he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious toreestablish a character we must not make him desperatethe tumult of elizabeths mind was allayed by this conversation she hadgot rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnightand was certain of a willing listener in jane whenever she might wishto talk again of either but there was still something lurking behindof which prudence forbade the disclosure she dared not relate the otherhalf of mr darcys letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely shehad been valued by her friend here was knowledge in which no onecould partake and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfectunderstanding between the parties could justify her in throwing offthis last encumbrance of mystery and then said she if that veryimprobable event should ever take place i shall merely be able totell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself theliberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its valueshe was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the realstate of her sisters spirits jane was not happy she still cherished avery tender affection for bingley having never even fancied herselfin love before her regard had all the warmth of first attachmentand from her age and disposition greater steadiness than most firstattachments often boast and so fervently did she value his remembranceand prefer him to every other man that all her good sense and all herattention to the feelings of her friends were requisite to check theindulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her ownhealth and their tranquillitywell lizzy said mrs bennet one day what is your opinion now ofthis sad business of janes for my part i am determined never to speakof it again to anybody i told my sister phillips so the other day buti cannot find out that jane saw anything of him in london well he isa very undeserving young manand i do not suppose theres the leastchance in the world of her ever getting him now there is no talk ofhis coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have inquired ofeverybody too who is likely to knowi do not believe he will ever live at netherfield any moreoh well it is just as he chooses nobody wants him to come though ishall always say he used my daughter extremely ill and if i was her iwould not have put up with it well my comfort is i am sure jane willdie of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has donebut as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectationshe made no answerwell lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and so thecollinses live very comfortable do they well well i only hopeit will last and what sort of table do they keep charlotte is anexcellent manager i dare say if she is half as sharp as hermother she is saving enough there is nothing extravagant in theirhousekeeping i dare sayno nothing at alla great deal of good management depend upon it yes yes they willtake care not to outrun their income they will never be distressedfor money well much good may it do them and so i suppose they oftentalk of having longbourn when your father is dead they look upon it asquite their own i dare say whenever that happensit was a subject which they could not mention before meno it would have been strange if they had but i make no doubt theyoften talk of it between themselves well if they can be easy with anestate that is not lawfully their own so much the better i should beashamed of having one that was only entailed on methe first week of their return was soon gone the second began it wasthe last of the regiments stay in meryton and all the young ladiesin the neighbourhood were drooping apace the dejection was almostuniversal the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat drinkand sleep and pursue the usual course of their employments veryfrequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty andlydia whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend suchhardheartedness in any of the familygood heaven what is to become of us what are we to do would theyoften exclaim in the bitterness of woe how can you be smiling solizzytheir affectionate mother shared all their grief she remembered whatshe had herself endured on a similar occasion fiveandtwenty yearsagoi am sure said she i cried for two days together when colonelmillers regiment went away i thought i should have broken my hearti am sure i shall break mine said lydiaif one could but go to brighton observed mrs bennetoh yesif one could but go to brighton but papa is sodisagreeablea little seabathing would set me up foreverand my aunt phillips is sure it would do me a great deal of good added kittysuch were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually throughlongbourn house elizabeth tried to be diverted by them but all senseof pleasure was lost in shame she felt anew the justice of mr darcysobjections and never had she been so much disposed to pardon hisinterference in the views of his friendbut the gloom of lydias prospect was shortly cleared away for shereceived an invitation from mrs forster the wife of the colonel ofthe regiment to accompany her to brighton this invaluable friend was avery young woman and very lately married a resemblance in good humourand good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out oftheir three months acquaintance they had been intimate twothe rapture of lydia on this occasion her adoration of mrs forsterthe delight of mrs bennet and the mortification of kitty are scarcelyto be described wholly inattentive to her sisters feelings lydiaflew about the house in restless ecstasy calling for everyonescongratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than everwhilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fatein terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevishi cannot see why mrs forster should not ask me as well as lydia said she though i am not her particular friend i have just as muchright to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years olderin vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to makeher resigned as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far fromexciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that sheconsidered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sensefor the latter and detestable as such a step must make her were itknown she could not help secretly advising her father not to let hergo she represented to him all the improprieties of lydias generalbehaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship ofsuch a woman as mrs forster and the probability of her being yet moreimprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations mustbe greater than at home he heard her attentively and then saidlydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some publicplace or other and we can never expect her to do it with solittle expense or inconvenience to her family as under the presentcircumstancesif you were aware said elizabeth of the very great disadvantage tous all which must arise from the public notice of lydias unguarded andimprudent mannernay which has already arisen from it i am sure youwould judge differently in the affairalready arisen repeated mr bennet what has she frightened awaysome of your lovers poor little lizzy but do not be cast down suchsqueamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdityare not worth a regret come let me see the list of pitiful fellows whohave been kept aloof by lydias follyindeed you are mistaken i have no such injuries to resent it is notof particular but of general evils which i am now complaining ourimportance our respectability in the world must be affected by thewild volatility the assurance and disdain of all restraint which marklydias character excuse me for i must speak plainly if you my dearfather will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits andof teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business ofher life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment her characterwill be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirtthat ever made herself or her family ridiculous a flirt too in theworst and meanest degree of flirtation without any attraction beyondyouth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and emptinessof her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universalcontempt which her rage for admiration will excite in this dangerkitty also is comprehended she will follow wherever lydia leads vainignorant idle and absolutely uncontrolled oh my dear father can yousuppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised whereverthey are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in thedisgracemr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject andaffectionately taking her hand said in replydo not make yourself uneasy my love wherever you and jane are knownyou must be respected and valued and you will not appear to lessadvantage for having a couple ofor i may say threevery sillysisters we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go tobrighton let her go then colonel forster is a sensible man and willkeep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be anobject of prey to anybody at brighton she will be of less importanceeven as a common flirt than she has been here the officers will findwomen better worth their notice let us hope therefore that her beingthere may teach her her own insignificance at any rate she cannot growmany degrees worse without authorising us to lock her up for the restof her lifewith this answer elizabeth was forced to be content but her own opinioncontinued the same and she left him disappointed and sorry it was notin her nature however to increase her vexations by dwelling onthem she was confident of having performed her duty and to fretover unavoidable evils or augment them by anxiety was no part of herdispositionhad lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with herfather their indignation would hardly have found expression in theirunited volubility in lydias imagination a visit to brighton comprisedevery possibility of earthly happiness she saw with the creative eyeof fancy the streets of that gay bathingplace covered with officersshe saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of themat present unknown she saw all the glories of the campits tentsstretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines crowded with the youngand the gay and dazzling with scarlet and to complete the view shesaw herself seated beneath a tent tenderly flirting with at least sixofficers at oncehad she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and suchrealities as these what would have been her sensations they could havebeen understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the samelydias going to brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholyconviction of her husbands never intending to go there himselfbut they were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their rapturescontinued with little intermission to the very day of lydias leavinghomeelizabeth was now to see mr wickham for the last time having beenfrequently in company with him since her return agitation was prettywell over the agitations of former partiality entirely so she had evenlearnt to detect in the very gentleness which had first delightedher an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary in his presentbehaviour to herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasurefor the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions whichhad marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve afterwhat had since passed to provoke her she lost all concern for him infinding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolousgallantry and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel thereproof contained in his believing that however long and for whatevercause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratifiedand her preference secured at any time by their renewalon the very last day of the regiments remaining at meryton he dinedwith other of the officers at longbourn and so little was elizabethdisposed to part from him in good humour that on his making someinquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford shementioned colonel fitzwilliams and mr darcys having both spent threeweeks at rosings and asked him if he was acquainted with the formerhe looked surprised displeased alarmed but with a momentsrecollection and a returning smile replied that he had formerly seenhim often and after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike manasked her how she had liked him her answer was warmly in his favourwith an air of indifference he soon afterwards addedhow long did you say he was at rosingsnearly three weeksand you saw him frequentlyyes almost every dayhis manners are very different from his cousinsyes very different but i think mr darcy improves upon acquaintanceindeed cried mr wickham with a look which did not escape her andpray may i ask but checking himself he added in a gayer tone isit in address that he improves has he deigned to add aught of civilityto his ordinary stylefor i dare not hope he continued in a lowerand more serious tone that he is improved in essentialsoh no said elizabeth in essentials i believe he is very muchwhat he ever waswhile she spoke wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether torejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning there was asomething in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensiveand anxious attention while she addedwhen i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean thathis mind or his manners were in a state of improvement but that fromknowing him better his disposition was better understoodwickhams alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitatedlook for a few minutes he was silent till shaking off hisembarrassment he turned to her again and said in the gentlest ofaccentsyou who so well know my feeling towards mr darcy will readilycomprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assumeeven the appearance of what is right his pride in that directionmay be of service if not to himself to many others for it must onlydeter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by i onlyfear that the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have beenalluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose goodopinion and judgement he stands much in awe his fear of her has alwaysoperated i know when they were together and a good deal is to beimputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which iam certain he has very much at heartelizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered only by aslight inclination of the head she saw that he wanted to engage her onthe old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulgehim the rest of the evening passed with the appearance on hisside of usual cheerfulness but with no further attempt to distinguishelizabeth and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly amutual desire of never meeting againwhen the party broke up lydia returned with mrs forster to merytonfrom whence they were to set out early the next morning the separationbetween her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic kitty was theonly one who shed tears but she did weep from vexation and envy mrsbennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughterand impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss theopportunity of enjoying herself as much as possibleadvice whichthere was every reason to believe
