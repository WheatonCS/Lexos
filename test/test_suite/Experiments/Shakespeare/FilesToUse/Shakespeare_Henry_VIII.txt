Those that can pity here    May, if they think it well, let fall a tear:    The subject will deserve it. Such as give    Their money out of hope they may believe    May here find truth too. Those that come to see    Only a show or two, and so agree    The play may pass, if they be still and willing,    I'll undertake may see away their shilling    Richly in two short hours. Only they    That come to hear a merry bawdy play,    A noise of targets, or to see a fellow    In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,    Will be deceiv'd; for, gentle hearers, know,    To rank our chosen truth with such a show    As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting    Our own brains, and the opinion that we bring    To make that only true we now intend,    Will leave us never an understanding friend.    Therefore, for goodness sake, and as you are known    The first and happiest hearers of the town,    Be sad, as we would make ye. Think ye see    The very persons of our noble story    As they were living; think you see them great,    And follow'd with the general throng and sweat    Of thousand friends; then, in a moment, see    How soon this mightiness meets misery.    And if you can be merry then, I'll say    A man may weep upon his wedding-day.ACT I. SCENE 1.London. The palaceEnter the DUKE OF NORFOLK at one door; at the other,the DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM and the LORD ABERGAVENNY  BUCKINGHAM. Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done    Since last we saw in France?  NORFOLK. I thank your Grace,    Healthful; and ever since a fresh admirer    Of what I saw there.  BUCKINGHAM. An untimely ague    Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when    Those suns of glory, those two lights of men,    Met in the vale of Andren.  NORFOLK. 'Twixt Guynes and Arde-    I was then present, saw them salute on horseback;    Beheld them, when they lighted, how they clung    In their embracement, as they grew together;    Which had they, what four thron'd ones could have weigh'd    Such a compounded one?  BUCKINGHAM. All the whole time    I was my chamber's prisoner.  NORFOLK. Then you lost    The view of earthly glory; men might say,    Till this time pomp was single, but now married    To one above itself. Each following day    Became the next day's master, till the last    Made former wonders its. To-day the French,    All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,    Shone down the English; and to-morrow they    Made Britain India: every man that stood    Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were    As cherubins, an gilt; the madams too,    Not us'd to toil, did almost sweat to bear    The pride upon them, that their very labour    Was to them as a painting. Now this masque    Was cried incomparable; and th' ensuing night    Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,    Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,    As presence did present them: him in eye    still him in praise; and being present both,    'Twas said they saw but one, and no discerner    Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns-    For so they phrase 'em-by their heralds challeng'd    The noble spirits to arms, they did perform    Beyond thought's compass, that former fabulous story,    Being now seen possible enough, got credit,    That Bevis was believ'd.  BUCKINGHAM. O, you go far!  NORFOLK. As I belong to worship, and affect    In honour honesty, the tract of ev'rything    Would by a good discourser lose some life    Which action's self was tongue to. All was royal:    To the disposing of it nought rebell'd;    Order gave each thing view. The office did    Distinctly his full function.  BUCKINGHAM. Who did guide-    I mean, who set the body and the limbs    Of this great sport together, as you guess?  NORFOLK. One, certes, that promises no element    In such a business.  BUCKINGHAM. I pray you, who, my lord?  NORFOLK. All this was ord'red by the good discretion    Of the right reverend Cardinal of York.  BUCKINGHAM. The devil speed him! No man's pie is freed    From his ambitious finger. What had he    To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder    That such a keech can with his very bulk    Take up the rays o' th' beneficial sun,    And keep it from the earth.  NORFOLK. Surely, sir,    There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends;    For, being not propp'd by ancestry, whose grace    Chalks successors their way, nor call'd upon    For high feats done to th' crown, neither allied    To eminent assistants, but spider-like,    Out of his self-drawing web, 'a gives us note    The force of his own merit makes his way-    A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys    A place next to the King.  ABERGAVENNY. I cannot tell    What heaven hath given him-let some graver eye    Pierce into that; but I can see his pride    Peep through each part of him. Whence has he that?    If not from hell, the devil is a niggard    Or has given all before, and he begins    A new hell in himself.  BUCKINGHAM. Why the devil,    Upon this French going out, took he upon him-    Without the privity o' th' King-t' appoint    Who should attend on him? He makes up the file    Of all the gentry; for the most part such    To whom as great a charge as little honour    He meant to lay upon; and his own letter,    The honourable board of council out,    Must fetch him in he papers.  ABERGAVENNY. I do know    Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have    By this so sicken'd their estates that never    They shall abound as formerly.  BUCKINGHAM. O, many    Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em    For this great journey. What did this vanity    But minister communication of    A most poor issue?  NORFOLK. Grievingly I think    The peace between the French and us not values    The cost that did conclude it.  BUCKINGHAM. Every man,    After the hideous storm that follow'd, was    A thing inspir'd, and, not consulting, broke    Into a general prophecy-that this tempest,    Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded    The sudden breach on't.  NORFOLK. Which is budded out;    For France hath flaw'd the league, and hath attach'd    Our merchants' goods at Bordeaux.  ABERGAVENNY. Is it therefore    Th' ambassador is silenc'd?  NORFOLK. Marry, is't.  ABERGAVENNY. A proper tide of a peace, and purchas'd    At a superfluous rate!  BUCKINGHAM. Why, all this business    Our reverend Cardinal carried.  NORFOLK. Like it your Grace,    The state takes notice of the private difference    Betwixt you and the Cardinal. I advise you-    And take it from a heart that wishes towards you    Honour and plenteous safety-that you read    The Cardinal's malice and his potency    Together; to consider further, that    What his high hatred would effect wants not    A minister in his power. You know his nature,    That he's revengeful; and I know his sword    Hath a sharp edge-it's long and't may be said    It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend,    Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel    You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock    That I advise your shunning.      Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, the purse borne before      him, certain of the guard, and two SECRETARIES      with papers. The CARDINAL in his passage fixeth his      eye on BUCKINGHAM, and BUCKINGHAM on him,      both full of disdain  WOLSEY. The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor? Ha!    Where's his examination?  SECRETARY. Here, so please you.  WOLSEY. Is he in person ready?  SECRETARY. Ay, please your Grace.  WOLSEY. Well, we shall then know more, and Buckingham    shall lessen this big look.                                          Exeunt WOLSEY and his train  BUCKINGHAM. This butcher's cur is venom-mouth'd, and I    Have not the power to muzzle him; therefore best    Not wake him in his slumber. A beggar's book    Outworths a noble's blood.  NORFOLK. What, are you chaf'd?    Ask God for temp'rance; that's th' appliance only    Which your disease requires.  BUCKINGHAM. I read in's looks    Matter against me, and his eye revil'd    Me as his abject object. At this instant    He bores me with some trick. He's gone to th' King;    I'll follow, and outstare him.  NORFOLK. Stay, my lord,    And let your reason with your choler question    What 'tis you go about. To climb steep hills    Requires slow pace at first. Anger is like    A full hot horse, who being allow'd his way,    Self-mettle tires him. Not a man in England    Can advise me like you; be to yourself    As you would to your friend.  BUCKINGHAM. I'll to the King,    And from a mouth of honour quite cry down    This Ipswich fellow's insolence; or proclaim    There's difference in no persons.  NORFOLK. Be advis'd:    Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot    That it do singe yourself. We may outrun    By violent swiftness that which we run at,    And lose by over-running. Know you not    The fire that mounts the liquor till't run o'er    In seeming to augment it wastes it? Be advis'd.    I say again there is no English soul    More stronger to direct you than yourself,    If with the sap of reason you would quench    Or but allay the fire of passion.  BUCKINGHAM. Sir,    I am thankful to you, and I'll go along    By your prescription; but this top-proud fellow-    Whom from the flow of gan I name not, but    From sincere motions, by intelligence,    And proofs as clear as founts in July when    We see each grain of gravel-I do know    To be corrupt and treasonous.  NORFOLK. Say not treasonous.  BUCKINGHAM. To th' King I'll say't, and make my vouch as strong    As shore of rock. Attend: this holy fox,    Or wolf, or both-for he is equal rav'nous    As he is subtle, and as prone to mischief    As able to perform't, his mind and place    Infecting one another, yea, reciprocally-    Only to show his pomp as well in France    As here at home, suggests the King our master    To this last costly treaty, th' interview    That swallowed so much treasure and like a glass    Did break i' th' wrenching.  NORFOLK. Faith, and so it did.  BUCKINGHAM. Pray, give me favour, sir; this cunning cardinal    The articles o' th' combination drew    As himself pleas'd; and they were ratified    As he cried 'Thus let be' to as much end    As give a crutch to th' dead. But our Count-Cardinal    Has done this, and 'tis well; for worthy Wolsey,    Who cannot err, he did it. Now this follows,    Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy    To th' old dam treason: Charles the Emperor,    Under pretence to see the Queen his aunt-    For 'twas indeed his colour, but he came    To whisper Wolsey-here makes visitation-    His fears were that the interview betwixt    England and France might through their amity    Breed him some prejudice; for from this league    Peep'd harms that menac'd him-privily    Deals with our Cardinal; and, as I trow-    Which I do well, for I am sure the Emperor    Paid ere he promis'd; whereby his suit was granted    Ere it was ask'd-but when the way was made,    And pav'd with gold, the Emperor thus desir'd,    That he would please to alter the King's course,    And break the foresaid peace. Let the King know,    As soon he shall by me, that thus the Cardinal    Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases,    And for his own advantage.  NORFOLK. I am sorry    To hear this of him, and could wish he were    Something mistaken in't.  BUCKINGHAM. No, not a syllable:    I do pronounce him in that very shape    He shall appear in proof.       Enter BRANDON, a SERGEANT-AT-ARMS before him,              and two or three of the guard  BRANDON. Your office, sergeant: execute it.  SERGEANT. Sir,    My lord the Duke of Buckingham, and Earl    Of Hereford, Stafford, and Northampton, I    Arrest thee of high treason, in the name    Of our most sovereign King.  BUCKINGHAM. Lo you, my lord,    The net has fall'n upon me! I shall perish    Under device and practice.  BRANDON. I am sorry    To see you ta'en from liberty, to look on    The business present; 'tis his Highness' pleasure    You shall to th' Tower.  BUCKINGHAM. It will help nothing    To plead mine innocence; for that dye is on me    Which makes my whit'st part black. The will of heav'n    Be done in this and all things! I obey.    O my Lord Aberga'ny, fare you well!  BRANDON. Nay, he must bear you company.    [To ABERGAVENNY]  The King    Is pleas'd you shall to th' Tower, till you know    How he determines further.  ABERGAVENNY. As the Duke said,    The will of heaven be done, and the King's pleasure    By me obey'd.  BRANDON. Here is warrant from    The King t' attach Lord Montacute and the bodies    Of the Duke's confessor, John de la Car,    One Gilbert Peck, his chancellor-  BUCKINGHAM. So, so!    These are the limbs o' th' plot; no more, I hope.  BRANDON. A monk o' th' Chartreux.  BUCKINGHAM. O, Nicholas Hopkins?  BRANDON. He.  BUCKINGHAM. My surveyor is false. The o'er-great Cardinal    Hath show'd him gold; my life is spann'd already.    I am the shadow of poor Buckingham,    Whose figure even this instant cloud puts on    By dark'ning my clear sun. My lord, farewell.    ExeuntACT I. SCENE 2.London. The Council ChamberCornets. Enter KING HENRY, leaning on the CARDINAL'S shoulder, the NOBLES,and SIR THOMAS LOVELL, with others. The CARDINAL places himselfunder the KING'S feet on his right side  KING. My life itself, and the best heart of it,    Thanks you for this great care; I stood i' th' level    Of a full-charg'd confederacy, and give thanks    To you that chok'd it. Let be call'd before us    That gentleman of Buckingham's. In person    I'll hear his confessions justify;    And point by point the treasons of his master    He shall again relate.      A noise within, crying 'Room for the Queen!'      Enter the QUEEN, usher'd by the DUKES OF NORFOLK      and SUFFOLK; she kneels. The KING riseth      from his state, takes her up, kisses and placeth her      by him  QUEEN KATHARINE. Nay, we must longer kneel: I am suitor.  KING. Arise, and take place by us. Half your suit    Never name to us: you have half our power.    The other moiety ere you ask is given;    Repeat your will, and take it.  QUEEN KATHARINE. Thank your Majesty.    That you would love yourself, and in that love    Not unconsidered leave your honour nor    The dignity of your office, is the point    Of my petition.  KING. Lady mine, proceed.  QUEEN KATHARINE. I am solicited, not by a few,    And those of true condition, that your subjects    Are in great grievance: there have been commissions    Sent down among 'em which hath flaw'd the heart    Of all their loyalties; wherein, although,    My good Lord Cardinal, they vent reproaches    Most bitterly on you as putter-on    Of these exactions, yet the King our master-    Whose honour Heaven shield from soil!-even he escapes not    Language unmannerly; yea, such which breaks    The sides of loyalty, and almost appears    In loud rebellion.  NORFOLK. Not almost appears-    It doth appear; for, upon these taxations,    The clothiers all, not able to maintain    The many to them 'longing, have put of    The spinsters, carders, fullers, weavers, who    Unfit for other life, compell'd by hunger    And lack of other means, in desperate manner    Daring th' event to th' teeth, are all in uproar,    And danger serves among them.  KING. Taxation!    Wherein? and what taxation? My Lord Cardinal,    You that are blam'd for it alike with us,    Know you of this taxation?  WOLSEY. Please you, sir,    I know but of a single part in aught    Pertains to th' state, and front but in that file    Where others tell steps with me.  QUEEN KATHARINE. No, my lord!    You know no more than others! But you frame    Things that are known alike, which are not wholesome    To those which would not know them, and yet must    Perforce be their acquaintance. These exactions,    Whereof my sovereign would have note, they are    Most pestilent to th' hearing; and to bear 'em    The back is sacrifice to th' load. They say    They are devis'd by you, or else you suffer    Too hard an exclamation.  KING. Still exaction!    The nature of it? In what kind, let's know,    Is this exaction?  QUEEN KATHARINE. I am much too venturous    In tempting of your patience, but am bold'ned    Under your promis'd pardon. The subjects' grief    Comes through commissions, which compels from each    The sixth part of his substance, to be levied    Without delay; and the pretence for this    Is nam'd your wars in France. This makes bold mouths;    Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze    Allegiance in them; their curses now    Live where their prayers did; and it's come to pass    This tractable obedience is a slave    To each incensed will. I would your Highness    Would give it quick consideration, for    There is no primer business.  KING. By my life,    This is against our pleasure.  WOLSEY. And for me,    I have no further gone in this than by    A single voice; and that not pass'd me but    By learned approbation of the judges. If I am    Traduc'd by ignorant tongues, which neither know    My faculties nor person, yet will be    The chronicles of my doing, let me say    'Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake    That virtue must go through. We must not stint    Our necessary actions in the fear    To cope malicious censurers, which ever    As rav'nous fishes do a vessel follow    That is new-trimm'd, but benefit no further    Than vainly longing. What we oft do best,    By sick interpreters, once weak ones, is    Not ours, or not allow'd; what worst, as oft    Hitting a grosser quality, is cried up    For our best act. If we shall stand still,    In fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at,    We should take root here where we sit, or sit    State-statues only.  KING. Things done well    And with a care exempt themselves from fear:    Things done without example, in their issue    Are to be fear'd. Have you a precedent    Of this commission? I believe, not any.    We must not rend our subjects from our laws,    And stick them in our will. Sixth part of each?    A trembling contribution! Why, we take    From every tree lop, bark, and part o' th' timber;    And though we leave it with a root, thus hack'd,    The air will drink the sap. To every county    Where this is question'd send our letters with    Free pardon to each man that has denied    The force of this commission. Pray, look tot;    I put it to your care.  WOLSEY. [Aside to the SECRETARY]  A word with you.    Let there be letters writ to every shire    Of the King's grace and pardon. The grieved commons    Hardly conceive of me-let it be nois'd    That through our intercession this revokement    And pardon comes. I shall anon advise you    Further in the proceeding.                         Exit SECRETARY                    Enter SURVEYOR  QUEEN KATHARINE. I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham    Is run in your displeasure.  KING. It grieves many.    The gentleman is learn'd and a most rare speaker;    To nature none more bound; his training such    That he may furnish and instruct great teachers    And never seek for aid out of himself. Yet see,    When these so noble benefits shall prove    Not well dispos'd, the mind growing once corrupt,    They turn to vicious forms, ten times more ugly    Than ever they were fair. This man so complete,    Who was enroll'd 'mongst wonders, and when we,    Almost with ravish'd list'ning, could not find    His hour of speech a minute-he, my lady,    Hath into monstrous habits put the graces    That once were his, and is become as black    As if besmear'd in hell. Sit by us; you shall hear-    This was his gentleman in trust-of him    Things to strike honour sad. Bid him recount    The fore-recited practices, whereof    We cannot feel too little, hear too much.  WOLSEY. Stand forth, and with bold spirit relate what you,    Most like a careful subject, have collected    Out of the Duke of Buckingham.  KING. Speak freely.  SURVEYOR. First, it was usual with him-every day    It would infect his speech-that if the King    Should without issue die, he'll carry it so    To make the sceptre his. These very words    I've heard him utter to his son-in-law,    Lord Aberga'ny, to whom by oath he menac'd    Revenge upon the Cardinal.  WOLSEY. Please your Highness, note    This dangerous conception in this point:    Not friended by his wish, to your high person    His will is most malignant, and it stretches    Beyond you to your friends.  QUEEN KATHARINE. My learn'd Lord Cardinal,    Deliver all with charity.  KING. Speak on.    How grounded he his title to the crown    Upon our fail? To this point hast thou heard him    At any time speak aught?  SURVEYOR. He was brought to this    By a vain prophecy of Nicholas Henton.  KING. What was that Henton?  SURVEYOR. Sir, a Chartreux friar,    His confessor, who fed him every minute    With words of sovereignty.  KING. How know'st thou this?  SURVEYOR. Not long before your Highness sped to France,    The Duke being at the Rose, within the parish    Saint Lawrence Poultney, did of me demand    What was the speech among the Londoners    Concerning the French journey. I replied    Men fear'd the French would prove perfidious,    To the King's danger. Presently the Duke    Said 'twas the fear indeed and that he doubted    'Twould prove the verity of certain words    Spoke by a holy monk 'that oft' says he    'Hath sent to me, wishing me to permit    John de la Car, my chaplain, a choice hour    To hear from him a matter of some moment;    Whom after under the confession's seal    He solemnly had sworn that what he spoke    My chaplain to no creature living but    To me should utter, with demure confidence    This pausingly ensu'd: "Neither the King nor's heirs,    Tell you the Duke, shall prosper; bid him strive    To gain the love o' th' commonalty; the Duke    Shall govern England."'  QUEEN KATHARINE. If I know you well,    You were the Duke's surveyor, and lost your office    On the complaint o' th' tenants. Take good heed    You charge not in your spleen a noble person    And spoil your nobler soul. I say, take heed;    Yes, heartily beseech you.  KING. Let him on.    Go forward.  SURVEYOR. On my soul, I'll speak but truth.    I told my lord the Duke, by th' devil's illusions    The monk might be deceiv'd, and that 'twas dangerous      for him    To ruminate on this so far, until    It forg'd him some design, which, being believ'd,    It was much like to do. He answer'd 'Tush,    It can do me no damage'; adding further    That, had the King in his last sickness fail'd,    The Cardinal's and Sir Thomas Lovell's heads    Should have gone off.  KING. Ha! what, so rank? Ah ha!    There's mischief in this man. Canst thou say further?  SURVEYOR. I can, my liege.  KING. Proceed.  SURVEYOR. Being at Greenwich,    After your Highness had reprov'd the Duke    About Sir William Bulmer-  KING. I remember    Of such a time: being my sworn servant,    The Duke retain'd him his. But on: what hence?  SURVEYOR. 'If' quoth he 'I for this had been committed-    As to the Tower I thought-I would have play'd    The part my father meant to act upon    Th' usurper Richard; who, being at Salisbury,    Made suit to come in's presence, which if granted,    As he made semblance of his duty, would    Have put his knife into him.'  KING. A giant traitor!  WOLSEY. Now, madam, may his Highness live in freedom,    And this man out of prison?  QUEEN KATHARINE. God mend all!  KING. There's something more would out of thee: what say'st?  SURVEYOR. After 'the Duke his father' with the 'knife,'    He stretch'd him, and, with one hand on his dagger,    Another spread on's breast, mounting his eyes,    He did discharge a horrible oath, whose tenour    Was, were he evil us'd, he would outgo    His father by as much as a performance    Does an irresolute purpose.  KING. There's his period,    To sheath his knife in us. He is attach'd;    Call him to present trial. If he may    Find mercy in the law, 'tis his; if none,    Let him not seek't of us. By day and night!    He's traitor to th' height.                                ExeuntACT I. SCENE 3.London. The palaceEnter the LORD CHAMBERLAIN and LORD SANDYS  CHAMBERLAIN. Is't possible the spells of France should juggle    Men into such strange mysteries?  SANDYS. New customs,    Though they be never so ridiculous,    Nay, let 'em be unmanly, yet are follow'd.  CHAMBERLAIN. As far as I see, all the good our English    Have got by the late voyage is but merely    A fit or two o' th' face; but they are shrewd ones;    For when they hold 'em, you would swear directly    Their very noses had been counsellors    To Pepin or Clotharius, they keep state so.  SANDYS. They have all new legs, and lame ones. One would take it,    That never saw 'em pace before, the spavin    Or springhalt reign'd among 'em.  CHAMBERLAIN. Death! my lord,    Their clothes are after such a pagan cut to't,    That sure th' have worn out Christendom.           Enter SIR THOMAS LOVELL    How now?    What news, Sir Thomas Lovell?  LOVELL. Faith, my lord,    I hear of none but the new proclamation    That's clapp'd upon the court gate.  CHAMBERLAIN. What is't for?  LOVELL. The reformation of our travell'd gallants,    That fill the court with quarrels, talk, and tailors.  CHAMBERLAIN. I am glad 'tis there. Now I would pray our monsieurs    To think an English courtier may be wise,    And never see the Louvre.  LOVELL. They must either,    For so run the conditions, leave those remnants    Of fool and feather that they got in France,    With all their honourable points of ignorance    Pertaining thereunto-as fights and fireworks;    Abusing better men than they can be,    Out of a foreign wisdom-renouncing clean    The faith they have in tennis, and tall stockings,    Short blist'red breeches, and those types of travel    And understand again like honest men,    Or pack to their old playfellows. There, I take it,    They may, cum privilegio, wear away    The lag end of their lewdness and be laugh'd at.  SANDYS. 'Tis time to give 'em physic, their diseases    Are grown so catching.  CHAMBERLAIN. What a loss our ladies    Will have of these trim vanities!  LOVELL. Ay, marry,    There will be woe indeed, lords: the sly whoresons    Have got a speeding trick to lay down ladies.    A French song and a fiddle has no fellow.  SANDYS. The devil fiddle 'em! I am glad they are going,    For sure there's no converting 'em. Now    An honest country lord, as I am, beaten    A long time out of play, may bring his plainsong    And have an hour of hearing; and, by'r Lady,    Held current music too.  CHAMBERLAIN. Well said, Lord Sandys;    Your colt's tooth is not cast yet.  SANDYS. No, my lord,    Nor shall not while I have a stamp.  CHAMBERLAIN. Sir Thomas,    Whither were you a-going?  LOVELL. To the Cardinal's;    Your lordship is a guest too.  CHAMBERLAIN. O, 'tis true;    This night he makes a supper, and a great one,    To many lords and ladies; there will be    The beauty of this kingdom, I'll assure you.  LOVELL. That churchman bears a bounteous mind indeed,    A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us;    His dews fall everywhere.  CHAMBERLAIN. No doubt he's noble;    He had a black mouth that said other of him.  SANDYS. He may, my lord; has wherewithal. In him    Sparing would show a worse sin than ill doctrine:    Men of his way should be most liberal,    They are set here for examples.  CHAMBERLAIN. True, they are so;    But few now give so great ones. My barge stays;    Your lordship shall along. Come, good Sir Thomas,    We shall be late else; which I would not be,    For I was spoke to, with Sir Henry Guildford,    This night to be comptrollers.  SANDYS. I am your lordship's.                                ExeuntACT I. SCENE 4.London. The Presence Chamber in York PlaceHautboys. A small table under a state for the Cardinal,a longer table for the guests. Then enter ANNE BULLEN,and divers other LADIES and GENTLEMEN, as guests, at one door;at another door enter SIR HENRY GUILDFORD  GUILDFORD. Ladies, a general welcome from his Grace    Salutes ye all; this night he dedicates    To fair content and you. None here, he hopes,    In all this noble bevy, has brought with her    One care abroad; he would have all as merry    As, first, good company, good wine, good welcome,    Can make good people.       Enter LORD CHAMBERLAIN, LORD SANDYS, and SIR                  THOMAS LOVELL    O, my lord, y'are tardy,    The very thought of this fair company    Clapp'd wings to me.  CHAMBERLAIN. You are young, Sir Harry Guildford.  SANDYS. Sir Thomas Lovell, had the Cardinal    But half my lay thoughts in him, some of these    Should find a running banquet ere they rested    I think would better please 'em. By my life,    They are a sweet society of fair ones.  LOVELL. O that your lordship were but now confessor    To one or two of these!  SANDYS. I would I were;    They should find easy penance.  LOVELL. Faith, how easy?  SANDYS. As easy as a down bed would afford it.  CHAMBERLAIN. Sweet ladies, will it please you sit? Sir Harry,    Place you that side; I'll take the charge of this.    His Grace is ent'ring. Nay, you must not freeze:    Two women plac'd together makes cold weather.    My Lord Sandys, you are one will keep 'em waking:    Pray sit between these ladies.  SANDYS. By my faith,    And thank your lordship. By your leave, sweet ladies.                 [Seats himself between ANNE BULLEN and another lady]    If I chance to talk a little wild, forgive me;    I had it from my father.  ANNE. Was he mad, sir?  SANDYS. O, very mad, exceeding mad, in love too.    But he would bite none; just as I do now,    He would kiss you twenty with a breath.              [Kisses her]  CHAMBERLAIN. Well said, my lord.    So, now y'are fairly seated. Gentlemen,    The penance lies on you if these fair ladies    Pass away frowning.  SANDYS. For my little cure,    Let me alone.         Hautboys. Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, attended; and                         takes his state  WOLSEY. Y'are welcome, my fair guests. That noble lady    Or gentleman that is not freely merry    Is not my friend. This, to confirm my welcome-    And to you all, good health!                             [Drinks]  SANDYS. Your Grace is noble.    Let me have such a bowl may hold my thanks    And save me so much talking.  WOLSEY. My Lord Sandys,    I am beholding to you. Cheer your neighbours.    Ladies, you are not merry. Gentlemen,    Whose fault is this?  SANDYS. The red wine first must rise    In their fair cheeks, my lord; then we shall have 'em    Talk us to silence.  ANNE. You are a merry gamester,    My Lord Sandys.  SANDYS. Yes, if I make my play.    Here's to your ladyship; and pledge it, madam,    For 'tis to such a thing-  ANNE. You cannot show me.  SANDYS. I told your Grace they would talk anon.                             [Drum and trumpet. Chambers discharg'd]  WOLSEY. What's that?  CHAMBERLAIN. Look out there, some of ye.             Exit a SERVANT  WOLSEY. What warlike voice,    And to what end, is this? Nay, ladies, fear not:    By all the laws of war y'are privileg'd.            Re-enter SERVANT  CHAMBERLAIN. How now! what is't?  SERVANT. A noble troop of strangers-    For so they seem. Th' have left their barge and landed,    And hither make, as great ambassadors    From foreign princes.  WOLSEY. Good Lord Chamberlain,    Go, give 'em welcome; you can speak the French tongue;    And pray receive 'em nobly and conduct 'em    Into our presence, where this heaven of beauty    Shall shine at full upon them. Some attend him.              Exit CHAMBERLAIN attended. All rise, and tables remov'd    You have now a broken banquet, but we'll mend it.    A good digestion to you all; and once more    I show'r a welcome on ye; welcome all.      Hautboys. Enter the KING, and others, as maskers,      habited like shepherds, usher'd by the LORD CHAMBERLAIN.      They pass directly before the CARDINAL,      and gracefully salute him    A noble company! What are their pleasures?  CHAMBERLAIN. Because they speak no English, thus they pray'd    To tell your Grace, that, having heard by fame    Of this so noble and so fair assembly    This night to meet here, they could do no less,    Out of the great respect they bear to beauty,    But leave their flocks and, under your fair conduct,    Crave leave to view these ladies and entreat    An hour of revels with 'em.  WOLSEY. Say, Lord Chamberlain,    They have done my poor house grace; for which I pay 'em    A thousand thanks, and pray 'em take their pleasures.                   [They choose ladies. The KING chooses ANNE BULLEN]  KING. The fairest hand I ever touch'd! O beauty,    Till now I never knew thee!                        [Music. Dance]  WOLSEY. My lord!  CHAMBERLAIN. Your Grace?  WOLSEY. Pray tell 'em thus much from me:    There should be one amongst 'em, by his person,    More worthy this place than myself; to whom,    If I but knew him, with my love and duty    I would surrender it.  CHAMBERLAIN. I will, my lord.                                         [He whispers to the maskers]  WOLSEY. What say they?  CHAMBERLAIN. Such a one, they all confess,    There is indeed; which they would have your Grace    Find out, and he will take it.  WOLSEY. Let me see, then.                    [Comes from his state]    By all your good leaves, gentlemen, here I'll make    My royal choice.  KING.  [Unmasking]  Ye have found him, Cardinal.    You hold a fair assembly; you do well, lord.    You are a churchman, or, I'll tell you, Cardinal,    I should judge now unhappily.  WOLSEY. I am glad    Your Grace is grown so pleasant.  KING. My Lord Chamberlain,    Prithee come hither: what fair lady's that?  CHAMBERLAIN. An't please your Grace, Sir Thomas Bullen's      daughter-    The Viscount Rochford-one of her Highness' women.  KING. By heaven, she is a dainty one. Sweet heart,    I were unmannerly to take you out    And not to kiss you. A health, gentlemen!    Let it go round.  WOLSEY. Sir Thomas Lovell, is the banquet ready    I' th' privy chamber?  LOVELL. Yes, my lord.  WOLSEY. Your Grace,    I fear, with dancing is a little heated.  KING. I fear, too much.  WOLSEY. There's fresher air, my lord,    In the next chamber.  KING. Lead in your ladies, ev'ry one. Sweet partner,    I must not yet forsake you. Let's be merry:    Good my Lord Cardinal, I have half a dozen healths    To drink to these fair ladies, and a measure    To lead 'em once again; and then let's dream    Who's best in favour. Let the music knock it.                                                Exeunt, with trumpetsACT II. SCENE 1.Westminster. A streetEnter two GENTLEMEN, at several doors  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Whither away so fast?  SECOND GENTLEMAN. O, God save ye!    Ev'n to the Hall, to hear what shall become    Of the great Duke of Buckingham.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. I'll save you    That labour, sir. All's now done but the ceremony    Of bringing back the prisoner.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Were you there?  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Yes, indeed, was I.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Pray, speak what has happen'd.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. You may guess quickly what.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Is he found guilty?  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Yes, truly is he, and condemn'd upon't.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. I am sorry for't.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. So are a number more.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. But, pray, how pass'd it?  FIRST GENTLEMAN. I'll tell you in a little. The great Duke.    Came to the bar; where to his accusations    He pleaded still not guilty, and alleged    Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.    The King's attorney, on the contrary,    Urg'd on the examinations, proofs, confessions,    Of divers witnesses; which the Duke desir'd    To have brought, viva voce, to his face;    At which appear'd against him his surveyor,    Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor, and John Car,    Confessor to him, with that devil-monk,    Hopkins, that made this mischief.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. That was he    That fed him with his prophecies?  FIRST GENTLEMAN. The same.    All these accus'd him strongly, which he fain    Would have flung from him; but indeed he could not;    And so his peers, upon this evidence,    Have found him guilty of high treason. Much    He spoke, and learnedly, for life; but all    Was either pitied in him or forgotten.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. After all this, how did he bear him-self  FIRST GENTLEMAN. When he was brought again to th' bar to hear    His knell rung out, his judgment, he was stirr'd    With such an agony he sweat extremely,    And something spoke in choler, ill and hasty;    But he fell to himself again, and sweetly    In all the rest show'd a most noble patience.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. I do not think he fears death.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Sure, he does not;    He never was so womanish; the cause    He may a little grieve at.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Certainly    The Cardinal is the end of this.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. 'Tis likely,    By all conjectures: first, Kildare's attainder,    Then deputy of Ireland, who remov'd,    Earl Surrey was sent thither, and in haste too,    Lest he should help his father.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. That trick of state    Was a deep envious one.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. At his return    No doubt he will requite it. This is noted,    And generally: whoever the King favours    The Cardinal instantly will find employment,    And far enough from court too.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. All the commons    Hate him perniciously, and, o' my conscience,    Wish him ten fathom deep: this Duke as much    They love and dote on; call him bounteous Buckingham,    The mirror of all courtesy-      Enter BUCKINGHAM from his arraignment, tip-staves      before him; the axe with the edge towards him; halberds      on each side; accompanied with SIR THOMAS      LOVELL, SIR NICHOLAS VAUX, SIR WILLIAM SANDYS,      and common people, etc.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Stay there, sir,    And see the noble ruin'd man you speak of.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Let's stand close, and behold him.  BUCKINGHAM. All good people,    You that thus far have come to pity me,    Hear what I say, and then go home and lose me.    I have this day receiv'd a traitor's judgment,    And by that name must die; yet, heaven bear witness,    And if I have a conscience, let it sink me    Even as the axe falls, if I be not faithful!    The law I bear no malice for my death:    'T has done, upon the premises, but justice.    But those that sought it I could wish more Christians.    Be what they will, I heartily forgive 'em;    Yet let 'em look they glory not in mischief    Nor build their evils on the graves of great men,    For then my guiltless blood must cry against 'em.    For further life in this world I ne'er hope    Nor will I sue, although the King have mercies    More than I dare make faults. You few that lov'd me    And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,    His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave    Is only bitter to him, only dying,    Go with me like good angels to my end;    And as the long divorce of steel falls on me    Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice,    And lift my soul to heaven. Lead on, a God's name.  LOVELL. I do beseech your Grace, for charity,    If ever any malice in your heart    Were hid against me, now to forgive me frankly.  BUCKINGHAM. Sir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive you    As I would be forgiven. I forgive all.    There cannot be those numberless offences    'Gainst me that I cannot take peace with. No black envy    Shall mark my grave. Commend me to his Grace;    And if he speak of Buckingham, pray tell him    You met him half in heaven. My vows and prayers    Yet are the King's, and, till my soul forsake,    Shall cry for blessings on him. May he live    Longer than I have time to tell his years;    Ever belov'd and loving may his rule be;    And when old time Shall lead him to his end,    Goodness and he fill up one monument!  LOVELL. To th' water side I must conduct your Grace;    Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux,    Who undertakes you to your end.  VAUX. Prepare there;    The Duke is coming; see the barge be ready;    And fit it with such furniture as suits    The greatness of his person.  BUCKINGHAM. Nay, Sir Nicholas,    Let it alone; my state now will but mock me.    When I came hither I was Lord High Constable    And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun.    Yet I am richer than my base accusers    That never knew what truth meant; I now seal it;    And with that blood will make 'em one day groan fort.    My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,    Who first rais'd head against usurping Richard,    Flying for succour to his servant Banister,    Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd    And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!    Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying    My father's loss, like a most royal prince,    Restor'd me to my honours, and out of ruins    Made my name once more noble. Now his son,    Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name, and all    That made me happy, at one stroke has taken    For ever from the world. I had my trial,    And must needs say a noble one; which makes me    A little happier than my wretched father;    Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both    Fell by our servants, by those men we lov'd most-    A most unnatural and faithless service.    Heaven has an end in all. Yet, you that hear me,    This from a dying man receive as certain:    Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels,    Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends    And give your hearts to, when they once perceive    The least rub in your fortunes, fall away    Like water from ye, never found again    But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,    Pray for me! I must now forsake ye; the last hour    Of my long weary life is come upon me.    Farewell;    And when you would say something that is sad,    Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!                                          Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and train  FIRST GENTLEMAN. O, this is full of pity! Sir, it calls,    I fear, too many curses on their heads    That were the authors.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. If the Duke be guiltless,    'Tis full of woe; yet I can give you inkling    Of an ensuing evil, if it fall,    Greater than this.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Good angels keep it from us!    What may it be? You do not doubt my faith, sir?  SECOND GENTLEMAN. This secret is so weighty, 'twill require    A strong faith to conceal it.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Let me have it;    I do not talk much.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. I am confident.    You shall, sir. Did you not of late days hear    A buzzing of a separation    Between the King and Katharine?  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Yes, but it held not;    For when the King once heard it, out of anger    He sent command to the Lord Mayor straight    To stop the rumour and allay those tongues    That durst disperse it.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. But that slander, sir,    Is found a truth now; for it grows again    Fresher than e'er it was, and held for certain    The King will venture at it. Either the Cardinal    Or some about him near have, out of malice    To the good Queen, possess'd him with a scruple    That will undo her. To confirm this too,    Cardinal Campeius is arriv'd and lately;    As all think, for this business.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. 'Tis the Cardinal;    And merely to revenge him on the Emperor    For not bestowing on him at his asking    The archbishopric of Toledo, this is purpos'd.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. I think you have hit the mark; but is't        not cruel    That she should feel the smart of this? The Cardinal    Will have his will, and she must fall.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. 'Tis woeful.    We are too open here to argue this;    Let's think in private more.                               ExeuntACT II. SCENE 2.London. The palaceEnter the LORD CHAMBERLAIN reading this letter  CHAMBERLAIN. 'My lord,    'The horses your lordship sent for, with all the care    had, I saw well chosen, ridden, and furnish'd. They were    young and handsome, and of the best breed in the north.    When they were ready to set out for London, a man of    my Lord Cardinal's, by commission, and main power, took    'em from me, with this reason: his master would be serv'd    before a subject, if not before the King; which stopp'd    our mouths, sir.'    I fear he will indeed. Well, let him have them.    He will have all, I think.    Enter to the LORD CHAMBERLAIN the DUKES OF NORFOLK and SUFFOLK  NORFOLK. Well met, my Lord Chamberlain.  CHAMBERLAIN. Good day to both your Graces.  SUFFOLK. How is the King employ'd?  CHAMBERLAIN. I left him private,    Full of sad thoughts and troubles.  NORFOLK. What's the cause?  CHAMBERLAIN. It seems the marriage with his brother's wife    Has crept too near his conscience.  SUFFOLK. No, his conscience    Has crept too near another lady.  NORFOLK. 'Tis so;    This is the Cardinal's doing; the King-Cardinal,    That blind priest, like the eldest son of fortune,    Turns what he list. The King will know him one day.  SUFFOLK. Pray God he do! He'll never know himself else.  NORFOLK. How holily he works in all his business!    And with what zeal! For, now he has crack'd the league    Between us and the Emperor, the Queen's great nephew,    He dives into the King's soul and there scatters    Dangers, doubts, wringing of the conscience,    Fears, and despairs-and all these for his marriage;    And out of all these to restore the King,    He counsels a divorce, a loss of her    That like a jewel has hung twenty years    About his neck, yet never lost her lustre;    Of her that loves him with that excellence    That angels love good men with; even of her    That, when the greatest stroke of fortune falls,    Will bless the King-and is not this course pious?  CHAMBERLAIN. Heaven keep me from such counsel! 'Tis most true    These news are everywhere; every tongue speaks 'em,    And every true heart weeps for 't. All that dare    Look into these affairs see this main end-    The French King's sister. Heaven will one day open    The King's eyes, that so long have slept upon    This bold bad man.  SUFFOLK. And free us from his slavery.  NORFOLK. We had need pray, and heartily, for our deliverance;    Or this imperious man will work us an    From princes into pages. All men's honours    Lie like one lump before him, to be fashion'd    Into what pitch he please.  SUFFOLK. For me, my lords,    I love him not, nor fear him-there's my creed;    As I am made without him, so I'll stand,    If the King please; his curses and his blessings    Touch me alike; th' are breath I not believe in.    I knew him, and I know him; so I leave him    To him that made him proud-the Pope.  NORFOLK. Let's in;    And with some other business put the King    From these sad thoughts that work too much upon him.    My lord, you'll bear us company?  CHAMBERLAIN. Excuse me,    The King has sent me otherwhere; besides,    You'll find a most unfit time to disturb him.    Health to your lordships!  NORFOLK. Thanks, my good Lord Chamberlain.                            Exit LORD CHAMBERLAIN; and the KING draws                               the curtain and sits reading pensively  SUFFOLK. How sad he looks; sure, he is much afflicted.  KING. Who's there, ha?  NORFOLK. Pray God he be not angry.  KING HENRY. Who's there, I say? How dare you thrust yourselves    Into my private meditations?    Who am I, ha?  NORFOLK. A gracious king that pardons all offences    Malice ne'er meant. Our breach of duty this way    Is business of estate, in which we come    To know your royal pleasure.  KING. Ye are too bold.    Go to; I'll make ye know your times of business.    Is this an hour for temporal affairs, ha?      Enter WOLSEY and CAMPEIUS with a commission    Who's there? My good Lord Cardinal? O my Wolsey,    The quiet of my wounded conscience,    Thou art a cure fit for a King.  [To CAMPEIUS]  You're      welcome,    Most learned reverend sir, into our kingdom.    Use us and it.  [To WOLSEY]  My good lord, have great care    I be not found a talker.  WOLSEY. Sir, you cannot.    I would your Grace would give us but an hour    Of private conference.  KING.  [To NORFOLK and SUFFOLK]  We are busy; go.  NORFOLK.  [Aside to SUFFOLK]  This priest has no pride in him!  SUFFOLK.  [Aside to NORFOLK]  Not to speak of!    I would not be so sick though for his place.    But this cannot continue.  NORFOLK.  [Aside to SUFFOLK]  If it do,    I'll venture one have-at-him.  SUFFOLK.  [Aside to NORFOLK]  I another.                                           Exeunt NORFOLK and SUFFOLK  WOLSEY. Your Grace has given a precedent of wisdom    Above all princes, in committing freely    Your scruple to the voice of Christendom.    Who can be angry now? What envy reach you?    The Spaniard, tied by blood and favour to her,    Must now confess, if they have any goodness,    The trial just and noble. All the clerks,    I mean the learned ones, in Christian kingdoms    Have their free voices. Rome the nurse of judgment,    Invited by your noble self, hath sent    One general tongue unto us, this good man,    This just and learned priest, Cardinal Campeius,    Whom once more I present unto your Highness.  KING. And once more in mine arms I bid him welcome,    And thank the holy conclave for their loves.    They have sent me such a man I would have wish'd for.  CAMPEIUS. Your Grace must needs deserve an strangers' loves,    You are so noble. To your Highness' hand    I tender my commission; by whose virtue-    The court of Rome commanding-you, my Lord    Cardinal of York, are join'd with me their servant    In the unpartial judging of this business.  KING. Two equal men. The Queen shall be acquainted    Forthwith for what you come. Where's Gardiner?  WOLSEY. I know your Majesty has always lov'd her    So dear in heart not to deny her that    A woman of less place might ask by law-    Scholars allow'd freely to argue for her.  KING. Ay, and the best she shall have; and my favour    To him that does best. God forbid else. Cardinal,    Prithee call Gardiner to me, my new secretary;    I find him a fit fellow.                              Exit WOLSEY          Re-enter WOLSEY with GARDINER  WOLSEY.  [Aside to GARDINER]  Give me your hand: much      joy and favour to you;    You are the King's now.  GARDINER.  [Aside to WOLSEY]  But to be commanded    For ever by your Grace, whose hand has rais'd me.  KING. Come hither, Gardiner.                   [Walks and whispers]  CAMPEIUS. My Lord of York, was not one Doctor Pace    In this man's place before him?  WOLSEY. Yes, he was.  CAMPEIUS. Was he not held a learned man?  WOLSEY. Yes, surely.  CAMPEIUS. Believe me, there's an ill opinion spread then,    Even of yourself, Lord Cardinal.  WOLSEY. How! Of me?  CAMPEIUS. They will not stick to say you envied him    And, fearing he would rise, he was so virtuous,    Kept him a foreign man still; which so griev'd him    That he ran mad and died.  WOLSEY. Heav'n's peace be with him!    That's Christian care enough. For living murmurers    There's places of rebuke. He was a fool,    For he would needs be virtuous: that good fellow,    If I command him, follows my appointment.    I will have none so near else. Learn this, brother,    We live not to be grip'd by meaner persons.  KING. Deliver this with modesty to th' Queen.                                                        Exit GARDINER    The most convenient place that I can think of    For such receipt of learning is Blackfriars;    There ye shall meet about this weighty business-    My Wolsey, see it furnish'd. O, my lord,    Would it not grieve an able man to leave    So sweet a bedfellow? But, conscience, conscience!    O, 'tis a tender place! and I must leave her.              ExeuntACT II. SCENE 3.London. The palaceEnter ANNE BULLEN and an OLD LADY  ANNE. Not for that neither. Here's the pang that pinches:    His Highness having liv'd so long with her, and she    So good a lady that no tongue could ever    Pronounce dishonour of her-by my life,    She never knew harm-doing-O, now, after    So many courses of the sun enthroned,    Still growing in a majesty and pomp, the which    To leave a thousand-fold more bitter than    'Tis sweet at first t' acquire-after this process,    To give her the avaunt, it is a pity    Would move a monster.  OLD LADY. Hearts of most hard temper    Melt and lament for her.  ANNE. O, God's will! much better    She ne'er had known pomp; though't be temporal,    Yet, if that quarrel, fortune, do divorce    It from the bearer, 'tis a sufferance panging    As soul and body's severing.  OLD LADY. Alas, poor lady!    She's a stranger now again.  ANNE. So much the more    Must pity drop upon her. Verily,    I swear 'tis better to be lowly born    And range with humble livers in content    Than to be perk'd up in a glist'ring grief    And wear a golden sorrow.  OLD LADY. Our content    Is our best having.  ANNE. By my troth and maidenhead,    I would not be a queen.  OLD LADY. Beshrew me, I would,    And venture maidenhead for 't; and so would you,    For all this spice of your hypocrisy.    You that have so fair parts of woman on you    Have too a woman's heart, which ever yet    Affected eminence, wealth, sovereignty;    Which, to say sooth, are blessings; and which gifts,    Saving your mincing, the capacity    Of your soft cheveril conscience would receive    If you might please to stretch it.  ANNE. Nay, good troth.  OLD LADY. Yes, troth and troth. You would not be a queen!  ANNE. No, not for all the riches under heaven.  OLD LADY. 'Tis strange: a threepence bow'd would hire me,    Old as I am, to queen it. But, I pray you,    What think you of a duchess? Have you limbs    To bear that load of title?  ANNE. No, in truth.  OLD LADY. Then you are weakly made. Pluck off a little;    I would not be a young count in your way    For more than blushing comes to. If your back    Cannot vouchsafe this burden, 'tis too weak    Ever to get a boy.  ANNE. How you do talk!    I swear again I would not be a queen    For all the world.  OLD LADY. In faith, for little England    You'd venture an emballing. I myself    Would for Carnarvonshire, although there long'd    No more to th' crown but that. Lo, who comes here?         Enter the LORD CHAMBERLAIN  CHAMBERLAIN. Good morrow, ladies. What were't worth to know    The secret of your conference?  ANNE. My good lord,    Not your demand; it values not your asking.    Our mistress' sorrows we were pitying.  CHAMBERLAIN. It was a gentle business and becoming    The action of good women; there is hope    All will be well.  ANNE. Now, I pray God, amen!  CHAMBERLAIN. You bear a gentle mind, and heav'nly blessings    Follow such creatures. That you may, fair lady,    Perceive I speak sincerely and high notes    Ta'en of your many virtues, the King's Majesty    Commends his good opinion of you to you, and    Does purpose honour to you no less flowing    Than Marchioness of Pembroke; to which tide    A thousand pound a year, annual support,    Out of his grace he adds.  ANNE. I do not know    What kind of my obedience I should tender;    More than my all is nothing, nor my prayers    Are not words duly hallowed, nor my wishes    More worth than empty vanities; yet prayers and wishes    Are all I can return. Beseech your lordship,    Vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience,    As from a blushing handmaid, to his Highness;    Whose health and royalty I pray for.  CHAMBERLAIN. Lady,    I shall not fail t' approve the fair conceit    The King hath of you.  [Aside]  I have perus'd her well:    Beauty and honour in her are so mingled    That they have caught the King; and who knows yet    But from this lady may proceed a gem    To lighten all this isle?-I'll to the King    And say I spoke with you.  ANNE. My honour'd lord!                       Exit LORD CHAMBERLAIN  OLD LADY. Why, this it is: see, see!    I have been begging sixteen years in court-    Am yet a courtier beggarly-nor could    Come pat betwixt too early and too late    For any suit of pounds; and you, O fate!    A very fresh-fish here-fie, fie, fie upon    This compell'd fortune!-have your mouth fill'd up    Before you open it.  ANNE. This is strange to me.  OLD LADY. How tastes it? Is it bitter? Forty pence, no.    There was a lady once-'tis an old story-    That would not be a queen, that would she not,    For all the mud in Egypt. Have you heard it?  ANNE. Come, you are pleasant.  OLD LADY. With your theme I could    O'ermount the lark. The Marchioness of Pembroke!    A thousand pounds a year for pure respect!    No other obligation! By my life,    That promises moe thousands: honour's train    Is longer than his foreskirt. By this time    I know your back will bear a duchess. Say,    Are you not stronger than you were?  ANNE. Good lady,    Make yourself mirth with your particular fancy,    And leave me out on't. Would I had no being,    If this salute my blood a jot; it faints me    To think what follows.    The Queen is comfortless, and we forgetful    In our long absence. Pray, do not deliver    What here y' have heard to her.  OLD LADY. What do you think me?                              ExeuntACT II. SCENE 4.London. A hall in BlackfriarsTrumpets, sennet, and cornets. Enter two VERGERS, with short silver wands;next them, two SCRIBES, in the habit of doctors; after them,the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY alone; after him, the BISHOPS OF LINCOLN, ELY,ROCHESTER, and SAINT ASAPH; next them, with some small distance,follows a GENTLEMAN bearing the purse, with the great seal,and a Cardinal's hat; then two PRIESTS, bearing each silver cross;then a GENTLEMAN USHER bareheaded, accompanied with a SERGEANT-AT-ARMSbearing a silver mace; then two GENTLEMEN bearing two great silver pillars;after them, side by side, the two CARDINALS, WOLSEY and CAMPEIUS;two NOBLEMEN with the sword and mace. Then enter the KING and QUEENand their trains. The KING takes place under the cloth of state;the two CARDINALS sit under him as judges. The QUEEN takes placesome distance from the KING. The BISHOPS place themselves on each sideof the court, in manner of consistory; below them the SCRIBES.The LORDS sit next the BISHOPS. The rest of the attendants standin convenient order about the stage  WOLSEY. Whilst our commission from Rome is read,    Let silence be commanded.  KING. What's the need?    It hath already publicly been read,    And on all sides th' authority allow'd;    You may then spare that time.  WOLSEY. Be't so; proceed.  SCRIBE. Say 'Henry King of England, come into the court.'  CRIER. Henry King of England, &c.  KING. Here.  SCRIBE. Say 'Katharine Queen of England, come into the court.'  CRIER. Katharine Queen of England, &c.     The QUEEN makes no answer, rises out of her chair,     goes about the court, comes to the KING, and kneels     at his feet; then speaks  QUEEN KATHARINE. Sir, I desire you do me right and justice,    And to bestow your pity on me; for    I am a most poor woman and a stranger,    Born out of your dominions, having here    No judge indifferent, nor no more assurance    Of equal friendship and proceeding. Alas, sir,    In what have I offended you? What cause    Hath my behaviour given to your displeasure    That thus you should proceed to put me of    And take your good grace from me? Heaven witness,    I have been to you a true and humble wife,    At all times to your will conformable,    Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,    Yea, subject to your countenance-glad or sorry    As I saw it inclin'd. When was the hour    I ever contradicted your desire    Or made it not mine too? Or which of your friends    Have I not strove to love, although I knew    He were mine enemy? What friend of mine    That had to him deriv'd your anger did    Continue in my liking? Nay, gave notice    He was from thence discharg'd? Sir, call to mind    That I have been your wife in this obedience    Upward of twenty years, and have been blest    With many children by you. If, in the course    And process of this time, you can report,    And prove it too against mine honour, aught,    My bond to wedlock or my love and duty,    Against your sacred person, in God's name,    Turn me away and let the foul'st contempt    Shut door upon me, and so give me up    To the sharp'st kind of justice. Please you, sir,    The King, your father, was reputed for    A prince most prudent, of an excellent    And unmatch'd wit and judgment; Ferdinand,    My father, King of Spain, was reckon'd one    The wisest prince that there had reign'd by many    A year before. It is not to be question'd    That they had gather'd a wise council to them    Of every realm, that did debate this business,    Who deem'd our marriage lawful. Wherefore I humbly    Beseech you, sir, to spare me till I may    Be by my friends in Spain advis'd, whose counsel    I will implore. If not, i' th' name of God,    Your pleasure be fulfill'd!  WOLSEY. You have here, lady,    And of your choice, these reverend fathers-men    Of singular integrity and learning,    Yea, the elect o' th' land, who are assembled    To plead your cause. It shall be therefore bootless    That longer you desire the court, as well    For your own quiet as to rectify    What is unsettled in the King.  CAMPEIUS. His Grace    Hath spoken well and justly; therefore, madam,    It's fit this royal session do proceed    And that, without delay, their arguments    Be now produc'd and heard.  QUEEN KATHARINE. Lord Cardinal,    To you I speak.  WOLSEY. Your pleasure, madam?  QUEEN KATHARINE. Sir,    I am about to weep; but, thinking that    We are a queen, or long have dream'd so, certain    The daughter of a king, my drops of tears    I'll turn to sparks of fire.  WOLSEY. Be patient yet.  QUEEN KATHARINE. I Will, when you are humble; nay, before    Or God will punish me. I do believe,    Induc'd by potent circumstances, that    You are mine enemy, and make my challenge    You shall not be my judge; for it is you    Have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me-    Which God's dew quench! Therefore I say again,    I utterly abhor, yea, from my soul    Refuse you for my judge, whom yet once more    I hold my most malicious foe and think not    At all a friend to truth.  WOLSEY. I do profess    You speak not like yourself, who ever yet    Have stood to charity and display'd th' effects    Of disposition gentle and of wisdom    O'ertopping woman's pow'r. Madam, you do me wrong:    I have no spleen against you, nor injustice    For you or any; how far I have proceeded,    Or how far further shall, is warranted    By a commission from the Consistory,    Yea, the whole Consistory of Rome. You charge me    That I have blown this coal: I do deny it.    The King is present; if it be known to him    That I gainsay my deed, how may he wound,    And worthily, my falsehood! Yea, as much    As you have done my truth. If he know    That I am free of your report, he knows    I am not of your wrong. Therefore in him    It lies to cure me, and the cure is to    Remove these thoughts from you; the which before    His Highness shall speak in, I do beseech    You, gracious madam, to unthink your speaking    And to say so no more.  QUEEN KATHARINE. My lord, my lord,    I am a simple woman, much too weak    T' oppose your cunning. Y'are meek and humble-mouth'd;    You sign your place and calling, in full seeming,    With meekness and humility; but your heart    Is cramm'd with arrogancy, spleen, and pride.    You have, by fortune and his Highness' favours,    Gone slightly o'er low steps, and now are mounted    Where pow'rs are your retainers, and your words,    Domestics to you, serve your will as't please    Yourself pronounce their office. I must tell you    You tender more your person's honour than    Your high profession spiritual; that again    I do refuse you for my judge and here,    Before you all, appeal unto the Pope,    To bring my whole cause 'fore his Holiness    And to be judg'd by him.                     [She curtsies to the KING, and offers to depart]  CAMPEIUS. The Queen is obstinate,    Stubborn to justice, apt to accuse it, and    Disdainful to be tried by't; 'tis not well.    She's going away.  KING. Call her again.  CRIER. Katharine Queen of England, come into the court.  GENTLEMAN USHER. Madam, you are call'd back.  QUEEN KATHARINE. What need you note it? Pray you keep your way;    When you are call'd, return. Now the Lord help!    They vex me past my patience. Pray you pass on.    I will not tarry; no, nor ever more    Upon this business my appearance make    In any of their courts.           Exeunt QUEEN and her attendants  KING. Go thy ways, Kate.    That man i' th' world who shall report he has    A better wife, let him in nought be trusted    For speaking false in that. Thou art, alone-    If thy rare qualities, sweet gentleness,    Thy meekness saint-like, wife-like government,    Obeying in commanding, and thy parts    Sovereign and pious else, could speak thee out-    The queen of earthly queens. She's noble born;    And like her true nobility she has    Carried herself towards me.  WOLSEY. Most gracious sir,    In humblest manner I require your Highness    That it shall please you to declare in hearing    Of all these ears-for where I am robb'd and bound,    There must I be unloos'd, although not there    At once and fully satisfied-whether ever I    Did broach this business to your Highness, or    Laid any scruple in your way which might    Induce you to the question on't, or ever    Have to you, but with thanks to God for such    A royal lady, spake one the least word that might    Be to the prejudice of her present state,    Or touch of her good person?  KING. My Lord Cardinal,    I do excuse you; yea, upon mine honour,    I free you from't. You are not to be taught    That you have many enemies that know not    Why they are so, but, like to village curs,    Bark when their fellows do. By some of these    The Queen is put in anger. Y'are excus'd.    But will you be more justified? You ever    Have wish'd the sleeping of this business; never desir'd    It to be stirr'd; but oft have hind'red, oft,    The passages made toward it. On my honour,    I speak my good Lord Cardinal to this point,    And thus far clear him. Now, what mov'd me to't,    I will be bold with time and your attention.    Then mark th' inducement. Thus it came-give heed to't:    My conscience first receiv'd a tenderness,    Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter'd    By th' Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador,    Who had been hither sent on the debating    A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and    Our daughter Mary. I' th' progress of this business,    Ere a determinate resolution, he-    I mean the Bishop-did require a respite    Wherein he might the King his lord advertise    Whether our daughter were legitimate,    Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,    Sometimes our brother's wife. This respite shook    The bosom of my conscience, enter'd me,    Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble    The region of my breast, which forc'd such way    That many maz'd considerings did throng    And press'd in with this caution. First, methought    I stood not in the smile of heaven, who had    Commanded nature that my lady's womb,    If it conceiv'd a male child by me, should    Do no more offices of life to't than    The grave does to the dead; for her male issue    Or died where they were made, or shortly after    This world had air'd them. Hence I took a thought    This was a judgment on me, that my kingdom,    Well worthy the best heir o' th' world, should not    Be gladded in't by me. Then follows that    I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in    By this my issue's fail, and that gave to me    Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in    The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer    Toward this remedy, whereupon we are    Now present here together; that's to say    I meant to rectify my conscience, which    I then did feel full sick, and yet not well,    By all the reverend fathers of the land    And doctors learn'd. First, I began in private    With you, my Lord of Lincoln; you remember    How under my oppression I did reek,    When I first mov'd you.  LINCOLN. Very well, my liege.  KING. I have spoke long; be pleas'd yourself to say    How far you satisfied me.  LINCOLN. So please your Highness,    The question did at first so stagger me-    Bearing a state of mighty moment in't    And consequence of dread-that I committed    The daring'st counsel which I had to doubt,    And did entreat your Highness to this course    Which you are running here.  KING. I then mov'd you,    My Lord of Canterbury, and got your leave    To make this present summons. Unsolicited    I left no reverend person in this court,    But by particular consent proceeded    Under your hands and seals; therefore, go on,    For no dislike i' th' world against the person    Of the good Queen, but the sharp thorny points    Of my alleged reasons, drives this forward.    Prove but our marriage lawful, by my life    And kingly dignity, we are contented    To wear our moral state to come with her,    Katharine our queen, before the primest creature    That's paragon'd o' th' world.  CAMPEIUS. So please your Highness,    The Queen being absent, 'tis a needful fitness    That we adjourn this court till further day;    Meanwhile must be an earnest motion    Made to the Queen to call back her appeal    She intends unto his Holiness.  KING.  [Aside]  I may perceive    These cardinals trifle with me. I abhor    This dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome.    My learn'd and well-beloved servant, Cranmer,    Prithee return. With thy approach I know    My comfort comes along. -Break up the court;    I say, set on.                   Exuent in manner as they enteredACT III. SCENE 1.London. The QUEEN'S apartmentsEnter the QUEEN and her women, as at work  QUEEN KATHARINE. Take thy lute, wench. My soul grows      sad with troubles;    Sing and disperse 'em, if thou canst. Leave working.                    SONG        Orpheus with his lute made trees,        And the mountain tops that freeze,          Bow themselves when he did sing;        To his music plants and flowers        Ever sprung, as sun and showers          There had made a lasting spring.        Every thing that heard him play,        Even the billows of the sea,          Hung their heads and then lay by.        In sweet music is such art,        Killing care and grief of heart          Fall asleep or hearing die.              Enter a GENTLEMAN  QUEEN KATHARINE. How now?  GENTLEMAN. An't please your Grace, the two great Cardinals    Wait in the presence.  QUEEN KATHARINE. Would they speak with me?  GENTLEMAN. They will'd me say so, madam.  QUEEN KATHARINE. Pray their Graces    To come near. [Exit GENTLEMAN] What can be their business    With me, a poor weak woman, fall'n from favour?    I do not like their coming. Now I think on't,    They should be good men, their affairs as righteous;    But all hoods make not monks.         Enter the two CARDINALS, WOLSEY and CAMPEIUS  WOLSEY. Peace to your Highness!  QUEEN KATHARINE. Your Graces find me here part of housewife;    I would be all, against the worst may happen.    What are your pleasures with me, reverend lords?  WOLSEY. May it please you, noble madam, to withdraw    Into your private chamber, we shall give you    The full cause of our coming.  QUEEN KATHARINE. Speak it here;    There's nothing I have done yet, o' my conscience,    Deserves a corner. Would all other women    Could speak this with as free a soul as I do!    My lords, I care not-so much I am happy    Above a number-if my actions    Were tried by ev'ry tongue, ev'ry eye saw 'em,    Envy and base opinion set against 'em,    I know my life so even. If your business    Seek me out, and that way I am wife in,    Out with it boldly; truth loves open dealing.  WOLSEY. Tanta est erga te mentis integritas, regina serenis-sima-  QUEEN KATHARINE. O, good my lord, no Latin!    I am not such a truant since my coming,    As not to know the language I have liv'd in;    A strange tongue makes my cause more strange, suspicious;    Pray speak in English. Here are some will thank you,    If you speak truth, for their poor mistress' sake:    Believe me, she has had much wrong. Lord Cardinal,    The willing'st sin I ever yet committed    May be absolv'd in English.  WOLSEY. Noble lady,    I am sorry my integrity should breed,    And service to his Majesty and you,    So deep suspicion, where all faith was meant    We come not by the way of accusation    To taint that honour every good tongue blesses,    Nor to betray you any way to sorrow-    You have too much, good lady; but to know    How you stand minded in the weighty difference    Between the King and you, and to deliver,    Like free and honest men, our just opinions    And comforts to your cause.  CAMPEIUS. Most honour'd madam,    My Lord of York, out of his noble nature,    Zeal and obedience he still bore your Grace,    Forgetting, like a good man, your late censure    Both of his truth and him-which was too far-    Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace,    His service and his counsel.  QUEEN KATHARINE.  [Aside]  To betray me.-    My lords, I thank you both for your good wins;    Ye speak like honest men-pray God ye prove so!    But how to make ye suddenly an answer,    In such a point of weight, so near mine honour,    More near my life, I fear, with my weak wit,    And to such men of gravity and learning,    In truth I know not. I was set at work    Among my maids, full little, God knows, looking    Either for such men or such business.    For her sake that I have been-for I feel    The last fit of my greatness-good your Graces,    Let me have time and counsel for my cause.    Alas, I am a woman, friendless, hopeless!  WOLSEY. Madam, you wrong the King's love with these fears;    Your hopes and friends are infinite.  QUEEN KATHARINE. In England    But little for my profit; can you think, lords,    That any Englishman dare give me counsel?    Or be a known friend, 'gainst his Highness' pleasure-    Though he be grown so desperate to be honest-    And live a subject? Nay, forsooth, my friends,    They that must weigh out my afflictions,    They that my trust must grow to, live not here;    They are, as all my other comforts, far hence,    In mine own country, lords.  CAMPEIUS. I would your Grace    Would leave your griefs, and take my counsel.  QUEEN KATHARINE. How, sir?  CAMPEIUS. Put your main cause into the King's protection;    He's loving and most gracious. 'Twill be much    Both for your honour better and your cause;    For if the trial of the law o'ertake ye    You'll part away disgrac'd.  WOLSEY. He tells you rightly.  QUEEN KATHARINE. Ye tell me what ye wish for both-my ruin.    Is this your Christian counsel? Out upon ye!    Heaven is above all yet: there sits a Judge    That no king can corrupt.  CAMPEIUS. Your rage mistakes us.  QUEEN KATHARINE. The more shame for ye; holy men I thought ye,    Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues;    But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye.    Mend 'em, for shame, my lords. Is this your comfort?    The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady-    A woman lost among ye, laugh'd at, scorn'd?    I will not wish ye half my miseries:    I have more charity; but say I warned ye.    Take heed, for heaven's sake take heed, lest at once    The burden of my sorrows fall upon ye.  WOLSEY. Madam, this is a mere distraction;    You turn the good we offer into envy.  QUEEN KATHARINE. Ye turn me into nothing. Woe upon ye,    And all such false professors! Would you have me-    If you have any justice, any pity,    If ye be any thing but churchmen's habits-    Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me?    Alas! has banish'd me his bed already,    His love too long ago! I am old, my lords,    And all the fellowship I hold now with him    Is only my obedience. What can happen    To me above this wretchedness? All your studies    Make me a curse like this.  CAMPEIUS. Your fears are worse.  QUEEN KATHARINE. Have I liv'd thus long-let me speak myself,    Since virtue finds no friends-a wife, a true one?    A woman, I dare say without vain-glory,    Never yet branded with suspicion?    Have I with all my full affections    Still met the King, lov'd him next heav'n, obey'd him,    Been, out of fondness, superstitious to him,    Almost forgot my prayers to content him,    And am I thus rewarded? 'Tis not well, lords.    Bring me a constant woman to her husband,    One that ne'er dream'd a joy beyond his pleasure,    And to that woman, when she has done most,    Yet will I add an honour-a great patience.  WOLSEY. Madam, you wander from the good we aim at.  QUEEN KATHARINE. My lord, I dare not make myself so guilty,    To give up willingly that noble title    Your master wed me to: nothing but death    Shall e'er divorce my dignities.  WOLSEY. Pray hear me.  QUEEN KATHARINE. Would I had never trod this English earth,    Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it!    Ye have angels' faces, but heaven knows your hearts.    What will become of me now, wretched lady?    I am the most unhappy woman living.    [To her WOMEN]  Alas, poor wenches, where are now      your fortunes?    Shipwreck'd upon a kingdom, where no pity,    No friends, no hope; no kindred weep for me;    Almost no grave allow'd me. Like the My,    That once was mistress of the field, and flourish'd,    I'll hang my head and perish.  WOLSEY. If your Grace    Could but be brought to know our ends are honest,    You'd feel more comfort. Why should we, good lady,    Upon what cause, wrong you? Alas, our places,    The way of our profession is against it;    We are to cure such sorrows, not to sow 'em.    For goodness' sake, consider what you do;    How you may hurt yourself, ay, utterly    Grow from the King's acquaintance, by this carriage.    The hearts of princes kiss obedience,    So much they love it; but to stubborn spirits    They swell and grow as terrible as storms.    I know you have a gentle, noble temper,    A soul as even as a calm. Pray think us    Those we profess, peace-makers, friends, and servants.  CAMPEIUS. Madam, you'll find it so. You wrong your virtues    With these weak women's fears. A noble spirit,    As yours was put into you, ever casts    Such doubts as false coin from it. The King loves you;    Beware you lose it not. For us, if you please    To trust us in your business, we are ready    To use our utmost studies in your service.  QUEEN KATHARINE. Do what ye will my lords; and pray      forgive me    If I have us'd myself unmannerly;    You know I am a woman, lacking wit    To make a seemly answer to such persons.    Pray do my service to his Majesty;    He has my heart yet, and shall have my prayers    While I shall have my life. Come, reverend fathers,    Bestow your counsels on me; she now begs    That little thought, when she set footing here,    She should have bought her dignities so dear.              ExeuntACT III.SCENE 2.London. The palaceEnter the DUKE OF NORFOLK, the DUKE OF SUFFOLK, the EARL OF SURREY,and the LORD CHAMBERLAIN  NORFOLK. If you will now unite in your complaints    And force them with a constancy, the Cardinal    Cannot stand under them: if you omit    The offer of this time, I cannot promise    But that you shall sustain moe new disgraces    With these you bear already.  SURREY. I am joyful    To meet the least occasion that may give me    Remembrance of my father-in-law, the Duke,    To be reveng'd on him.  SUFFOLK. Which of the peers    Have uncontemn'd gone by him, or at least    Strangely neglected? When did he regard    The stamp of nobleness in any person    Out of himself?  CHAMBERLAIN. My lords, you speak your pleasures.    What he deserves of you and me I know;    What we can do to him-though now the time    Gives way to us-I much fear. If you cannot    Bar his access to th' King, never attempt    Anything on him; for he hath a witchcraft    Over the King in's tongue.  NORFOLK. O, fear him not!    His spell in that is out; the King hath found    Matter against him that for ever mars    The honey of his language. No, he's settled,    Not to come off, in his displeasure.  SURREY. Sir,    I should be glad to hear such news as this    Once every hour.  NORFOLK. Believe it, this is true:    In the divorce his contrary proceedings    Are all unfolded; wherein he appears    As I would wish mine enemy.  SURREY. How came    His practices to light?  SUFFOLK. Most Strangely.  SURREY. O, how, how?  SUFFOLK. The Cardinal's letters to the Pope miscarried,    And came to th' eye o' th' King; wherein was read    How that the Cardinal did entreat his Holiness    To stay the judgment o' th' divorce; for if    It did take place, 'I do' quoth he 'perceive    My king is tangled in affection to    A creature of the Queen's, Lady Anne Bullen.'  SURREY. Has the King this?  SUFFOLK. Believe it.  SURREY. Will this work?  CHAMBERLAIN. The King in this perceives him how he coasts    And hedges his own way. But in this point    All his tricks founder, and he brings his physic    After his patient's death: the King already    Hath married the fair lady.  SURREY. Would he had!  SUFFOLK. May you be happy in your wish, my lord!    For, I profess, you have it.  SURREY. Now, all my joy    Trace the conjunction!  SUFFOLK. My amen to't!  NORFOLK. An men's!  SUFFOLK. There's order given for her coronation;    Marry, this is yet but young, and may be left    To some ears unrecounted. But, my lords,    She is a gallant creature, and complete    In mind and feature. I persuade me from her    Will fall some blessing to this land, which shall    In it be memoriz'd.  SURREY. But will the King    Digest this letter of the Cardinal's?    The Lord forbid!  NORFOLK. Marry, amen!  SUFFOLK. No, no;    There be moe wasps that buzz about his nose    Will make this sting the sooner. Cardinal Campeius    Is stol'n away to Rome; hath ta'en no leave;    Has left the cause o' th' King unhandled, and    Is posted, as the agent of our Cardinal,    To second all his plot. I do assure you    The King cried 'Ha!' at this.  CHAMBERLAIN. Now, God incense him,    And let him cry 'Ha!' louder!  NORFOLK. But, my lord,    When returns Cranmer?  SUFFOLK. He is return'd in his opinions; which    Have satisfied the King for his divorce,    Together with all famous colleges    Almost in Christendom. Shortly, I believe,    His second marriage shall be publish'd, and    Her coronation. Katharine no more    Shall be call'd queen, but princess dowager    And widow to Prince Arthur.  NORFOLK. This same Cranmer's    A worthy fellow, and hath ta'en much pain    In the King's business.  SUFFOLK. He has; and we shall see him    For it an archbishop.  NORFOLK. So I hear.  SUFFOLK. 'Tis so.        Enter WOLSEY and CROMWELL    The Cardinal!  NORFOLK. Observe, observe, he's moody.  WOLSEY. The packet, Cromwell,    Gave't you the King?  CROMWELL. To his own hand, in's bedchamber.  WOLSEY. Look'd he o' th' inside of the paper?  CROMWELL. Presently    He did unseal them; and the first he view'd,    He did it with a serious mind; a heed    Was in his countenance. You he bade    Attend him here this morning.  WOLSEY. Is he ready    To come abroad?  CROMWELL. I think by this he is.  WOLSEY. Leave me awhile.                              Exit CROMWELL    [Aside]  It shall be to the Duchess of Alencon,    The French King's sister; he shall marry her.    Anne Bullen! No, I'll no Anne Bullens for him;    There's more in't than fair visage. Bullen!    No, we'll no Bullens. Speedily I wish    To hear from Rome. The Marchioness of Pembroke!  NORFOLK. He's discontented.  SUFFOLK. May be he hears the King    Does whet his anger to him.  SURREY. Sharp enough,    Lord, for thy justice!  WOLSEY.  [Aside]  The late Queen's gentlewoman, a knight's      daughter,    To be her mistress' mistress! The Queen's queen!    This candle burns not clear. 'Tis I must snuff it;    Then out it goes. What though I know her virtuous    And well deserving? Yet I know her for    A spleeny Lutheran; and not wholesome to    Our cause that she should lie i' th' bosom of    Our hard-rul'd King. Again, there is sprung up    An heretic, an arch one, Cranmer; one    Hath crawl'd into the favour of the King,    And is his oracle.  NORFOLK. He is vex'd at something.        Enter the KING, reading of a schedule, and LOVELL  SURREY. I would 'twere something that would fret the string,    The master-cord on's heart!  SUFFOLK. The King, the King!  KING. What piles of wealth hath he accumulated    To his own portion! And what expense by th' hour    Seems to flow from him! How, i' th' name of thrift,    Does he rake this together?-Now, my lords,    Saw you the Cardinal?  NORFOLK. My lord, we have    Stood here observing him. Some strange commotion    Is in his brain: he bites his lip and starts,    Stops on a sudden, looks upon the ground,    Then lays his finger on his temple; straight    Springs out into fast gait; then stops again,    Strikes his breast hard; and anon he casts    His eye against the moon. In most strange postures    We have seen him set himself.  KING. It may well be    There is a mutiny in's mind. This morning    Papers of state he sent me to peruse,    As I requir'd; and wot you what I found    There-on my conscience, put unwittingly?    Forsooth, an inventory, thus importing    The several parcels of his plate, his treasure,    Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which    I find at such proud rate that it outspeaks    Possession of a subject.  NORFOLK. It's heaven's will;    Some spirit put this paper in the packet    To bless your eye withal.  KING. If we did think    His contemplation were above the earth    And fix'd on spiritual object, he should still    dwell in his musings; but I am afraid    His thinkings are below the moon, not worth    His serious considering.                        [The KING takes his seat and whispers LOVELL,                                           who goes to the CARDINAL]  WOLSEY. Heaven forgive me!    Ever God bless your Highness!  KING. Good, my lord,    You are full of heavenly stuff, and bear the inventory    Of your best graces in your mind; the which    You were now running o'er. You have scarce time    To steal from spiritual leisure a brief span    To keep your earthly audit; sure, in that    I deem you an ill husband, and am glad    To have you therein my companion.  WOLSEY. Sir,    For holy offices I have a time; a time    To think upon the part of business which    I bear i' th' state; and nature does require    Her times of preservation, which perforce    I, her frail son, amongst my brethren mortal,    Must give my tendance to.  KING. You have said well.  WOLSEY. And ever may your Highness yoke together,    As I will lend you cause, my doing well    With my well saying!  KING. 'Tis well said again;    And 'tis a kind of good deed to say well;    And yet words are no deeds. My father lov'd you:    He said he did; and with his deed did crown    His word upon you. Since I had my office    I have kept you next my heart; have not alone    Employ'd you where high profits might come home,    But par'd my present havings to bestow    My bounties upon you.  WOLSEY.  [Aside]  What should this mean?  SURREY.  [Aside]  The Lord increase this business!  KING. Have I not made you    The prime man of the state? I pray you tell me    If what I now pronounce you have found true;    And, if you may confess it, say withal    If you are bound to us or no. What say you?  WOLSEY. My sovereign, I confess your royal graces,    Show'r'd on me daily, have been more than could    My studied purposes requite; which went    Beyond all man's endeavours. My endeavours,    Have ever come too short of my desires,    Yet fil'd with my abilities; mine own ends    Have been mine so that evermore they pointed    To th' good of your most sacred person and    The profit of the state. For your great graces    Heap'd upon me, poor undeserver, I    Can nothing render but allegiant thanks;    My pray'rs to heaven for you; my loyalty,    Which ever has and ever shall be growing,    Till death, that winter, kill it.  KING. Fairly answer'd!    A loyal and obedient subject is    Therein illustrated; the honour of it    Does pay the act of it, as, i' th' contrary,    The foulness is the punishment. I presume    That, as my hand has open'd bounty to you,    My heart dropp'd love, my pow'r rain'd honour, more    On you than any, so your hand and heart,    Your brain, and every function of your power,    Should, notwithstanding that your bond of duty,    As 'twere in love's particular, be more    To me, your friend, than any.  WOLSEY. I do profess    That for your Highness' good I ever labour'd    More than mine own; that am, have, and will be-    Though all the world should crack their duty to you,    And throw it from their soul; though perils did    Abound as thick as thought could make 'em, and    Appear in forms more horrid-yet my duty,    As doth a rock against the chiding flood,    Should the approach of this wild river break,    And stand unshaken yours.  KING. 'Tis nobly spoken.    Take notice, lords, he has a loyal breast,    For you have seen him open 't. Read o'er this;                                                  [Giving him papers]    And after, this; and then to breakfast with    What appetite you have.                Exit the KING, frowning upon the CARDINAL; the NOBLES                             throng after him, smiling and whispering  WOLSEY. What should this mean?    What sudden anger's this? How have I reap'd it?    He parted frowning from me, as if ruin    Leap'd from his eyes; so looks the chafed lion    Upon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him-    Then makes him nothing. I must read this paper;    I fear, the story of his anger. 'Tis so;    This paper has undone me. 'Tis th' account    Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together    For mine own ends; indeed to gain the popedom,    And fee my friends in Rome. O negligence,    Fit for a fool to fall by! What cross devil    Made me put this main secret in the packet    I sent the King? Is there no way to cure this?    No new device to beat this from his brains?    I know 'twill stir him strongly; yet I know    A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune,    Will bring me off again. What's this? 'To th' Pope.'    The letter, as I live, with all the business    I writ to's Holiness. Nay then, farewell!    I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness,    And from that full meridian of my glory    I haste now to my setting. I shall fall    Like a bright exhalation in the evening,    And no man see me more.        Re-enter to WOLSEY the DUKES OF NORFOLK and        SUFFOLK, the EARL OF SURREY, and the LORD        CHAMBERLAIN  NORFOLK. Hear the King's pleasure, Cardinal, who commands you    To render up the great seal presently    Into our hands, and to confine yourself    To Asher House, my Lord of Winchester's,    Till you hear further from his Highness.  WOLSEY. Stay:    Where's your commission, lords? Words cannot carry    Authority so weighty.  SUFFOLK. Who dares cross 'em,    Bearing the King's will from his mouth expressly?  WOLSEY. Till I find more than will or words to do it-    I mean your malice-know, officious lords,    I dare and must deny it. Now I feel    Of what coarse metal ye are moulded-envy;    How eagerly ye follow my disgraces,    As if it fed ye; and how sleek and wanton    Ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin!    Follow your envious courses, men of malice;    You have Christian warrant for 'em, and no doubt    In time will find their fit rewards. That seal    You ask with such a violence, the King-    Mine and your master-with his own hand gave me;    Bade me enjoy it, with the place and honours,    During my life; and, to confirm his goodness,    Tied it by letters-patents. Now, who'll take it?  SURREY. The King, that gave it.  WOLSEY. It must be himself then.  SURREY. Thou art a proud traitor, priest.  WOLSEY. Proud lord, thou liest.    Within these forty hours Surrey durst better    Have burnt that tongue than said so.  SURREY. Thy ambition,    Thou scarlet sin, robb'd this bewailing land    Of noble Buckingham, my father-in-law.    The heads of all thy brother cardinals,    With thee and all thy best parts bound together,    Weigh'd not a hair of his. Plague of your policy!    You sent me deputy for Ireland;    Far from his succour, from the King, from all    That might have mercy on the fault thou gav'st him;    Whilst your great goodness, out of holy pity,    Absolv'd him with an axe.  WOLSEY. This, and all else    This talking lord can lay upon my credit,    I answer is most false. The Duke by law    Found his deserts; how innocent I was    From any private malice in his end,    His noble jury and foul cause can witness.    If I lov'd many words, lord, I should tell you    You have as little honesty as honour,    That in the way of loyalty and truth    Toward the King, my ever royal master,    Dare mate a sounder man than Surrey can be    And an that love his follies.  SURREY. By my soul,    Your long coat, priest, protects you; thou shouldst feel    My sword i' the life-blood of thee else. My lords    Can ye endure to hear this arrogance?    And from this fellow? If we live thus tamely,    To be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet,    Farewell nobility! Let his Grace go forward    And dare us with his cap like larks.  WOLSEY. All goodness    Is poison to thy stomach.  SURREY. Yes, that goodness    Of gleaning all the land's wealth into one,    Into your own hands, Cardinal, by extortion;    The goodness of your intercepted packets    You writ to th' Pope against the King; your goodness,    Since you provoke me, shall be most notorious.    My Lord of Norfolk, as you are truly noble,    As you respect the common good, the state    Of our despis'd nobility, our issues,    Whom, if he live, will scarce be gentlemen-    Produce the grand sum of his sins, the articles    Collected from his life. I'll startle you    Worse than the sacring bell, when the brown wench    Lay kissing in your arms, Lord Cardinal.  WOLSEY. How much, methinks, I could despise this man,    But that I am bound in charity against it!  NORFOLK. Those articles, my lord, are in the King's hand;    But, thus much, they are foul ones.  WOLSEY. So much fairer    And spotless shall mine innocence arise,    When the King knows my truth.  SURREY. This cannot save you.    I thank my memory I yet remember    Some of these articles; and out they shall.    Now, if you can blush and cry guilty, Cardinal,    You'll show a little honesty.  WOLSEY. Speak on, sir;    I dare your worst objections. If I blush,    It is to see a nobleman want manners.  SURREY. I had rather want those than my head. Have at you!    First, that without the King's assent or knowledge    You wrought to be a legate; by which power    You maim'd the jurisdiction of all bishops.  NORFOLK. Then, that in all you writ to Rome, or else    To foreign princes, 'Ego et Rex meus'    Was still inscrib'd; in which you brought the King    To be your servant.  SUFFOLK. Then, that without the knowledge    Either of King or Council, when you went    Ambassador to the Emperor, you made bold    To carry into Flanders the great seal.  SURREY. Item, you sent a large commission    To Gregory de Cassado, to conclude,    Without the King's will or the state's allowance,    A league between his Highness and Ferrara.  SUFFOLK. That out of mere ambition you have caus'd    Your holy hat to be stamp'd on the King's coin.  SURREY. Then, that you have sent innumerable substance,    By what means got I leave to your own conscience,    To furnish Rome and to prepare the ways    You have for dignities, to the mere undoing    Of all the kingdom. Many more there are,    Which, since they are of you, and odious,    I will not taint my mouth with.  CHAMBERLAIN. O my lord,    Press not a falling man too far! 'Tis virtue.    His faults lie open to the laws; let them,    Not you, correct him. My heart weeps to see him    So little of his great self.  SURREY. I forgive him.  SUFFOLK. Lord Cardinal, the King's further pleasure is-    Because all those things you have done of late,    By your power legatine within this kingdom,    Fall into th' compass of a praemunire-    That therefore such a writ be sued against you:    To forfeit all your goods, lands, tenements,    Chattels, and whatsoever, and to be    Out of the King's protection. This is my charge.  NORFOLK. And so we'll leave you to your meditations    How to live better. For your stubborn answer    About the giving back the great seal to us,    The King shall know it, and, no doubt, shall thank you.    So fare you well, my little good Lord Cardinal.                                                Exeunt all but WOLSEY  WOLSEY. So farewell to the little good you bear me.    Farewell, a long farewell, to all my greatness!    This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth    The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms    And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;    The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,    And when he thinks, good easy man, full surely    His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,    And then he falls, as I do. I have ventur'd,    Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,    This many summers in a sea of glory;    But far beyond my depth. My high-blown pride    At length broke under me, and now has left me,    Weary and old with service, to the mercy    Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me.    Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye;    I feel my heart new open'd. O, how wretched    Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours!    There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to,    That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin    More pangs and fears than wars or women have;    And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,    Never to hope again.         Enter CROMWELL, standing amazed    Why, how now, Cromwell!  CROMWELL. I have no power to speak, sir.  WOLSEY. What, amaz'd    At my misfortunes? Can thy spirit wonder    A great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,    I am fall'n indeed.  CROMWELL. How does your Grace?  WOLSEY. Why, well;    Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell.    I know myself now, and I feel within me    A peace above all earthly dignities,    A still and quiet conscience. The King has cur'd me,    I humbly thank his Grace; and from these shoulders,    These ruin'd pillars, out of pity, taken    A load would sink a navy-too much honour.    O, 'tis a burden, Cromwell, 'tis a burden    Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven!  CROMWELL. I am glad your Grace has made that right use of it.  WOLSEY. I hope I have. I am able now, methinks,    Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,    To endure more miseries and greater far    Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.    What news abroad?  CROMWELL. The heaviest and the worst    Is your displeasure with the King.  WOLSEY. God bless him!  CROMWELL. The next is that Sir Thomas More is chosen    Lord Chancellor in your place.  WOLSEY. That's somewhat sudden.    But he's a learned man. May he continue    Long in his Highness' favour, and do justice    For truth's sake and his conscience; that his bones    When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings,    May have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on him!    What more?  CROMWELL. That Cranmer is return'd with welcome,    Install'd Lord Archbishop of Canterbury.  WOLSEY. That's news indeed.  CROMWELL. Last, that the Lady Anne,    Whom the King hath in secrecy long married,    This day was view'd in open as his queen,    Going to chapel; and the voice is now    Only about her coronation.  WOLSEY. There was the weight that pull'd me down.      O Cromwell,    The King has gone beyond me. All my glories    In that one woman I have lost for ever.    No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours,    Or gild again the noble troops that waited    Upon my smiles. Go get thee from me, Cromwell;    I am a poor fall'n man, unworthy now    To be thy lord and master. Seek the King;    That sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him    What and how true thou art. He will advance thee;    Some little memory of me will stir him-    I know his noble nature-not to let    Thy hopeful service perish too. Good Cromwell,    Neglect him not; make use now, and provide    For thine own future safety.  CROMWELL. O my lord,    Must I then leave you? Must I needs forgo    So good, so noble, and so true a master?    Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron,    With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord.    The King shall have my service; but my prayers    For ever and for ever shall be yours.  WOLSEY. Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear    In all my miseries; but thou hast forc'd me,    Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman.    Let's dry our eyes; and thus far hear me, Cromwell,    And when I am forgotten, as I shall be,    And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention    Of me more must be heard of, say I taught thee-    Say Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,    And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,    Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in-    A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it.    Mark but my fall and that that ruin'd me.    Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:    By that sin fell the angels. How can man then,    The image of his Maker, hope to win by it?    Love thyself last; cherish those hearts that hate thee;    Corruption wins not more than honesty.    Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace    To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not;    Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,    Thy God's, and truth's; then, if thou fall'st, O Cromwell,    Thou fall'st a blessed martyr!    Serve the King, and-prithee lead me in.    There take an inventory of all I have    To the last penny; 'tis the King's. My robe,    And my integrity to heaven, is all    I dare now call mine own. O Cromwell, Cromwell!    Had I but serv'd my God with half the zeal    I serv'd my King, he would not in mine age    Have left me naked to mine enemies.  CROMWELL. Good sir, have patience.  WOLSEY. So I have. Farewell    The hopes of court! My hopes in heaven do dwell.           ExeuntACT IV. SCENE 1.A street in WestminsterEnter two GENTLEMEN, meeting one another  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Y'are well met once again.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. So are you.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. You come to take your stand here, and      behold    The Lady Anne pass from her coronation?  SECOND GENTLEMAN. 'Tis all my business. At our last encounter    The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. 'Tis very true. But that time offer'd      sorrow;    This, general joy.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. 'Tis well. The citizens,    I am sure, have shown at full their royal minds-    As, let 'em have their rights, they are ever forward-    In celebration of this day with shows,    Pageants, and sights of honour.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Never greater,    Nor, I'll assure you, better taken, sir.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. May I be bold to ask what that contains,    That paper in your hand?  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Yes; 'tis the list    Of those that claim their offices this day,    By custom of the coronation.    The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claims    To be High Steward; next, the Duke of Norfolk,    He to be Earl Marshal. You may read the rest.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. I thank you, sir; had I not known      those customs,    I should have been beholding to your paper.    But, I beseech you, what's become of Katharine,    The Princess Dowager? How goes her business?  FIRST GENTLEMAN. That I can tell you too. The Archbishop    Of Canterbury, accompanied with other    Learned and reverend fathers of his order,    Held a late court at Dunstable, six miles of    From Ampthill, where the Princess lay; to which    She was often cited by them, but appear'd not.    And, to be short, for not appearance and    The King's late scruple, by the main assent    Of all these learned men, she was divorc'd,    And the late marriage made of none effect;    Since which she was removed to Kimbolton,    Where she remains now sick.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Alas, good lady!                       [Trumpets]    The trumpets sound. Stand close, the Queen is coming.[Hautboys]              THE ORDER OF THE CORONATION.    1. A lively flourish of trumpets.    2. Then two JUDGES.    3. LORD CHANCELLOR, with purse and mace before him.    4. CHORISTERS singing.                                    [Music]    5. MAYOR OF LONDON, bearing the mace. Then GARTER, in       his coat of arms, and on his head he wore a gilt copper       crown.    6. MARQUIS DORSET, bearing a sceptre of gold, on his head a       demi-coronal of gold. With him, the EARL OF SURREY,       bearing the rod of silver with the dove, crowned with an       earl's coronet. Collars of Esses.    7. DUKE OF SUFFOLK, in his robe of estate, his coronet on       his head, bearing a long white wand, as High Steward.       With him, the DUKE OF NORFOLK, with the rod of       marshalship, a coronet on his head. Collars of Esses.    8. A canopy borne by four of the CINQUE-PORTS; under it       the QUEEN in her robe; in her hair richly adorned with       pearl, crowned. On each side her, the BISHOPS OF LONDON       and WINCHESTER.    9. The old DUCHESS OF NORFOLK, in a coronal of gold       wrought with flowers, bearing the QUEEN'S train.   10. Certain LADIES or COUNTESSES, with plain circlets of gold       without flowers.             Exeunt, first passing over the stage in order and state,                                and then a great flourish of trumpets  SECOND GENTLEMAN. A royal train, believe me. These know.    Who's that that bears the sceptre?  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Marquis Dorset;    And that the Earl of Surrey, with the rod.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. A bold brave gentleman. That should be    The Duke of Suffolk?  FIRST GENTLEMAN. 'Tis the same-High Steward.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. And that my Lord of Norfolk?  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Yes.  SECOND GENTLEMAN.  [Looking on the QUEEN]  Heaven      bless thee!    Thou hast the sweetest face I ever look'd on.    Sir, as I have a soul, she is an angel;    Our king has all the Indies in his arms,    And more and richer, when he strains that lady;    I cannot blame his conscience.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. They that bear    The cloth of honour over her are four barons    Of the Cinque-ports.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Those men are happy; and so are all      are near her.    I take it she that carries up the train    Is that old noble lady, Duchess of Norfolk.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. It is; and all the rest are countesses.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Their coronets say so. These are stars indeed,    And sometimes falling ones.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. No more of that.                   Exit Procession, with a great flourish of trumpets               Enter a third GENTLEMAN    God save you, sir! Where have you been broiling?  THIRD GENTLEMAN. Among the crowds i' th' Abbey, where a finger    Could not be wedg'd in more; I am stifled    With the mere rankness of their joy.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. You saw    The ceremony?  THIRD GENTLEMAN. That I did.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. How was it?  THIRD GENTLEMAN. Well worth the seeing.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Good sir, speak it to us.  THIRD GENTLEMAN. As well as I am able. The rich stream    Of lords and ladies, having brought the Queen    To a prepar'd place in the choir, fell of    A distance from her, while her Grace sat down    To rest awhile, some half an hour or so,    In a rich chair of state, opposing freely    The beauty of her person to the people.    Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest woman    That ever lay by man; which when the people    Had the full view of, such a noise arose    As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest,    As loud, and to as many tunes; hats, cloaks-    Doublets, I think-flew up, and had their faces    Been loose, this day they had been lost. Such joy    I never saw before. Great-bellied women,    That had not half a week to go, like rams    In the old time of war, would shake the press,    And make 'em reel before 'em. No man living    Could say 'This is my wife' there, all were woven    So strangely in one piece.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. But what follow'd?  THIRD GENTLEMAN. At length her Grace rose, and with      modest paces    Came to the altar, where she kneel'd, and saintlike    Cast her fair eyes to heaven, and pray'd devoutly.    Then rose again, and bow'd her to the people;    When by the Archbishop of Canterbury    She had all the royal makings of a queen:    As holy oil, Edward Confessor's crown,    The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems    Laid nobly on her; which perform'd, the choir,    With all the choicest music of the kingdom,    Together sung 'Te Deum.' So she parted,    And with the same full state pac'd back again    To York Place, where the feast is held.  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Sir,    You must no more call it York Place: that's past:    For since the Cardinal fell that title's lost.    'Tis now the King's, and called Whitehall.  THIRD GENTLEMAN. I know it;    But 'tis so lately alter'd that the old name    Is fresh about me.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. What two reverend bishops    Were those that went on each side of the Queen?  THIRD GENTLEMAN. Stokesly and Gardiner: the one of Winchester,    Newly preferr'd from the King's secretary;    The other, London.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. He of Winchester    Is held no great good lover of the Archbishop's,    The virtuous Cranmer.  THIRD GENTLEMAN. All the land knows that;    However, yet there is no great breach. When it comes,    Cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Who may that be, I pray you?  THIRD GENTLEMAN. Thomas Cromwell,    A man in much esteem with th' King, and truly    A worthy friend. The King has made him Master    O' th' jewel House,    And one, already, of the Privy Council.  SECOND GENTLEMAN. He will deserve more.  THIRD GENTLEMAN. Yes, without all doubt.    Come, gentlemen, ye shall go my way, which    Is to th' court, and there ye shall be my guests:    Something I can command. As I walk thither,    I'll tell ye more.  BOTH. You may command us, sir.                               ExeuntACT IV. SCENE 2.KimboltonEnter KATHARINE, Dowager, sick; led between GRIFFITH, her Gentleman Usher,and PATIENCE, her woman  GRIFFITH. How does your Grace?  KATHARINE. O Griffith, sick to death!    My legs like loaden branches bow to th' earth,    Willing to leave their burden. Reach a chair.    So-now, methinks, I feel a little ease.    Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou led'st me,    That the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey,    Was dead?  GRIFFITH. Yes, madam; but I think your Grace,    Out of the pain you suffer'd, gave no ear to't.  KATHARINE. Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died.    If well, he stepp'd before me, happily,    For my example.  GRIFFITH. Well, the voice goes, madam;    For after the stout Earl Northumberland    Arrested him at York and brought him forward,    As a man sorely tainted, to his answer,    He fell sick suddenly, and grew so ill    He could not sit his mule.  KATHARINE. Alas, poor man!  GRIFFITH. At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,    Lodg'd in the abbey; where the reverend abbot,    With all his covent, honourably receiv'd him;    To whom he gave these words: 'O father Abbot,    An old man, broken with the storms of state,    Is come to lay his weary bones among ye;    Give him a little earth for charity!'    So went to bed; where eagerly his sickness    Pursu'd him still And three nights after this,    About the hour of eight-which he himself    Foretold should be his last-full of repentance,    Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows,    He gave his honours to the world again,    His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.  KATHARINE. So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him!    Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,    And yet with charity. He was a man    Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking    Himself with princes; one that, by suggestion,    Tied all the kingdom. Simony was fair play;    His own opinion was his law. I' th' presence    He would say untruths, and be ever double    Both in his words and meaning. He was never,    But where he meant to ruin, pitiful.    His promises were, as he then was, mighty;    But his performance, as he is now, nothing.    Of his own body he was ill, and gave    The clergy ill example.  GRIFFITH. Noble madam,    Men's evil manners live in brass: their virtues    We write in water. May it please your Highness    To hear me speak his good now?  KATHARINE. Yes, good Griffith;    I were malicious else.  GRIFFITH. This Cardinal,    Though from an humble stock, undoubtedly    Was fashion'd to much honour from his cradle.    He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one;    Exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading;    Lofty and sour to them that lov'd him not,    But to those men that sought him sweet as summer.    And though he were unsatisfied in getting-    Which was a sin-yet in bestowing, madam,    He was most princely: ever witness for him    Those twins of learning that he rais'd in you,    Ipswich and Oxford! One of which fell with him,    Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;    The other, though unfinish'd, yet so famous,    So excellent in art, and still so rising,    That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.    His overthrow heap'd happiness upon him;    For then, and not till then, he felt himself,    And found the blessedness of being little.    And, to add greater honours to his age    Than man could give him, he died fearing God.  KATHARINE. After my death I wish no other herald,    No other speaker of my living actions,    To keep mine honour from corruption,    But such an honest chronicler as Griffith.    Whom I most hated living, thou hast made me,    With thy religious truth and modesty,    Now in his ashes honour. Peace be with him!    patience, be near me still, and set me lower:    I have not long to trouble thee. Good Griffith,    Cause the musicians play me that sad note    I nam'd my knell, whilst I sit meditating    On that celestial harmony I go to.                                              [Sad and solemn music]  GRIFFITH. She is asleep. Good wench, let's sit down quiet,    For fear we wake her. Softly, gentle Patience.                 THE VISION.      Enter, solemnly tripping one after another, six      PERSONAGES clad in white robes, wearing on their      heads garlands of bays, and golden vizards on their      faces; branches of bays or palm in their hands. They      first congee unto her, then dance; and, at certain      changes, the first two hold a spare garland over her      head, at which the other four make reverent curtsies.      Then the two that held the garland deliver the      same to the other next two, who observe the same      order in their changes, and holding the garland over      her head; which done, they deliver the same garland      to the last two, who likewise observe the same order;      at which, as it were by inspiration, she makes      in her sleep signs of rejoicing, and holdeth up her      hands to heaven. And so in their dancing vanish,      carrying the garland with them. The music continues  KATHARINE. Spirits of peace, where are ye? Are ye all gone?    And leave me here in wretchedness behind ye?  GRIFFITH. Madam, we are here.  KATHARINE. It is not you I call for.    Saw ye none enter since I slept?  GRIFFITH. None, madam.  KATHARINE. No? Saw you not, even now, a blessed troop    Invite me to a banquet; whose bright faces    Cast thousand beams upon me, like the sun?    They promis'd me eternal happiness,    And brought me garlands, Griffith, which I feel    I am not worthy yet to wear. I shall, assuredly.  GRIFFITH. I am most joyful, madam, such good dreams    Possess your fancy.  KATHARINE. Bid the music leave,    They are harsh and heavy to me.                    [Music ceases]  PATIENCE. Do you note    How much her Grace is alter'd on the sudden?    How long her face is drawn! How pale she looks,    And of an earthly cold! Mark her eyes.  GRIFFITH. She is going, wench. Pray, pray.  PATIENCE. Heaven comfort her!             Enter a MESSENGER  MESSENGER. An't like your Grace-  KATHARINE. You are a saucy fellow.    Deserve we no more reverence?  GRIFFITH. You are to blame,    Knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness,    To use so rude behaviour. Go to, kneel.  MESSENGER. I humbly do entreat your Highness' pardon;    My haste made me unmannerly. There is staying    A gentleman, sent from the King, to see you.  KATHARINE. Admit him entrance, Griffith; but this fellow    Let me ne'er see again.                            Exit MESSENGER              Enter LORD CAPUCIUS    If my sight fail not,    You should be Lord Ambassador from the Emperor,    My royal nephew, and your name Capucius.  CAPUCIUS. Madam, the same-your servant.  KATHARINE. O, my Lord,    The times and titles now are alter'd strangely    With me since first you knew me. But, I pray you,    What is your pleasure with me?  CAPUCIUS. Noble lady,    First, mine own service to your Grace; the next,    The King's request that I would visit you,    Who grieves much for your weakness, and by me    Sends you his princely commendations    And heartily entreats you take good comfort.  KATHARINE. O my good lord, that comfort comes too late,    'Tis like a pardon after execution:    That gentle physic, given in time, had cur'd me;    But now I am past all comforts here, but prayers.    How does his Highness?  CAPUCIUS. Madam, in good health.  KATHARINE. So may he ever do! and ever flourish    When I shall dwell with worms, and my poor name    Banish'd the kingdom! Patience, is that letter    I caus'd you write yet sent away?  PATIENCE. No, madam.                       [Giving it to KATHARINE]  KATHARINE. Sir, I most humbly pray you to deliver    This to my lord the King.  CAPUCIUS. Most willing, madam.  KATHARINE. In which I have commended to his goodness    The model of our chaste loves, his young daughter-    The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her!-    Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding-    She is young, and of a noble modest nature;    I hope she will deserve well-and a little    To love her for her mother's sake, that lov'd him,    Heaven knows how dearly. My next poor petition    Is that his noble Grace would have some pity    Upon my wretched women that so long    Have follow'd both my fortunes faithfully;    Of which there is not one, I dare avow-    And now I should not lie-but will deserve,    For virtue and true beauty of the soul,    For honesty and decent carriage,    A right good husband, let him be a noble;    And sure those men are happy that shall have 'em.    The last is for my men-they are the poorest,    But poverty could never draw 'em from me-    That they may have their wages duly paid 'em,    And something over to remember me by.    If heaven had pleas'd to have given me longer life    And able means, we had not parted thus.    These are the whole contents; and, good my lord,    By that you love the dearest in this world,    As you wish Christian peace to souls departed,    Stand these poor people's friend, and urge the King    To do me this last right.  CAPUCIUS. By heaven, I will,    Or let me lose the fashion of a man!  KATHARINE. I thank you, honest lord. Remember me    In all humility unto his Highness;    Say his long trouble now is passing    Out of this world. Tell him in death I bless'd him,    For so I will. Mine eyes grow dim. Farewell,    My lord. Griffith, farewell. Nay, Patience,    You must not leave me yet. I must to bed;    Call in more women. When I am dead, good wench,    Let me be us'd with honour; strew me over    With maiden flowers, that all the world may know    I was a chaste wife to my grave. Embalm me,    Then lay me forth; although unqueen'd, yet like    A queen, and daughter to a king, inter me.    I can no more.                          Exeunt, leading KATHARINEACT V. SCENE 1.London. A gallery in the palaceEnter GARDINER, BISHOP OF WINCHESTER, a PAGE with a torch before him,met by SIR THOMAS LOVELL  GARDINER. It's one o'clock, boy, is't not?  BOY. It hath struck.  GARDINER. These should be hours for necessities,    Not for delights; times to repair our nature    With comforting repose, and not for us    To waste these times. Good hour of night, Sir Thomas!    Whither so late?  LOVELL. Came you from the King, my lord?  GARDINER. I did, Sir Thomas, and left him at primero    With the Duke of Suffolk.  LOVELL. I must to him too,    Before he go to bed. I'll take my leave.  GARDINER. Not yet, Sir Thomas Lovell. What's the matter?    It seems you are in haste. An if there be    No great offence belongs to't, give your friend    Some touch of your late business. Affairs that walk-    As they say spirits do-at midnight, have    In them a wilder nature than the business    That seeks despatch by day.  LOVELL. My lord, I love you;    And durst commend a secret to your ear    Much weightier than this work. The Queen's in labour,    They say in great extremity, and fear'd    She'll with the labour end.  GARDINER. The fruit she goes with    I pray for heartily, that it may find    Good time, and live; but for the stock, Sir Thomas,    I wish it grubb'd up now.  LOVELL. Methinks I could    Cry thee amen; and yet my conscience says    She's a good creature, and, sweet lady, does    Deserve our better wishes.  GARDINER. But, sir, sir-    Hear me, Sir Thomas. Y'are a gentleman    Of mine own way; I know you wise, religious;    And, let me tell you, it will ne'er be well-    'Twill not, Sir Thomas Lovell, take't of me-    Till Cranmer, Cromwell, her two hands, and she,    Sleep in their graves.  LOVELL. Now, sir, you speak of two    The most remark'd i' th' kingdom. As for Cromwell,    Beside that of the Jewel House, is made Master    O' th' Rolls, and the King's secretary; further, sir,    Stands in the gap and trade of moe preferments,    With which the time will load him. Th' Archbishop    Is the King's hand and tongue, and who dare speak    One syllable against him?  GARDINER. Yes, yes, Sir Thomas,    There are that dare; and I myself have ventur'd    To speak my mind of him; and indeed this day,    Sir-I may tell it you-I think I have    Incens'd the lords o' th' Council, that he is-    For so I know he is, they know he is-    A most arch heretic, a pestilence    That does infect the land; with which they moved    Have broken with the King, who hath so far    Given ear to our complaint-of his great grace    And princely care, foreseeing those fell mischiefs    Our reasons laid before him-hath commanded    To-morrow morning to the Council board    He be convented. He's a rank weed, Sir Thomas,    And we must root him out. From your affairs    I hinder you too long-good night, Sir Thomas.  LOVELL. Many good nights, my lord; I rest your servant.                                             Exeunt GARDINER and PAGE         Enter the KING and the DUKE OF SUFFOLK  KING. Charles, I will play no more to-night;    My mind's not on't; you are too hard for me.  SUFFOLK. Sir, I did never win of you before.  KING. But little, Charles;    Nor shall not, when my fancy's on my play.    Now, Lovell, from the Queen what is the news?  LOVELL. I could not personally deliver to her    What you commanded me, but by her woman    I sent your message; who return'd her thanks    In the great'st humbleness, and desir'd your Highness    Most heartily to pray for her.  KING. What say'st thou, ha?    To pray for her? What, is she crying out?  LOVELL. So said her woman; and that her suff'rance made    Almost each pang a death.  KING. Alas, good lady!  SUFFOLK. God safely quit her of her burden, and    With gentle travail, to the gladding of    Your Highness with an heir!  KING. 'Tis midnight, Charles;    Prithee to bed; and in thy pray'rs remember    Th' estate of my poor queen. Leave me alone,    For I must think of that which company    Will not be friendly to.  SUFFOLK. I wish your Highness    A quiet night, and my good mistress will    Remember in my prayers.  KING. Charles, good night.                             Exit SUFFOLK         Enter SIR ANTHONY DENNY    Well, sir, what follows?  DENNY. Sir, I have brought my lord the Archbishop,    As you commanded me.  KING. Ha! Canterbury?  DENNY. Ay, my good lord.  KING. 'Tis true. Where is he, Denny?  DENNY. He attends your Highness' pleasure.  KING. Bring him to us.                                   Exit DENNY  LOVELL.  [Aside]  This is about that which the bishop spake.    I am happily come hither.         Re-enter DENNY, With CRANMER  KING. Avoid the gallery.                     [LOVELL seems to stay]    Ha! I have said. Be gone.    What!                                     Exeunt LOVELL and DENNY  CRANMER.  [Aside]  I am fearful-wherefore frowns he thus?    'Tis his aspect of terror. All's not well.  KING. How now, my lord? You do desire to know    Wherefore I sent for you.  CRANMER.  [Kneeling]  It is my duty    T'attend your Highness' pleasure.  KING. Pray you, arise,    My good and gracious Lord of Canterbury.    Come, you and I must walk a turn together;    I have news to tell you; come, come, me your hand.    Ah, my good lord, I grieve at what I speak,    And am right sorry to repeat what follows.    I have, and most unwillingly, of late    Heard many grievous-I do say, my lord,    Grievous-complaints of you; which, being consider'd,    Have mov'd us and our Council that you shall    This morning come before us; where I know    You cannot with such freedom purge yourself    But that, till further trial in those charges    Which will require your answer, you must take    Your patience to you and be well contented    To make your house our Tow'r. You a brother of us,    It fits we thus proceed, or else no witness    Would come against you.  CRANMER. I humbly thank your Highness    And am right glad to catch this good occasion    Most throughly to be winnowed where my chaff    And corn shall fly asunder; for I know    There's none stands under more calumnious tongues    Than I myself, poor man.  KING. Stand up, good Canterbury;    Thy truth and thy integrity is rooted    In us, thy friend. Give me thy hand, stand up;    Prithee let's walk. Now, by my holidame,    What manner of man are you? My lord, I look'd    You would have given me your petition that    I should have ta'en some pains to bring together    Yourself and your accusers, and to have heard you    Without indurance further.  CRANMER. Most dread liege,    The good I stand on is my truth and honesty;    If they shall fail, I with mine enemies    Will triumph o'er my person; which I weigh not,    Being of those virtues vacant. I fear nothing    What can be said against me.  KING. Know you not    How your state stands i' th' world, with the whole world?    Your enemies are many, and not small; their practices    Must bear the same proportion; and not ever    The justice and the truth o' th' question carries    The due o' th' verdict with it; at what ease    Might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt    To swear against you? Such things have been done.    You are potently oppos'd, and with a malice    Of as great size. Ween you of better luck,    I mean in perjur'd witness, than your Master,    Whose minister you are, whiles here He liv'd    Upon this naughty earth? Go to, go to;    You take a precipice for no leap of danger,    And woo your own destruction.  CRANMER. God and your Majesty    Protect mine innocence, or I fall into    The trap is laid for me!  KING. Be of good cheer;    They shall no more prevail than we give way to.    Keep comfort to you, and this morning see    You do appear before them; if they shall chance,    In charging you with matters, to commit you,    The best persuasions to the contrary    Fail not to use, and with what vehemency    Th' occasion shall instruct you. If entreaties    Will render you no remedy, this ring    Deliver them, and your appeal to us    There make before them. Look, the good man weeps!    He's honest, on mine honour. God's blest Mother!    I swear he is true-hearted, and a soul    None better in my kingdom. Get you gone,    And do as I have bid you.                                                         Exit CRANMER    He has strangled his language in his tears.           Enter OLD LADY  GENTLEMAN.  [Within]  Come back; what mean you?  OLD LADY. I'll not come back; the tidings that I bring    Will make my boldness manners. Now, good angels    Fly o'er thy royal head, and shade thy person    Under their blessed wings!  KING. Now, by thy looks    I guess thy message. Is the Queen deliver'd?    Say ay, and of a boy.  OLD LADY. Ay, ay, my liege;    And of a lovely boy. The God of Heaven    Both now and ever bless her! 'Tis a girl,    Promises boys hereafter. Sir, your queen    Desires your visitation, and to be    Acquainted with this stranger; 'tis as like you    As cherry is to cherry.  KING. Lovell!           Enter LOVELL  LOVELL. Sir?  KING. Give her an hundred marks. I'll to the Queen.            Exit  OLD LADY. An hundred marks? By this light, I'll ha' more!    An ordinary groom is for such payment.    I will have more, or scold it out of him.    Said I for this the girl was like to him! I'll    Have more, or else unsay't; and now, while 'tis hot,    I'll put it to the issue.                                  ExeuntACT V. SCENE 2.Lobby before the Council ChamberEnter CRANMER, ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY  CRANMER. I hope I am not too late; and yet the gentleman    That was sent to me from the Council pray'd me    To make great haste. All fast? What means this? Ho!    Who waits there? Sure you know me?           Enter KEEPER  KEEPER. Yes, my lord;    But yet I cannot help you.  CRANMER. Why?  KEEPER. Your Grace must wait till you be call'd for.           Enter DOCTOR BUTTS  CRANMER. So.  BUTTS.  [Aside]  This is a piece of malice. I am glad    I came this way so happily; the King    Shall understand it presently.                               Exit  CRANMER.  [Aside]  'Tis Butts,    The King's physician; as he pass'd along,    How earnestly he cast his eyes upon me!    Pray heaven he sound not my disgrace! For certain,    This is of purpose laid by some that hate me-    God turn their hearts! I never sought their malice-    To quench mine honour; they would shame to make me    Wait else at door, a fellow councillor,    'Mong boys, grooms, and lackeys. But their pleasures    Must be fulfill'd, and I attend with patience.         Enter the KING and BUTTS at window above  BUTTS. I'll show your Grace the strangest sight-  KING. What's that, Butts?  BUTTS. I think your Highness saw this many a day.  KING. Body a me, where is it?  BUTTS. There my lord:    The high promotion of his Grace of Canterbury;    Who holds his state at door, 'mongst pursuivants,    Pages, and footboys.  KING. Ha, 'tis he indeed.    Is this the honour they do one another?    'Tis well there's one above 'em yet. I had thought    They had parted so much honesty among 'em-    At least good manners-as not thus to suffer    A man of his place, and so near our favour,    To dance attendance on their lordships' pleasures,    And at the door too, like a post with packets.    By holy Mary, Butts, there's knavery!    Let 'em alone, and draw the curtain close;    We shall hear more anon.                                   ExeuntACT V. SCENE 3.The Council ChamberA Council table brought in, with chairs and stools, and placedunder the state. Enter LORD CHANCELLOR, places himself at the upper endof the table on the left band, a seat being left void above him,as for Canterbury's seat. DUKE OF SUFFOLK, DUKE OF NORFOLK, SURREY,LORD CHAMBERLAIN, GARDINER, seat themselves in order on each side;CROMWELL at lower end, as secretary. KEEPER at the door  CHANCELLOR. Speak to the business, master secretary;    Why are we met in council?  CROMWELL. Please your honours,    The chief cause concerns his Grace of Canterbury.  GARDINER. Has he had knowledge of it?  CROMWELL. Yes.  NORFOLK. Who waits there?  KEEPER. Without, my noble lords?  GARDINER. Yes.  KEEPER. My Lord Archbishop;    And has done half an hour, to know your pleasures.  CHANCELLOR. Let him come in.  KEEPER. Your Grace may enter now.      CRANMER approaches the Council table  CHANCELLOR. My good Lord Archbishop, I am very sorry    To sit here at this present, and behold    That chair stand empty; but we all are men,    In our own natures frail and capable    Of our flesh; few are angels; out of which frailty    And want of wisdom, you, that best should teach us,    Have misdemean'd yourself, and not a little,    Toward the King first, then his laws, in filling    The whole realm by your teaching and your chaplains-    For so we are inform'd-with new opinions,    Divers and dangerous; which are heresies,    And, not reform'd, may prove pernicious.  GARDINER. Which reformation must be sudden too,    My noble lords; for those that tame wild horses    Pace 'em not in their hands to make 'em gentle,    But stop their mouth with stubborn bits and spur 'em    Till they obey the manage. If we suffer,    Out of our easiness and childish pity    To one man's honour, this contagious sickness,    Farewell all physic; and what follows then?    Commotions, uproars, with a general taint    Of the whole state; as of late days our neighbours,    The upper Germany, can dearly witness,    Yet freshly pitied in our memories.  CRANMER. My good lords, hitherto in all the progress    Both of my life and office, I have labour'd,    And with no little study, that my teaching    And the strong course of my authority    Might go one way, and safely; and the end    Was ever to do well. Nor is there living-    I speak it with a single heart, my lords-    A man that more detests, more stirs against,    Both in his private conscience and his place,    Defacers of a public peace than I do.    Pray heaven the King may never find a heart    With less allegiance in it! Men that make    Envy and crooked malice nourishment    Dare bite the best. I do beseech your lordships    That, in this case of justice, my accusers,    Be what they will, may stand forth face to face    And freely urge against me.  SUFFOLK. Nay, my lord,    That cannot be; you are a councillor,    And by that virtue no man dare accuse you.  GARDINER. My lord, because we have business of more moment,    We will be short with you. 'Tis his Highness' pleasure    And our consent, for better trial of you,    From hence you be committed to the Tower;    Where, being but a private man again,    You shall know many dare accuse you boldly,    More than, I fear, you are provided for.  CRANMER. Ah, my good Lord of Winchester, I thank you;    You are always my good friend; if your will pass,    I shall both find your lordship judge and juror,    You are so merciful. I see your end-    'Tis my undoing. Love and meekness, lord,    Become a churchman better than ambition;    Win straying souls with modesty again,    Cast none away. That I shall clear myself,    Lay all the weight ye can upon my patience,    I make as little doubt as you do conscience    In doing daily wrongs. I could say more,    But reverence to your calling makes me modest.  GARDINER. My lord, my lord, you are a sectary;    That's the plain truth. Your painted gloss discovers,    To men that understand you, words and weakness.  CROMWELL. My Lord of Winchester, y'are a little,    By your good favour, too sharp; men so noble,    However faulty, yet should find respect    For what they have been; 'tis a cruelty    To load a falling man.  GARDINER. Good Master Secretary,    I cry your honour mercy; you may, worst    Of all this table, say so.  CROMWELL. Why, my lord?  GARDINER. Do not I know you for a favourer    Of this new sect? Ye are not sound.  CROMWELL. Not sound?  GARDINER. Not sound, I say.  CROMWELL. Would you were half so honest!    Men's prayers then would seek you, not their fears.  GARDINER. I shall remember this bold language.  CROMWELL. Do.    Remember your bold life too.  CHANCELLOR. This is too much;    Forbear, for shame, my lords.  GARDINER. I have done.  CROMWELL. And I.  CHANCELLOR. Then thus for you, my lord: it stands agreed,    I take it, by all voices, that forthwith    You be convey'd to th' Tower a prisoner;    There to remain till the King's further pleasure    Be known unto us. Are you all agreed, lords?  ALL. We are.  CRANMER. Is there no other way of mercy,    But I must needs to th' Tower, my lords?  GARDINER. What other    Would you expect? You are strangely troublesome.    Let some o' th' guard be ready there.           Enter the guard  CRANMER. For me?    Must I go like a traitor thither?  GARDINER. Receive him,    And see him safe i' th' Tower.  CRANMER. Stay, good my lords,    I have a little yet to say. Look there, my lords;    By virtue of that ring I take my cause    Out of the gripes of cruel men and give it    To a most noble judge, the King my master.  CHAMBERLAIN. This is the King's ring.  SURREY. 'Tis no counterfeit.  SUFFOLK. 'Tis the right ring, by heav'n. I told ye all,    When we first put this dangerous stone a-rolling,    'Twould fall upon ourselves.  NORFOLK. Do you think, my lords,    The King will suffer but the little finger    Of this man to be vex'd?  CHAMBERLAIN. 'Tis now too certain;    How much more is his life in value with him!    Would I were fairly out on't!  CROMWELL. My mind gave me,    In seeking tales and informations    Against this man-whose honesty the devil    And his disciples only envy at-    Ye blew the fire that burns ye. Now have at ye!      Enter the KING frowning on them; he takes his seat  GARDINER. Dread sovereign, how much are we bound to heaven    In daily thanks, that gave us such a prince;    Not only good and wise but most religious;    One that in all obedience makes the church    The chief aim of his honour and, to strengthen    That holy duty, out of dear respect,    His royal self in judgment comes to hear    The cause betwixt her and this great offender.  KING. You were ever good at sudden commendations,    Bishop of Winchester. But know I come not    To hear such flattery now, and in my presence    They are too thin and bare to hide offences.    To me you cannot reach you play the spaniel,    And think with wagging of your tongue to win me;    But whatsoe'er thou tak'st me for, I'm sure    Thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody.    [To CRANMER]  Good man, sit down. Now let me see the proudest    He that dares most but wag his finger at thee.    By all that's holy, he had better starve    Than but once think this place becomes thee not.  SURREY. May it please your Grace-  KING. No, sir, it does not please me.    I had thought I had had men of some understanding    And wisdom of my Council; but I find none.    Was it discretion, lords, to let this man,    This good man-few of you deserve that title-    This honest man, wait like a lousy footboy    At chamber door? and one as great as you are?    Why, what a shame was this! Did my commission    Bid ye so far forget yourselves? I gave ye    Power as he was a councillor to try him,    Not as a groom. There's some of ye, I see,    More out of malice than integrity,    Would try him to the utmost, had ye mean;    Which ye shall never have while I live.  CHANCELLOR. Thus far,    My most dread sovereign, may it like your Grace    To let my tongue excuse all. What was purpos'd    concerning his imprisonment was rather-    If there be faith in men-meant for his trial    And fair purgation to the world, than malice,    I'm sure, in me.  KING. Well, well, my lords, respect him;    Take him, and use him well, he's worthy of it.    I will say thus much for him: if a prince    May be beholding to a subject,    Am for his love and service so to him.    Make me no more ado, but all embrace him;    Be friends, for shame, my lords! My Lord of Canterbury,    I have a suit which you must not deny me:    That is, a fair young maid that yet wants baptism;    You must be godfather, and answer for her.  CRANMER. The greatest monarch now alive may glory    In such an honour; how may I deserve it,    That am a poor and humble subject to you?  KING. Come, come, my lord, you'd spare your spoons. You      shall have    Two noble partners with you: the old Duchess of Norfolk    And Lady Marquis Dorset. Will these please you?    Once more, my Lord of Winchester, I charge you,    Embrace and love this man.  GARDINER. With a true heart    And brother-love I do it.  CRANMER. And let heaven    Witness how dear I hold this confirmation.  KING. Good man, those joyful tears show thy true heart.    The common voice, I see, is verified    Of thee, which says thus: 'Do my Lord of Canterbury    A shrewd turn and he's your friend for ever.'    Come, lords, we trifle time away; I long    To have this young one made a Christian.    As I have made ye one, lords, one remain;    So I grow stronger, you more honour gain.                  ExeuntACT V. SCENE 4.The palace yardNoise and tumult within. Enter PORTER and his MAN  PORTER. You'll leave your noise anon, ye rascals. Do you    take the court for Paris garden? Ye rude slaves, leave your    gaping.    [Within: Good master porter, I belong to th' larder.]  PORTER. Belong to th' gallows, and be hang'd, ye rogue! Is    this a place to roar in? Fetch me a dozen crab-tree staves,    and strong ones; these are but switches to 'em. I'll scratch    your heads. You must be seeing christenings? Do you look    for ale and cakes here, you rude rascals?  MAN. Pray, sir, be patient; 'tis as much impossible,    Unless we sweep 'em from the door with cannons,    To scatter 'em as 'tis to make 'em sleep    On May-day morning; which will never be.    We may as well push against Paul's as stir 'em.  PORTER. How got they in, and be hang'd?  MAN. Alas, I know not: how gets the tide in?    As much as one sound cudgel of four foot-    You see the poor remainder-could distribute,    I made no spare, sir.  PORTER. You did nothing, sir.  MAN. I am not Samson, nor Sir Guy, nor Colbrand,    To mow 'em down before me; but if I spar'd any    That had a head to hit, either young or old,    He or she, cuckold or cuckold-maker,    Let me ne'er hope to see a chine again;    And that I would not for a cow, God save her!    [ Within: Do you hear, master porter?]  PORTER. I shall be with you presently, good master puppy.    Keep the door close, sirrah.  MAN. What would you have me do?  PORTER. What should you do, but knock 'em down by th'    dozens? Is this Moorfields to muster in? Or have we some    strange Indian with the great tool come to court, the    women so besiege us? Bless me, what a fry of fornication    is at door! On my Christian conscience, this one christening    will beget a thousand: here will be father, godfather,    and all together.  MAN. The spoons will be the bigger, sir. There is a fellow    somewhat near the door, he should be a brazier by his    face, for, o' my conscience, twenty of the dog-days now    reign in's nose; all that stand about him are under the line,    they need no other penance. That fire-drake did I hit three    times on the head, and three times was his nose discharged    against me; he stands there like a mortar-piece, to blow us.    There was a haberdasher's wife of small wit near him, that    rail'd upon me till her pink'd porringer fell off her head,    for kindling such a combustion in the state. I miss'd the    meteor once, and hit that woman, who cried out 'Clubs!'    when I might see from far some forty truncheoners draw    to her succour, which were the hope o' th' Strand, where    she was quartered. They fell on; I made good my place.    At length they came to th' broomstaff to me; I defied 'em    still; when suddenly a file of boys behind 'em, loose shot,    deliver'd such a show'r of pebbles that I was fain to draw    mine honour in and let 'em win the work: the devil was    amongst 'em, I think surely.  PORTER. These are the youths that thunder at a playhouse    and fight for bitten apples; that no audience but the tribulation    of Tower-hill or the limbs of Limehouse, their dear    brothers, are able to endure. I have some of 'em in Limbo    Patrum, and there they are like to dance these three days;    besides the running banquet of two beadles that is to come.          Enter the LORD CHAMBERLAIN  CHAMBERLAIN. Mercy o' me, what a multitude are here!    They grow still too; from all parts they are coming,    As if we kept a fair here! Where are these porters,    These lazy knaves? Y'have made a fine hand, fellows.    There's a trim rabble let in: are all these    Your faithful friends o' th' suburbs? We shall have    Great store of room, no doubt, left for the ladies,    When they pass back from the christening.  PORTER. An't please your honour,    We are but men; and what so many may do,    Not being torn a pieces, we have done.    An army cannot rule 'em.  CHAMBERLAIN. As I live,    If the King blame me for't, I'll lay ye an    By th' heels, and suddenly; and on your heads    Clap round fines for neglect. Y'are lazy knaves;    And here ye lie baiting of bombards, when    Ye should do service. Hark! the trumpets sound;    Th' are come already from the christening.    Go break among the press and find a way out    To let the troops pass fairly, or I'll find    A Marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months.  PORTER. Make way there for the Princess.  MAN. You great fellow,    Stand close up, or I'll make your head ache.  PORTER.

SCENE 5.The palaceEnter TRUMPETS, sounding; then two ALDERMEN, LORD MAYOR, GARTER, CRANMER,DUKE OF NORFOLK, with his marshal's staff, DUKE OF SUFFOLK,two Noblemen bearing great standing-bowls for the christening gifts;then four Noblemen bearing a canopy, under which the DUCHESS OF NORFOLK,godmother, bearing the CHILD richly habited in a mantle, etc.,train borne by a LADY; then follows the MARCHIONESS DORSET,the other godmother, and LADIES. The troop pass once about the stage,and GARTER speaks  GARTER. Heaven, from thy endless goodness, send prosperous    life, long and ever-happy, to the high and mighty    Princess of England, Elizabeth!           Flourish. Enter KING and guard  CRANMER.  [Kneeling]  And to your royal Grace and the      good Queen!    My noble partners and myself thus pray:    All comfort, joy, in this most gracious lady,    Heaven ever laid up to make parents happy,    May hourly fall upon ye!  KING. Thank you, good Lord Archbishop.    What is her name?  CRANMER. Elizabeth.  KING. Stand up, lord.                   [The KING kisses the child]    With this kiss take my blessing: God protect thee!    Into whose hand I give thy life.  CRANMER. Amen.  KING. My noble gossips, y'have been too prodigal;    I thank ye heartily. So shall this lady,    When she has so much English.  CRANMER. Let me speak, sir,    For heaven now bids me; and the words I utter    Let none think flattery, for they'll find 'em truth.    This royal infant-heaven still move about her!-    Though in her cradle, yet now promises    Upon this land a thousand blessings,    Which time shall bring to ripeness. She shall be-    But few now living can behold that goodness-    A pattern to all princes living with her,    And all that shall succeed. Saba was never    More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue    Than this pure soul shall be. All princely graces    That mould up such a mighty piece as this is,    With all the virtues that attend the good,    Shall still be doubled on her. Truth shall nurse her,    Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her;    She shall be lov'd and fear'd. Her own shall bless her:    Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,    And hang their heads with sorrow. Good grows with her;    In her days every man shall eat in safety    Under his own vine what he plants, and sing    The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours.    God shall be truly known; and those about her    From her shall read the perfect ways of honour,    And by those claim their greatness, not by blood.    Nor shall this peace sleep with her; but as when    The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix    Her ashes new create another heir    As great in admiration as herself,    So shall she leave her blessedness to one-    When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness-    Who from the sacred ashes of her honour    Shall star-like rise, as great in fame as she was,    And so stand fix'd. Peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,    That were the servants to this chosen infant,    Shall then be his, and like a vine grow to him;    Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine,    His honour and the greatness of his name    Shall be, and make new nations; he shall flourish,    And like a mountain cedar reach his branches    To all the plains about him; our children's children    Shall see this and bless heaven.  KING. Thou speakest wonders.  CRANMER. She shall be, to the happiness of England,    An aged princess; many days shall see her,    And yet no day without a deed to crown it.    Would I had known no more! But she must die-    She must, the saints must have her-yet a virgin;    A most unspotted lily shall she pass    To th' ground, and all the world shall mourn her.  KING. O Lord Archbishop,    Thou hast made me now a man; never before    This happy child did I get anything.    This oracle of comfort has so pleas'd me    That when I am in heaven I shall desire    To see what this child does, and praise my Maker.    I thank ye all. To you, my good Lord Mayor,    And you, good brethren, I am much beholding;    I have receiv'd much honour by your presence,    And ye shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords;    Ye must all see the Queen, and she must thank ye,    She will be sick else. This day, no man think    Has business at his house; for all shall stay.    This little one shall make it holiday.                     ExeuntKING_HENRY_VIII|EPILOGUE              THE EPILOGUE.    'Tis ten to one this play can never please    All that are here. Some come to take their ease    And sleep an act or two; but those, we fear,    W'have frighted with our trumpets; so, 'tis clear,    They'll say 'tis nought; others to hear the city    Abus'd extremely, and to cry 'That's witty!'    Which we have not done neither; that, I fear,    All the expected good w'are like to hear    For this play at this time is only in    The merciful construction of good women;    For such a one we show'd 'em. If they smile    And say 'twill do, I know within a while    All the best men are ours; for 'tis ill hap    If they hold when their ladies bid 'em clap.THE END
