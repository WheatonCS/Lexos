The Tragedie of _Dido_ Queene
_of Carthage._


_Here the Curtaines draw, there is discovered_ Iupiter _dandling_
Ganimed _upon his knee, and_ Mercury _lying asleepe_.

_Iup._ Come gentle _Ganimed_ and play with me,
I loue thee well, say _Iuno_ what she will.

_Gan._ I am much better for your worthles loue,
That will not shield me from her shrewith blowes:
To day when as I fild into your cups,
And held the cloath of pleasance whiles you dranke,
She reacht me such a rap for that I spilde,
As made the bloud run downe about mine eares.

_Iup._ What? dares she strike the darling of my thoughts?
By _Saturnes_ soule, and this earth threatning aire,
That shaken thrise, makes Natures buildings quake,
I vow, if she but once frowne on thee more,
To hang her meteor like twixt heauen and earth,
And bind her hand and foote with golden cordes,
As once I did for harming _Hercules_.

_Gan._ Might I but see that pretie sport a foote,
O how would I with _Helens_ brother laugh,
And bring the Gods to wonder at the game:
Sweet _Iupiter_, if ere I pleasde thine eye,
Or seemed faire walde in with Egles wings,
Grace my immortall beautie with this boone,
And I will spend my time in thy bright armes.

_Iup._ What ist sweet wagge I should deny thy youth?
Whose face reflects such pleasure to mine eyes,
As I exhal'd with thy fire darting beames,
Haue oft driuen backe the horses of the night.
When as they would haue hal'd thee from my sight:
Sit on my knee, and call for thy content,
Controule proud Fate, and cut the thred of time,
Why are not all the Gods at thy commaund,
And heauen and earth the bounds of thy delight?
_Vulcan_ shall daunce to make thee laughing sport,
And my nine Daughters sing when thou art sad,
From _Iunos_ bird Ile pluck her spotted pride,
To make thee fannes wherewith to coole thy face,
And _Venus_ Swannes shall shed their siluer downe,
To sweeten out the slumbers of thy bed:
_Hermes_ no more shall shew the world his wings,
If that thy fancie in his feathers dwell,
But as this one Ile teare them all from him,
Doe thou but say their colour pleaseth me:
Hold here my little loue these linked gems,
My _Iuno_ ware vpon her marriage day,
Put thou about thy necke my owne sweet heart,
And tricke thy armes and shoulders with my theft.

_Gan._ I would haue a iewell for mine eare,
And a fine brouch to put in my hat,
And then Ile hugge with you an hundred times.

_Iup._ And shall haue _Ganimed_, if thou wilt be my loue.

_Enter Venus._

_Venus._ I this is it, you can sit toying there,
And playing with that female wanton boy,
Whiles my _Æneas_ wanders on the Seas,
And rests a pray to euery billowes pride.
_Iuno_, false _Iuno_ in her Chariots pompe,
Drawne through the heauens by Steedes of _Boreas_ brood,
Made _Hebe_ to direct her ayrie wheeles
Into the windie countrie of the clowdes,
Where finding _Æolus_ intrencht with stormes,
And guarded with a thousand grislie ghosts,
She humbly did beseech him for our bane,
And charg'd him drowne my sonne with all his traine.
Then gan the windes breake ope their brazen doores,
And all _Æolia_ to be vp in armes:
Poore _Troy_ must now be sackt vpon the Sea,
And _Neptunes_ waues be enuious men of warre,
_Epeus_ horse to _Ætnas_ hill transformd,
Prepared stands to wracke their woodden walles,
And _Æolus_ like _Agamemnon_ sounds
The surges, his fierce souldiers to the spoyle:
See how the night _Ulysses_-like comes forth,
And intercepts the day as _Dolon_ erst:
Ay me! the Starres supprisde like _Rhesus_ Steedes,
Are drawne by darknes forth _Astræus_ tents.
What shall I doe to saue thee my sweet boy?
When as the waues doe threat our Chrystall world,
And _Proteus_ raising hils of flouds on high,
Entends ere long to sport him in the skie.
False _Iupiter_, rewardst thou vertue so?
What? is not pietie exempt from woe?
Then dye _Æneas_ in thine innocence,
Since that religion hath no recompence.

_Iup._ Content thee _Cytherea_ in thy care,
Since thy _Æneas_ wandring fate is firme,
Whose wearie lims shall shortly make repose,
In those faire walles I promist him of yore:
But first in bloud must his good fortune bud,
Before he be the Lord of _Turnus_ towne,
Or force her smile that hetherto hath frownd:
Three winters shall he with the Rutiles warre,
And in the end subdue them with his sword,
And full three Sommers likewise shall he waste,
In mannaging those fierce barbarian mindes:
Which once performd, poore _Troy_ so long supprest,
From forth her ashes shall aduance her head,
And flourish once againe that erst was dead:
But bright _Ascanius_ beauties better worke,
Who with the Sunne deuides one radiant shape,
Shall build his throne amidst those starrie towers,
That earth-borne _Atlas_ groning vnderprops:
No bounds but heauen shall bound his Emperie,
Whose azured gates enchased with his name,
Shall make the morning halt her gray vprise,
To feede her eyes with his engrauen fame.
Thus in stoute _Hectors_ race three hundred yeares,
The Romane Scepter royall shall remaine,
Till that a Princesse priest conceau'd by _Mars_,
Shall yeeld to dignitie a dubble birth,
Who will eternish _Troy_ in their attempts.

_Venus._ How may I credite these thy flattering termes,
When yet both sea and sands beset their ships,
And _Phœbus_ as in stygian pooles, refraines
To taint his tresses in the Tyrrhen maine?

_Iup._ I will take order for that presently:
_Hermes_ awake, and haste to _Neptunes_ realme,
Whereas the Wind-god warring now with Fate,
Besiege the ofspring of our kingly loynes,
Charge him from me to turne his stormie powers,
And fetter them in _Vulcans_ sturdie brasse,
That durst thus proudly wrong our kinsmans peace.
_Venus_ farewell, thy sonne shall be our care:
Come _Ganimed_, we must about this geare.

_Exeunt Iupiter cum Ganimed._

_Venus._ Disquiet Seas lay downe your swelling lookes,
And court _Æneas_ with your calmie cheere,
Whose beautious burden well might make you proude,
Had not the heauens conceau'd with hel-borne clowdes,
Vaild his resplendant glorie from your view,
For my sake pitie him _Oceanus_,
That erst-while issued from thy watrie loynes,
And had my being from thy bubling froth:
_Triton_ I know hath fild his trumpe with _Troy_,
And therefore will take pitie on his toyle,
And call both _Thetis_ and _Cimodoæ_,
To succour him in this extremitie.

_Enter Æneas with Ascanius, with one or two more._

What? doe I see my sonne now come on shoare:
_Venus_, how art thou compast with content,
The while thine eyes attract their sought for ioyes:
Great _Iupiter_, still honourd maist thou be,
For this so friendly ayde in time of neede.
Here in this bush disguised will I stand,
Whiles my _Æneas_ spends himselfe in plaints,
And heauen and earth with his vnrest acquaints.

_Æn._ You sonnes of care, companions of my course,
_Priams_ misfortune followes vs by sea,
And _Helens_ rape doth haunt thee at the heeles.
How many dangers haue we ouer past?
Both barking _Scilla_, and the sounding Rocks,
The _Cyclops_ shelues, and grim _Ceranias_ seate
Haue you oregone, and yet remaine aliue!
Pluck vp your hearts, since fate still rests our friend,
And chaunging heauens may those good daies returne,
Which _Pergama_ did vaunt in all her pride.

_Acha._ Braue Prince of _Troy_, thou onely art our God,
That by thy vertues freest vs from annoy,
And makes our hopes suruiue to cunning ioyes:
Doe thou but smile, and clowdie heauen will cleare,
Whose night and day descendeth from thy browes:
Though we be now in extreame miserie,
And rest the map of weatherbeaten woe:
Yet shall the aged Sunne shed forth his aire,
To make vs liue vnto our former heate,
And euery beast the forrest doth send forth,
Bequeath her young ones to our scanted foode.

_Asca._ Father I faint, good father giue me meate.

_Æn._ Alas sweet boy, thou must be still a while,
Till we haue fire to dresse the meate we kild:
Gentle _Achates_, reach the Tinder boxe,
That we may make a fire to warme vs with,
And rost our new found victuals on this shoare.

_Venus._ See what strange arts necessitie findes out,
How neere my sweet _Æneas_ art thou driuen?

_Æn._ Hold, take this candle and goe light a fire,
You shall haue leaues and windfall bowes enow
Neere to these woods, to rost your meate withall:
_Ascanius_, goe and drie thy drenched lims,
Whiles I with my _Achates_ roaue abroad,
To know what coast the winde hath driuen vs on,
Or whether men or beasts inhabite it.

_Acha._ The ayre is pleasant, and the soyle most fit
For Cities, and societies supports:
Yet much I maruell that I cannot finde,
No steps of men imprinted in the earth.

_Venus._ Now is the time for me to play my part:
Hoe yong men, saw you as you came
Any of all my Sisters wandring here?
Hauing a quiuer girded to her side,
And cloathed in a spotted Leopards skin.

_Æn._ I neither saw nor heard of any such:
But what may I faire Virgin call your name?
Whose lookes set forth no mortall forme to view,
Nor speech bewraies ought humaine in thy birth,
Thou art a Goddesse that delud'st our eyes,
And shrowdes thy beautie in this borrowd shape;
But whether thou the Sunnes bright Sister be,
Or one of chast _Dianas_ fellow Nimphs,
Liue happie in the height of all content,
And lighten our extreames with this one boone,
As to instruct us vnder what good heauen
We breathe as now, and what this world is calde,
On which by tempests furie we are cast,
Tell vs, O tell vs that are ignorant,
And this right hand shall make thy Altars crack
With mountaine heapes of milke white Sacrifize.

_Venus._ Such honour, stranger, doe I not affect:
It is the vse for Turen maides to weare
Their bowe and quiuer in this modest sort,
And suite themselues in purple for the nonce,
That they may trip more lightly ore the lawndes,
And ouertake the tusked Bore in chase.
But for the land whereof thou doest enquire,
It is the punick kingdome rich and strong,
Adioyning on _Agenors_ stately towne,
The kingly seate of Southerne _Libia_,
Whereas Sidonian _Dido_ rules as Queene.
But what are you that aske of me these things?
Whence may you come, or whither will you goe?

_Æn._ Of _Troy_ am I, _Æneas_ is my name,
Who driuen by warre from forth my natiue world,
Put sailes to sea to seeke out _Italy_;
And my diuine descent from sceptred _Iove_,
With twise twelue Phrigian ships I plowed the deepe,
And made that way my mother _Venus_ led:
But of them all scarce seuen doe anchor safe,
And they so wrackt and weltred by the waues,
As euery tide tilts twixt their oken sides:
And all of them vnburdened of their loade,
Are ballassed with billowes watrie weight.
But haples I, God wot, poore and vnknowne,
Doe trace these Libian deserts all despisde,
Exild forth _Europe_ and wide _Asia_ both,
And haue not any couerture but heauen.

_Venus._ Fortune hath fauord thee what ere thou be,
In sending thee vnto this curteous Coast:
A Gods name on and hast thee to the Court,
Where _Dido_ will receiue ye with her smiles:
And for thy ships which thou supposest lost,
Not one of them hath perisht in the storme,
But are ariued safe not farre from hence:
And so I leaue thee to thy fortunes lot,
Wishing good lucke vnto thy wandring steps.  _Exit_.

_Æn._ _Achates_, tis my mother that is fled,
I know her by the mouings of her feete:
Stay gentle _Venus_, flye not from thy sonne,
Too cruell, why wilt thou forsake me thus?
Or in these shades deceiu'st mine eye so oft?
Why talke we not together hand in hand?
And tell our griefes in more familiar termes:
But thou art gone and leau'st me here alone,
To dull the ayre with my discoursiue moane. _Exit_.

_Enter Illioneus, and Cloanthes._

_Illio._ Follow ye Troians, follow this braue Lord,
And plaine to him the summe of your distresse.

_Iar._ Why, what are you, or wherefore doe you sewe?

_Illio._ Wretches of _Troy_, enuied of the windes,
That craue such fauour at your honors feete,
As poore distressed miserie may pleade:
Saue, saue, O saue our ships from cruell fire,
That doe complaine the wounds of thousand waues,
And spare our liues whom euery spite pursues.
We come not we to wrong your Libian Gods,
Or steale your houshold lares from their shrines:
Our hands are not prepar'd to lawles spoyle,
Nor armed to offend in any kind:
Such force is farre from our vnweaponed thoughts,
Whose fading weale of victorie forsooke,
Forbids all hope to harbour neere our hearts.

_Iar._ But tell me Troians, Troians if you be,
Vnto what fruitfull quarters were ye bound,
Before that _Boreas_ buckled with your sailes?

_Cloan._ There is a place _Hesperia_ term'd by vs,
An ancient Empire, famoused for armes,
And fertile in faire _Ceres_ furrowed wealth,
Which now we call _Italia_ of his name,
That in such peace long time did rule the same:
Thither made we,
When suddenly gloomie _Orion_ rose,
And led our ships into the shallow sands,
Whereas the Southerne winde with brackish breath,
Disperst them all amongst the wrackfull Rockes:
From thence a fewe of vs escapt to land,
The rest we feare are foulded in the flouds.

_Iar._ Braue men at armes, abandon fruitles feares,
Since Carthage knowes to entertaine distresse.

_Serg._ I but the barbarous sort doe threat our ships,
And will not let vs lodge vpon the sands:
In multitudes they swarme vnto the shoare,
And from the first earth interdict our feete.

_Iar._ My selfe will see they shall not trouble ye,
Your men and you shall banquet in our Court,
And euery Troian be as welcome here,
As _Iupiter_ to sillie _Vausis_ house:
Come in with me, Ile bring you to my Queene,
Who shall confirme my words with further deedes.

_Serg._ Thankes gentle Lord for such vnlookt for grace,
Might we but once more see _Æneas_ face,
Then would we hope to quite such friendly turnes,
As shall surpasse the wonder of our speech.




Actus 2.


_Enter Æneas, Achates, and Ascanius._

_Æn._ Where am I now? these should be Carthage walles.

_Acha._ Why stands my sweete _Æneas_ thus amazde?

_Æn._ O my _Achates_, Theban _Niobe_,
Who for her sonnes death wept out life and breath,
And drie with griefe was turnd into a stone,
Had not such passions in her head as I.
Me thinkes that towne there should be _Troy_, yon _Idas_ hill,
There _Zanthus_ streame, because here's _Priamus_,
And when I know it is not, then I dye.

_Ach._ And in this humor is _Achates_ to,
I cannot choose but fall vpon my knees,
And kisse his hand: O where is _Hecuba_,
Here she was wont to sit, but sauing ayre
Is nothing here, and what is this but stone?

_Æn._ O yet this stone doth make _Æneas_ weepe,
And would my prayers (as _Pigmalions_ did)
Could giue it life, that vnder his conduct
We might saile backe to _Troy_ and be reuengde
On these hard harted Grecians; which reioyce
That nothing now is left of _Priamus_:
O _Priamus_ is left and this is he,
Come, come abourd, pursue the hatefull Greekes.

_Acha._ What means _Æneas_?

_Æn._ _Achates_ though mine eyes say this is stone,
Yet thinkes my minde that this is _Priamus_:
And when my grieued heart sighes and sayes no,
Then would it leape out to giue _Priam_ life:
O were I not at all so thou mightst be.
_Achates_, see King _Priam_ wags his hand,
He is aliue, _Troy_ is not ouercome.

_Ach._ Thy mind _Æneas_ that would haue it so
Deludes thy eye sight, _Priamus_ is dead.

_Æn._ Ah _Troy_ is sackt, and _Priamus_ is dead,
And why should poore _Æneas_ be aliue?

_Asca._ Sweete father leaue to weepe, this is not he:
For were it _Priam_ he would smile on me.

_Acha._ _Æneas_ see here come the Citizens,
Leaue to lament lest they laugh at our feares.

_Enter Cloanthus, Sergestus, Illioneus._

_Æn._ Lords of this towne, or whatsoeuer stile
Belongs vnto your name, vouchsafe of ruth
To tell vs who inhabits this faire towne,
What kind of people, and who gouernes them:
For we are strangers driuen on this shore,
And scarcely know within what Clime we are.

_Illio._ I heare _Æneas_ voyce, but see him not,
For none of these can be our Generall.

_Acha._ Like _Illioneus_ speakes this Noble man,
But _Illioneus_ goes not in such robes.

_Serg._ You are _Achates_, or I deciu'd.

_Acha._ _Æneas_ see _Sergestus_ or his ghost.

_Illio._ He meanes _Æneas_, let vs kisse his feete.

_Cloan._ It is our Captaine, see _Ascanius_.

_Serg._ Liue long _Æneas_ and _Ascanius_.

_Æn._ _Achates_, speake, for I am ouerioyed.

_Acha._ O _Illioneus_, art thou yet aliue?

_Illio._ Blest be the time I see _Achates_ face.

_Cloan._ Why turnes _Æneas_ from his trustie friends?

_Æn._ _Sergestus_, _Illioneus_ and the rest,
Your sight amazde me, O what destinies
Haue brought my sweete companions in such plight?
O tell me, for I long to be resolu'd.

_Illio._ Louely _Æneas_, these are Carthage walles,
And here Queene _Dido_ weares th'imperiall Crowne,
Who for _Troyes_ sake hath entertaind vs all,
And clad vs in these wealthie robes we weare.
Oft hath she askt vs vnder whom we seru'd,
And when we told her she would weepe for griefe,
Thinking the sea had swallowed vp thy ships,
And now she sees thee how will she reioyce?

_Serg._ See where her seruitors passe through the hall
Bearing a banket, _Dido_ is not farre.

_Illio._ Looke where she comes: _Æneas_ viewd her well.

_Æn._ Well may I view her, but she sees not me.

_Enter Dido and her traine._

_Dido._ What stranger art thou that doest eye me thus?

_Æn._ Sometime I was a Troian mightie Queene:
But _Troy_ is not, what shall I say I am?

_Illio._ Renowmed _Dido_, tis our Generall: warlike _Æneas_.

_Dido._ Warlike _Æneas_, and in these base robes?
Goe fetch the garment which _Sicheus_ ware:
Braue Prince, welcome to Carthage and to me,
Both happie that _Æneas_ is our guest:
Sit in this chaire and banquet with a Queene,
_Æneas_ is _Æneas_, were he clad
In weedes as bad as euer _Irus_ ware.

_Æn._ This is no seate for one thats comfortles,
May it please your grace to let _Æneas_ waite:
For though my birth be great, my fortunes meane,
Too meane to be companion to a Queene.

_Dido._ Thy fortune may be greater then thy birth,
Sit downe _Æneas_, sit in _Didos_ place,
And if this be thy sonne as I suppose,
Here let him sit, be merrie louely child.

_Æn._ This place beseemes me not, O pardon me.

_Dido._ Ile haue it so, _Æneas_ be content.

_Asca._ Madame, you shall be my mother.

_Dido._ And so I will sweete child: be merrie man,
Heres to thy better fortune and good starres.

_Æn._ In all humilitie I thanke your grace.

_Dido._ Remember who thou art, speake like thy selfe,
Humilitie belongs to common groomes.

_Æn._ And who so miserable as _Æneas_ is?

_Dido._ Lyes it in _Didos_ hands to make thee blest,
Then be assured thou art not miserable.

_Æn._ O _Priamus_, O _Troy_, oh _Hecuba_!

_Dido._ May I entreate thee to discourse at large,
And truely to how _Troy_ was ouercome:
For many tales goe of that Cities fall,
And scarcely doe agree vpon one poynt:
Some say _Antenor_ did betray the towne,
Others report twas _Sinons_ periurie:
But all in this that _Troy_ is ouercome,
And _Priam_ dead, yet how we heare no newes.

_Æn._ A wofull tale bids _Dido_ to vnfould,
Whose memorie like pale deaths stony mace,
Beates forth my senses from this troubled soule,
And makes _Æneas_ sinke at _Didos_ feete.

_Dido._ What faints _Æneas_ to remember _Troy_?
In whose defence he fought so valiantly:
Looke vp and speake.

_Æn._ Then speake _Æneas_ with _Achilles_ tongue,
And _Dido_ and you Carthaginian Peeres
Heare me, but yet with _Mirmidons_ harsh eares,
Daily inur'd to broyles and Massacres,
Lest you be mou'd too much with my sad tale.
The Grecian souldiers tired with ten yeares warre;
Began to crye, let vs vnto our ships,
_Troy_ is inuincible, why stay we here?
With whose outcryes _Atrides_ being apal'd,
Summoned the Captaines to his princely tent,
Who looking on the scarres we Troians gaue,
Seeing the number of their men decreast,
And the remainder weake and out of heart,
Gaue vp their voyces to dislodge the Campe,
And so in troopes all marcht to _Tenedos_:
Where when they came, _Vlysses_ on the sand
Assayd with honey words to turne them backe:
And as he spoke to further his entent,
The windes did driue huge billowes to the shoare,
And heauen was darkned with tempestuous clowdes:
Then he alleag'd the Gods would haue them stay,
And prophecied _Troy_ should be ouercome:
And therewithall he calde false _Sinon_ forth,
A man compact of craft and periurie,
Whose ticing tongue was made of _Hermes_ pipe,
To force an hundred watchfull eyes to sleepe:
And him _Epeus_ hauing made the horse,
With sacrificing wreathes vpon his head,
_Vlysses_ sent to our vnhappie towne:
Who groueling in the mire of _Zanthus_ bankes,
His hands bound at his back, and both his eyes
Turnd vp to heauen as one resolu'd to dye,
Our Phrigian shepherd haled within the gates,
And brought vnto the Court of _Priamus_:
To whom he vsed action so pitifull,
Lookes so remorcefull, vowes so forcible,
As therewithall the old man ouercome,
Kist him, imbrast him, and vnloosde his bands,
And then, O _Dido_ pardon me.

_Dido._ Nay leaue not here, resolue me of the rest.

_Æn._ O th'inchaunting words of that base slaue,
Made him to thinke _Epeus_ pine-tree Horse
A sacrifize t'appease _Mineruas_ wrath:
The rather for that one _Laocoon_
Breaking a speare vpon his hollow breast,
Was with two winged Serpents stung to death.
Whereat agast, we were commanded straight
With reuerence to draw it into _Troy_.
In which vnhappie worke was I employd,
These hands did helpe to hale it to the gates,
Through which it could not enter twas so huge.
O had it neuer entred, _Troy_ had stood.
But _Priamus_ impatient of delay,
Inforst a wide breach in that rampierd wall,
Which thousand battering Rams could neuer pierce,
And so came in this fatall instrument:
At whose accursed feete as ouerioyed,
We banquetted till ouercome with wine,
Some surfetted, and others soundly slept.
Which _Sinon_ viewing, causde the Greekish spyes
To hast to _Tenedos_ and tell the Campe:
Then he vnlockt the Horse, and suddenly
From out his entrailes, _Neoptolemus_
Setting his speare vpon the ground, leapt forth,
And after him a thousand Grecians more,
In whose sterne faces shin'd the quenchles fire,
That after burnt the pride of _Asia_.
By this the Campe was come vnto the walles,
And through the breach did march into the streetes,
Where meeting with the rest, kill kill they cryed.
Frighted with this confused noyse, I rose,
And looking from a turret, might behold
Yong infants swimming in their parents bloud,
Headles carkasses piled vp in heapes,
Virgins halfe dead dragged by their golden haire,
And with maine force flung on a ring of pikes,
Old men with swords thrust through their aged sides,
Kneeling for mercie to a Greekish lad,
Who with steele Pol-axes dasht out their braines.
Then buckled I mine armour, drew my sword,
And thinking to goe downe, came _Hectors_ ghost
With ashie visage, blewish, sulphure eyes,
His armes torne from his shoulders, and his breast
Furrowd with wounds, and that which made me weepe,
Thongs at his heeles, by which _Achilles_ horse
Drew him in triumph through the Greekish Campe,
Burst from the earth, crying, _Æneas_ flye,
_Troy_ is a fire, the Grecians haue the towne,

_Dido._ O _Hector_ who weepes not to heare thy name?

_Æn._ Yet flung I forth, and desperate of my life,
Ran in the thickest throngs, and with this sword
Sent many of their sauadge ghosts to hell.
At last came _Pirrhus_ fell and full of ire.
His harnesse dropping bloud, and on his speare
The mangled head of _Priams_ yongest sonne,
And after him his band of Mirmidons,
With balles of wilde fire in their murdering pawes,
Which made the funerall flame that burnt faire _Troy_:
All which hemd me about, crying, this is he.

_Dido._ Ah, how could poore _Æneas_ scape their hands?

_Æn._ My mother _Venus_ iealous of my health,
Conuaid me from their crooked nets and bands:
So I escapt the furious _Pirrhus_ wrath:
Who then ran to the pallace of the King,
And at _Ioues_ Altar finding _Priamus_,
About whose withered necke hung _Hecuba_,
Foulding his hand in hers, and ioyntly both
Beating their breasts and falling on the ground,
He with his faulchions poynt raisde vp at once,
And with _Megeras_ eyes stared in their face,
Threatning a thousand deaths at euery glaunce.
To whom the aged King thus trembling spoke:
_Achilles_ sonne, remember what I was,
Father of fiftie sonnes, but they are slaine,
Lord of my fortune, but my fortunes turnd,
King of this Citie, but my _Troy_ is fired,
And now am neither father, Lord, nor King:
Yet who so wretched but desires to liue?
O let me liue, great _Neoptolemus_,
Not mou'd at all, but smiling at his teares,
This butcher whil'st his hands were yet held vp,
Treading vpon his breast, strooke off his hands.

_Dido._ O end _Æneas_, I can heare no more.

_Æn._ At which the franticke Queene leapt on his face,
And in his eyelids hanging by the nayles,
A little while prolong'd her husbands life:
At last the souldiers puld her by the heeles,
And swong her howling in the emptie ayre,
Which sent an eccho to the wounded King:
Whereat he lifted vp his bedred lims,
And would haue grappeld with _Achilles_ sonne,
Forgetting both his want of strength and hands,
Which he disdaining whiskt his sword about,
And with the wound thereof the King fell downe:
Then from the nauell to the throat at once,
He ript old _Priam_: at whose latter gaspe
_Ioues_ marble statue gan to bend the brow,
As lothing _Pirrhus_ for this wicked act:
Yet he vndaunted tooke his fathers flagge,
And dipt it in the old Kings chill cold bloud,
And then in triumph ran into the streetes,
Through which he could not passe for slaughtred men:
So leaning on his sword he stood stone still,
Viewing the fire wherewith rich _Ilion_ burnt.
By this I got my father on my backe,
This yong boy in mine armes, and by the hand
Led faire _Creusa_ my beloued wife,
When thou _Achates_ with thy sword mad'st way,
And we were round inuiron'd with the Greekes:
O there I lost my wife: and had not we
Fought manfully, I had not told this tale:
Yet manhood would not serue, of force we fled,
And as we went vnto our ships, thou knowest
We sawe _Cassandra_ sprauling in the streetes,
Whom _Aiax_ rauisht in _Dianas_ Fawne,
Her cheekes swolne with sighes, her haire all rent,
Whom I tooke vp to beare vnto our ships;
But suddenly the Grecians followed vs,
And I alas, was forst to let her lye.
Then got we to our ships, and being abourd,
_Polixena_ cryed out, _Æneas_ stay,
The Greekes pursue me, stay and take me in.
Moued with her voyce, I lept into the sea,
Thinking to beare her on my backe abourd:
For all our ships were launcht into the deepe,
And as I swomme, she standing on the shoare,
Was by the cruell Mirmidons surprizd,
And after by that _Pirrhus_ sacrifizde.

_Dido._ I dye with melting ruth, _Æneas_ leaue.

_Anna._ O what became of aged _Hecuba_?

_Iar._ How got _Æneas_ to the fleete againe?

_Dido._ But how scapt _Helen_, she that causde this warre?

_Æn._ _Achates_ speake, sorrow hath tired me quite.

_Acha._ What happened to the Queene we cannot shewe,
We heare they led her captiue into Greece,
As for _Æneas_ he swomme quickly backe,
And _Helena_ betraied _Diiphobus_
Her Louer, after _Alexander_ dyed,
And so was reconcil'd to _Menelaus_.

_Dido._ O had that ticing strumpet nere been borne:
Troian, thy ruthfull tale hath made me sad:
Come let vs thinke vpon some pleasing sport,
To rid me from these melancholly thoughts.

_Exeunt omnes._

_Enter Venus at another doore, and takes Ascanius by the sleeve._

_Venus._ Faire child stay thou with _Didos_ waiting maide,
Ile giue thee Sugar-almonds, sweete Conserues,
A siluer girdle, and a golden purse,
And this yong Prince shall be thy playfellow.

_Asca._ Are you Queene _Didos_ sonne?

_Cupid._ I, and my mother gaue me this fine bow.

_Asca._ Shall I haue such a quiuer and a bow?

_Venus._ Such bow, such quiuer, and such golden shafts,
Will _Dido_ giue to sweete _Ascanius_:
For _Didos_ sake I take thee in my armes,
And sticke these spangled feathers in thy hat,
Eate Comfites in mine armes, and I will sing.
Now is he fast asleepe, and in this groue
Amongst greene brakes Ile lay _Ascanius_,
And strewe him with sweete smelling Violets,
Blushing Roses, purple _Hyacinthe_:
These milke white Doues shall be his Centronels:
Who if that any seeke to doe him hurt,
Will quickly flye to _Citheidas_ fist.
Now _Cupid_ turne thee to _Ascanius_ shape,
And goe to _Dido_ who in stead of him
Will set thee on her lap and play with thee:
Then touch her white breast with this arrow head,
That she may dote vpon _Æneas_ loue:
And by that meanes repaire his broken ships,
Victuall his Souldiers, giue him wealthie gifts,
And he at last depart to _Italy_,
Or els in _Carthage_ make his kingly throne.

_Cupid._ I will faire mother, and so play my part,
As euery touch shall wound Queene _Didos_ heart.

_Venus._ Sleepe my sweete nephew in these cooling shades,
Free from the murmure of these running streames,
The crye of beasts, the ratling of the windes,
Or whisking of these leaues, all shall be still,
And nothing interrupt thy quiet sleepe,
Till I returne and take thee hence againe.  _Exit._




Actus 3. Scena I.


_Enter Cupid solus._

_Cupid._ Now _Cupid_ cause the Carthaginian Queene,
To be inamourd of thy brothers lookes,
Conuey this golden arrowe in thy sleeue,
Lest she imagine thou art _Venus_ sonne:
And when she strokes thee softly on the head,
Then shall I touch her breast and conquer her.

_Enter Iarbus, Anna, and Dido._

_Iar._ How long faire _Dido_ shall I pine for thee?
Tis not enough that thou doest graunt me loue,
But that I may enioy what I desire:
That loue is childish which consists in words.

_Dido._ _Iarbus_, know that thou of all my wooers
(And yet haue I had many mightier Kings)
Hast had the greatest fauours I could giue:
I feare me _Dido_ hath been counted light,
In being too familiar with _Iarbus_:
Albeit the Gods doe know no wanton thought
Had euer residence in _Didos_ breast.

_Iar._ But _Dido_ is the fauour I request.

_Dido._ Feare not _Iarbus_, _Dido_ may be thine.

_Anna._ Looke sister how _Æneas_ little sonne
Playes with your garments and imbraceth you.

_Cupid._ No _Dido_ will not take me in her armes,
I shall not be her sonne, she loues me not.

_Dido._ Weepe not sweet boy, thou shalt be _Didos_ sonne,
Sit in my lap and let me heare thee sing.
No more my child, now talke another while,
And tell me where learnst thou this pretie song?

_Cupid._ My cosin _Helen_ taught it me in _Troy_.

_Dido._ How louely is _Ascanius_ when he smiles?

_Cupid._ Will _Dido_ let me hang about her necke?

_Dido._ I wagge, and giue thee leaue to kisse her to.

_Cupid._ What will you giue me? now Ile haue this Fanne.

_Dido._ Take it _Ascanius_, for thy fathers sake.

_Iar._ Come _Dido_, leaue _Ascanius_, let vs walke.

_Dido._ Goe thou away, _Ascanius_ shall stay.

_Iar._ Vngentle Queene, is this thy loue to me?

_Dido._ O stay _Iarbus_, and Ile goe with thee.

_Cupid._ And if my mother goe, Ile follow her.

_Dido._ Why staiest thou here? thou art no loue of mine?

_Iar._ _Iarbus_ dye, seeing she abandons thee.

_Dido._ No, liue _Iarbus_, what hast thou deseru'd,
That I should say thou art no loue of mine?
Something thou hast deseru'd, away I say,
Depart from _Carthage_, come not in my sight.

_Iar._ Am I not King of rich _Getulia_?

_Dido._ _Iarbus_ pardon me, and stay a while.

_Cupid._ Mother, looke here.

_Dido._ What telst thou me of rich _Getulia_?
Am not I Queene of _Libia_? then depart.

_Iar._ I goe to feed the humour of my Loue,
Yet not from _Carthage_ for a thousand worlds.

_Dido._ _Iarbus_.

_Iar._ Doth _Dido_ call me backe?

_Dido._ No, but I charge thee neuer looke on me.

_Iar._ Then pull out both mine eyes, or let me dye. _Exit Iarb._

_Anna._ Wherefore doth _Dido_ bid _Iarbus_ goe?

_Dido._ Because his lothsome sight offends mine eye,
And in my thoughts is shrin'd another loue:
O _Anna_, didst thou know how sweet loue were,
Full soone wouldst thou abiure this single life.

_Anna._ Poore soule I know too well the sower of loue,
O that _Iarbus_ could but fancie me.

_Dido._ Is not _Æneas_ faire and beautifull?

_Anna._ Yes, and _Iarbus_ foule and fauourles.

_Dido._ Is he not eloquent in all his speech?

_Anna._ Yes, and _Iarbus_ rude and rusticall.

_Dido._ Name not _Iarbus_, but sweete _Anna_ say,
Is not _Æneas_ worthie _Didos_ loue?

_Anna._ O sister, were you Empresse of the world,
_Æneas_ well deserues to be your loue,
So lovely is he that where ere he goes,
The people swarme to gaze him in the face.

_Dido._ But tell them none shall gaze on him but I,
Lest their grosse eye-beames taint my louers cheekes:
_Anna_, good sister _Anna_ goe for him,
Lest with these sweete thoughts I melt cleane away.

_Anna._ Then sister youle abiure _Iarbus_ loue?

_Dido._ Yet must I heare that lothsome name againe?
Runne for _Æneas_, or Ile flye to him. _Exit Anna._

_Cupid._ You shall not hurt my father when he comes.

_Dido._ No, for thy sake Ile loue thy father well.
O dull conceipted _Dido_, that till now
Didst neuer thinke _Æneas_ beautifull:
But now for quittance of this ouersight,
Ile make me bracelets of his golden haire,
His glistering eyes shall be my looking glasse,
His lips an altar, where Ile offer vp
As many kisses as the Sea hath sands,
In stead of musicke I will heare him speake,
His lookes shall be my only Librarie,
And thou _Æneas, Didos_ treasurie,
In whose faire bosome I will locke more wealth,
Then twentie thousand Indiaes can affoord:
O here he comes, loue, loue, giue _Dido_ leaue
To be more modest then her thoughts admit,
Lest I be made a wonder to the world.
_Achates_, how doth _Carthage_ please your Lord?

_Acha._ That will _Æneas_ shewe your maiestie.

_Dido._ _Æneas_ art thou there?

_Æn._ I vnderstand your highnesse sent for me.

_Dido._ No, but now thou art here, tell me in sooth,
In what might _Dido_ highly pleasure thee.

_Æn._ So much haue I receiu'd at _Didos_ hands,
As without blushing I can aske no more:
Yet Queene of _Affricke_, are my ships vnrigd,
My Sailes all rent in sunder with the winde,
My Oares broken, and my Tackling lost,
Yea all my Nauie split with Rockes and Shelfes:
Nor Sterne nor Anchor haue our maimed Fleete,
Our Masts the furious windes strooke ouer bourd:
Which piteous wants if _Dido_ will supplie,
We will account her author of our liues.

_Dido._  _Æneas_, Ile repaire thy Troian ships,
Conditionally that thou wilt stay with me,
And let _Achates_ saile to _Italy_:
Ile giue thee tackling made of riueld gold,
Wound on the barkes of odoriferous trees,
Oares of massie Iuorie full of holes,
Through which the water shall delight to play:
Thy Anchors shall be hewed from Christall Rockes,
Which if thou lose shall shine aboue the waues;
The Masts whereon thy swelling sailes shall hang,
Hollow Pyramides of siluer plate:
The sailes of foulded Lawne, where shall be wrought
The warres of _Troy_, but not _Troyes_ ouerthrow:
For ballace, emptie _Didos_ treasurie,
Take what ye will, but leaue _Æneas_ here.
_Achates_, thou shalt be so meanly clad,
As Seaborne Nymphes shall swarme about thy ships,
And wanton Mermaides court thee with sweete songs,
Flinging in fauours of more soueraigne worth,
Then _Thetis_ hangs about _Apolloes_ necke,
So that _Æneas_ may but stay with me.

_Æn._ Wherefore would _Dido_ haue _Æneas_ stay?

_Dido._ To warre against my bordering enemies:
_Æneas_, thinke not _Dido_ is in loue:
For if that any man could conquer me,
I had been wedded ere _Æneas_ came:
See where the pictures of my suiters hang,
And are not these as faire as faire may be?

_Acha._ I saw this man at _Troy_ ere _Troy_ was sackt.

_Æn._ I this in _Greece_ when _Paris_ stole faire _Helen_.

_Illio._ This man and I were at _Olympus_ games.

_Serg._ I know this face, he is a Persian borne,
I traueld with him to _Ætolia_.

_Cloan._ And I in _Athens_ with this gentleman,
Vnlesse I be deceiu'd disputed once.

_Dido._ But speake _Æneas_, know you none of these?

_Æn._ No Madame, but it seemes that these are Kings.

_Dido._ All these and others which I neuer sawe,
Haue been most vrgent suiters for my loue,
Some came in person, others sent their Legats:
Yet none obtaind me, I am free from all,
And yet God knowes intangled vnto one.
This was an Orator, and thought by words
To compasse me, but yet he was deceiu'd:
And this a Spartan Courtier vaine and wilde,
But his fantastick humours pleasde not me:
This was _Alcion_, a Musition,
But playd he nere so sweet, I let him goe:
This was the wealthie King of _Thessaly_,
But I had gold enough and cast him off:
This _Meleagers_ sonne, a warlike Prince,
But weapons gree not with my tender yeares:
The rest are such as all the world well knowes,
Yet how I sweare by heauen and him I loue,
I was as farre from loue, as they from hate.

_Æn._ O happie shall he be whom _Dido_ loues.

_Dido._ Then neuer say that thou art miserable,
Because it may be thou shalt be my loue:
Yet boast not of it, for I loue thee not,
And yet I hate thee not: O if I speake
I shall betray my selfe: _Æneas_ speake,
We two will goe a hunting in the woods,
But not so much for thee, thou art but one,
As for _Achates_, and his followers.   _Exeunt._

_Enter Iuno to Ascanius asleepe._

_Iuno._ Here lyes my hate, _Æneas_ cursed brat,
The boy wherein false destinie delights,
The heire of furie, the fauorite of the face,
That vgly impe that shall outweare my wrath,
And wrong my deitie with high disgrace:
But I will take another order now,
And race th'eternall Register of time:
_Troy_ shall no more call him her second hope,
Nor _Venus_ triumph in his tender youth:
For here in spight of heauen Ile murder him,
And feede infection with his left out life:
Say _Paris_, now shall _Venus_ haue the ball?
Say vengeance, now shall her _Ascanius_ dye.
O no God wot, I cannot watch my time,
Nor quit good turnes with double fee downe told:
Tut, I am simple without made to hurt,
And haue no gall at all to grieue my foes:
But lustfull _Ioue_ and his adulterous child,
Shall finde it written on confusions front,
That onely _Iuno_ rules in _Rhamnuse_ towne.

_Enter Venus._

_Venus._ What should this meane? my Doues are back returnd,
Who warne me of such daunger prest at hand,
To harme my sweete _Ascanius_ louely life.
_Iuno_, my mortall foe, what make you here?
Auaunt old witch and trouble not my wits.

_Iuno._ Fie _Venus_, that such causeles words of wrath,
Should ere defile so faire a mouth as thine:
Are not we both sprong of celestiall rase,
And banquet as two Sisters with the Gods?
Why is it then displeasure should disioyne,
Whom kindred and acquaintance counites.

_Venus._ Out hatefull hag, thou wouldst haue slaine my sonne,
Had not my Doues discou'rd thy entent:
But I will teare thy eyes fro forth thy head,
And feast the birds with their bloud-shotten balles,
If thou but lay thy fingers on my boy.

_Iuno._ Is this then all the thankes that I shall haue,
For sauing him from Snakes and Serpents stings,
That would haue kild him sleeping as he lay?
What though I was offended with thy sonne,
And wrought him mickle woe on sea and land,
When for the hate of Troian _Ganimed_,
That was aduanced by my _Hebes_ shame,
And _Paris_ iudgement of the heauenly ball,
I mustred all the windes vnto his wracke,
And vrg'd each Element to his annoy:
Yet now I doe repent me of his ruth,
And wish that I had neuer wrongd him so:
Bootles I sawe it was to warre with fate,
That hath so many vnresisted friends:
Wherefore I chaunge my counsell with the time,
And planted loue where enuie erst had sprong.

_Venus._ Sister of _Ioue_, if that thy loue be such,
As these thy protestations doe paint forth,
We two as friends one fortune will deuide:
_Cupid_ shall lay his arrowes in thy lap,
And to a Scepter chaunge his golden shafts,
Fancie and modestie shall liue as mates,
And thy faire peacockes by my pigeons pearch:
Loue my _Æneas_, and desire is thine,
The day, the night, my Swannes, my sweetes are thine.

_Iuno._ More then melodious are these words to me,
That ouercioy my soule with their content:
_Venus_, sweete _Venus_, how may I deserue
Such amourous fauours at thy beautious hand?
But that thou maist more easilie perceiue,
How highly I doe prize this amitie,
Harke to a motion of eternall league,
Which I will make in quittance of thy loue:
Thy sonne thou knowest with _Dido_ now remaines,
And feedes his eyes with fauours of her Court,
She likewise in admyring spends her time,
And cannot talke nor thinke of ought but him:
Why should not they then ioyne in marriage,
And bring forth mightie Kings to Carthage towne,
Whom casualtie of sea hath made such friends?
And _Venus_, let there be a match confirmd
Betwixt these two, whose loues are so alike,
And both our Deities conioynd in one,
Shall chaine felicitie vnto their throne.

_Venus._ Well could I like this reconcilements meanes,
But much I feare my sonne will nere consent,
Whose armed soule alreadie on the sea,
Darts forth her light to _Lauinias_ shoare.

_Iuno._ Faire Queene of loue, I will deuorce these doubts,
And finde the way to wearie such fond thoughts:
This day they both a hunting forth will ride
Into these woods, adioyning to these walles,
When in the midst of all their gamesome sports,
Ile make the Clowdes dissolue their watrie workes,
And drench _Siluanus_ dwellings with their shewers,
Then in one Caue the Queene and he shall meete,
And interchangeably discourse their thoughts,
Whose short conclusion will seale vp their hearts,
Vnto the purpose which we now propound.

_Venus._ Sister, I see you sauour of my wiles,
Be it as you will haue for this once,
Meane time, _Ascanius_ shall be my charge,
Whom I will beare to _Ida_ in mine armes,
And couch him in _Adonis_ purple downe, _Exeunt._

_Enter Dido, Æneas, Anna, Iarbus, Achates, and followers._

_Dido._ _Æneas_, thinke not but I honor thee,
That thus in person goe with thee to hunt:
My princely robes thou seest are layd aside,
Whose glittering pompe _Dianas_ shrowdes supplies,
All fellowes now disposde alike to sporte,
The woods are wide, and we haue store of game:
Faire Troian, hold my golden bowe awhile,
Vntill I gird my quiuer to my side:
Lords goe before, we two must talke alone.

_Iar._ Vngentle, can she wrong _Iarbus_ so?
Ile dye before a stranger haue that grace:
We two will talke alone, what words be these?

_Dido._ What makes _Iarbus_ here of all the rest?
We could haue gone without your companie.

_Æn._ But loue and duetie led him on perhaps,
To presse beyond acceptance to your sight.

_Iar._ Why man of _Troy_, doe I offend thine eyes?
Or art thou grieude thy betters presse so nye?

_Dido._ How now Getulian, are ye growne so braue,
To challenge vs with your comparisons?
Pesant, goe seeke companions like thy selfe,
And meddle not with any that I loue:
_Æneas_, be not moude at what he sayes,
For otherwhile he will be out of ioynt.

_Iar._ Women may wrong by priuiledge of loue:
But should that man of men (_Dido_ except)
Haue taunted me in these opprobrious termes,
I would haue either drunke his dying bloud,
Or els I would haue giuen my life in gage?

_Dido._ Huntsmen, why pitch you not your toyles apace,
And rowse the light foote Deere from forth their laire.

_Anna._ Sister, see see _Ascanius_ in his pompe,
Bearing his huntspeare brauely in his hand.

_Dido._ Yea little sonne, are you so forward now?

_Asca._ I mother, I shall one day be a man,
And better able vnto other armes,
Meane time these wanton weapons serue my warre,
Which I will breake betwixt a Lyons iawes.

_Dido._ What, darest thou looke a Lyon in the face?

_Asca._ I, and outface him to, doe what he can.

_Anna._ How like his father speaketh he in all?

_Æn._ And mought I liue to see him sacke rich _Thebes_,
And loade his speare with Grecian Princes heads,
Then would I wish me with _Anchises_ Tombe,
And dead to honour that hath brought me vp.

_Iar._ And might I liue to see thee shipt away,
And hoyst aloft on _Neptunes_ hideous hilles,
Then would I wish me in faire _Didos_ armes,
And dead to scorne that hath pursued me so.

_Æn._ Stoute friend _Achates_, doest thou know this wood?

_Acha._ As I remember, here you shot the Deere,
That sau'd your famisht souldiers liues from death,
When first you set your foote vpon the shoare,
And here we met fair _Venus_ virgine like,
Bearing her bowe and quiuer at her backe.

_Æn._ O how these irksome labours now delight,
And ouerioy my thoughts with their escape:
Who would not vndergoe all kind of toyle,
To be well stor'd with such a winters tale?

_Dido._ _Æneas_, leaue these dumpes and lets away,
Some to the mountaines, some vnto the soyle,
You to the vallies, thou vnto the house.

_Exeunt omnes: manent._

_Iar._ I, this it is which wounds me to the death,
To see a Phrigian far fet to the sea,
Preferd before a man of maiestie:
O loue, O hate, O cruell womens hearts,
That imitate the Moone in euery chaunge,
And like the Planets euer loue to raunge:
What shall I doe thus wronged with disdaine?
Reuenge me on _Æneas_, or on her:
On her? fond man, that were to warre gainst heauen,
And with one shaft prouoke ten thousand darts:
This Troians end will be thy enuies aime,
Whose bloud will reconcile thee to content,
And make loue drunken with thy sweete desire:
But _Dido_ that now holdeth him so deare,
Will dye with very tidings of his death:
But time will discontinue her content,
And mould her minde vnto newe fancies shapes:
O God of heauen, turne the hand of fate
Vnto that happie day of my delight,
And then, what then? _Iarbus_ shall but loue:
So doth he now, though not with equall gaine,
That resteth in the riuall of thy paine,
Who nere will cease to soare till he be slaine. _Exit._

_The storme. Enter Æneas and Dido in the Caue at seuerall times._

_Dido._ _Æneas._

_Æn._ _Dido._

_Dido._ Tell me deare loue, how found you out this Caue?

_Æn._ By chance sweete Queene, as _Mars_ and _Venus_ met.

_Dido._ Why, that was in a net, where we are loose,
And yet I am not free, oh would I were.

_Æn._ Why, what is it that _Dido_ may desire
And not obtaine, be it in humaine power?

_Dido._ The thing that I will dye before I aske,
And yet desire to haue before I dye.

_Æn._ It is not ought _Æneas_ may achieue?

_Dido._ _Æneas_ no, although his eyes doe pearce.

_Æn._ What, hath _Iarbus_ angred her in ought?
And will she be auenged on his life?

_Dido._ Not angred me, except in angring thee.

_Æn._ Who then of all so cruell may he be,
That should detaine thy eye in his defects?

_Dido._ The man that I doe eye where ere I am,
Whose amorous face like _Pean_ sparkles fire,
When as he buts his beames on _Floras_ bed,
_Prometheus_ hath put on _Cupids_ shape,
And I must perish in his burning armes:
_Æneas_, O _Æneas_, quench these flames.

_Æn._ What ailes my Queene, is she falne sicke of late?

_Dido._ Not sicke my loue, but sicke, I must conceale
The torment, that it bootes me not reueale;
And yet Ile speake, and yet Ile hold my peace,
Doe shame her worst, I will disclose my griefe:
_Æneas_, thou art he, what did I say?
Something it was that now I haue forgot.

_Æn._ What meanes faire _Dido_ by this doubtfull speech?

_Dido._ Nay, nothing, but _Æneas_ loues me not.

_Æn._ _Æneas_ thoughts dare not ascend so high
As _Didos_ heart, which Monarkes might not scale.

_Dido._ It was because I sawe no King like thee,
Whose golden Crowne might ballance my content:
But now that I haue found what to effect,
I followe one that loueth fame for me,
And rather had seeme faire _Sirens_ eyes,
Then to the Carthage Queene that dyes for him.

_Æn._ If that your maiestie can looke so lowe,
As my despised worths, that shun all praise,
With this my hand I giue to you my heart,
And vow by all the Gods of Hospitalitie,
By heauen and earth, and my faire brothers bowe,
By _Paphos_, _Capys_, and the purple Sea,
From whence my radiant mother did descend,
And by this Sword that saued me from the Greekes,
Neuer to leaue these newe vpreared walles,
Whiles _Dido_ liues and rules in _Iunos_ towne,
Neuer to like or loue any but her.

_Dido._ What more then delian musicke doe I heare,
That calles my soule from forth his liuing seate,
To moue vnto the measures of delight:
Kind clowdes that sent forth such a curteous storme,
As made disdaine to flye to fancies lap:
Stoute loue in mine armes make thy _Italy_,
Whose Crowne and kingdome rests at thy commande.
_Sicheus_, not _Æneas_ be thou calde:
The King of _Carthage_, not _Anchises_ sonne:
Hold, take these Iewels at thy Louers hand,
These golden bracelets, and this wedding ring,
Wherewith my husband woo'd me yet a maide,
And be thou king of _Libia_, by my guift.

_Exeunt to the Caue._




Actus 4. Scena 1.


_Enter Achates, Ascanius, Iarbus, and Anna._

_Acha._ Did euer men see such a sudden storme?
Or day so cleere so suddenly orecast?

_Iar._ I thinke some fell Inchantresse dwelleth here,
That can call them forth when as she please,
And diue into blacke tempests treasurie,
When as she mcanes to maske the world with clowdes.

_Anna._ In all my life I neuer knew the like,
It haild, it snowde, it lightned all at once.

_Acha._ I thinke it was the diuels reuelling night,
There was such hurly burly in the heauens:
Doubtles _Apollos_ Axeltree is crackt,
Or aged _Atlas_ shoulder out of ioynt,
The motion was soouer violent.

_Iar._ In all this coyle, where haue ye left the Queene?

_Asca._ Nay, where is my warlike father, can you tell?

_Anna._ Behold where both of them come forth the Caue.

_Iar._ Come forth the Caue: can heauen endure this sight?
_Iarbus_, curse that vnreuenging _Ioue_,
Whose flintie darts slept in _Tiphous_ den,
Whiles these adulterers surfetted with sinne:
Nature, why mad'st me not some poysonous beast,
That with the sharpnes of my edged sting,
I might haue stakte them both vnto the earth,
Whil'st they were sporting in this darksome Caue?

_Æn._ The ayre is cleere, and Southerne windes are whist,
Come _Dido_, let vs hasten to the towne,
Since gloomie _Æolus_ doth cease to frowne.

_Dido._ _Achates_ and _Ascanius_, well met.

_Æn._ Faire _Anna_, how escapt you from the shower?

_Anna._ As others did, by running to the wood.

_Dido._ But where were you _Iarbus_ all this while?

_Iar._ Not with _Æneas_ in the vgly Caue.

_Dido._ I see _Æneas_ sticketh in your minde,
But I will soone put by that stumbling blocke,
And quell those hopes that thus employ your cares. _Exeunt._

_Enters Iarbus to Sacrifice._

_Iar._ Come seruants, come bring forth the Sacrifize,
That I may pacifie that gloomie _Ioue_,
Whose emptie Altars haue enlarg'd our illes.
Eternall _Ioue_, great master of the Clowdes,
Father of gladnesse, and all frollicke thoughts,
That with thy gloomie hand corrects the heauen,
When ayrie creatures warre amongst themselues:
Heare, heare, O heare _Iarbus_ plaining prayers,
Whose hideous ecchoes make the welkin howle,
And all the woods _Eliza_ to resound:
The woman that thou wild vs entertaine,
Where straying in our borders vp and downe,
She crau'd a hide of ground to build a towne,
With whom we did deuide both lawes and land,
And all the fruites that plentie els sends forth,
Scorning our loues and royall marriage rites,
Yeelds vp her beautie to a strangers bed,
Who hauing wrought her shame, is straight way fled:
Now if thou beest a pitying God of power,
On whom ruth and compassion euer waites,
Redresse these wrongs, and warne him to his ships,
That now afflicts me with his flattering eyes.

_Enter Anna._

_Anna._ How now _Iarbus_, at your prayers so hard?

_Iar._ I _Anna_, is there ought you would with me?

_Anna._ Nay, no such waightie busines of import,
But may be slackt vntill another time:
Yet if you would partake with me the cause
Of this deuotion that detaineth you,
I would be thankfull for such curtesie.

_Iar._ _Anna_, against this Troian doe I pray,
Who seekes to rob me of thy Sisters loue,
And dive into her heart by coloured lookes.

_Anna._ Alas poore King that labours so in vaine.
For her that so delighteth in thy paine:
Be rul'd by me, and seeke some other loue,
Whose yeelding heart may yeeld thee more reliefe.

_Iar._ Mine eye is fixt where fancie cannot start,
O leaue me, leaue me to my silent thoughts,
That register the numbers of my ruth,
And I will either moue the thoughtles flint,
Or drop out both mine eyes in drisling teares,
Before my sorrowes tide haue any stint.

_Anna._ I will not leaue _Iarbus_ whom I loue,
In this delight of dying pensiuenes:
Away with _Dido_, _Anna_ be thy song,
_Anna_ that doth admire thee more then heauen.

_Iar._ I may nor will list to such loathsome chaunge,
That intercepts the course of my desire:
Seruants, come fetch these emptie vessels here,
For I will flye from these alluring eyes,
That doe pursue my peace where ere it goes. _Exit._

_Anna._ _Iarbus_ stay, louing _Iarbus_ stay,
For I haue honey to present thee with:
Hard hearted, wilt not deigne to heare me speake,
Ile follow thee with outcryes nere the lesse,
And strewe thy walkes with my discheueld haire. _Exit._

_Enter Æneas alone._

_Æn._ _Carthage_, my friendly host adue,
Since destinie doth call me from the shoare:
_Hermes_ this night descending in a dreame,
Hath summond me to fruitfull _Italy_:
_Ioue_ wils it so, my mother wils it so:
Let my Phenissa graunt, and then I goe:
Graunt she or no, _Æneas_ must away,
Whose golden fortunes clogd with courtly ease,
Cannot ascend to Fames immortall house,
Or banquet in bright honors burnisht hall,
Till he hath furrowed _Neptunes_ glassie fieldes,
And cut a passage through his toples hilles:
_Achates_ come forth, _Sergestus_, _Illioneus_,
_Cloanthus_, haste away, _Æneas_ calles.

_Enter Achates, Cloanthus, Sergestus, and Illioneus._

_Acha._ What willes our Lord, or wherefore did he call?

_Æn._ The dreames (braue mates) that did beset my bed,
When sleepe but newly had imbrast the night,
Commaunds me leaue these vnrenowmed beames,
Whereas Nobilitie abhors to stay,
And none but base _Æneas_ will abide:
Abourd, abourd, since Fates doe bid abourd,
And slice the Sea with sable coloured ships,
On whom the nimble windes may all day waight,
And follow them as footemen through the deepe:
Yet _Dido_ casts her eyes like anchors out,
To stay my Fleete from loosing forth the Bay:
Come backe, come backe, I heare her crye a farre,
And let me linke my bodie to my lips,
That tyed together by the striuing tongues,
We may as one saile into _Italy_.

_Acha._ Banish that ticing dame from forth your mouth,
And follow your foreseeing starres in all;
This is no life for men at armes to liue,
Where daliance doth consume a Souldiers strength,
And wanton motions of alluring eyes,
Effeminate our mindes inur'd to warre.

_Illio._ Why, let vs build a Citie of our owne,
And not stand lingering here for amorous lookes:
Will _Dido_ raise old _Priam_ forth his graue,
And build the towne againe the Greekes did burne?
No no, she cares not how we sinke or swimme,
So she may haue _Æneas_ in her armes.

_Cloan._ To _Italy_, sweete friends to _Italy_,
We will not stay a minute longer here.

_Æn._ Troians abourd, and I will follow you,
I faine would goe, yet beautie calles me backe:
To leaue her so and not once say farewell,
Were to transgresse against all lawes of loue:
But if I vse such ceremonious thankes,
As parting friends accustome on the shoare,
Her siluer armes will coll me round about,
And teares of pearle, crye stay, _Æneas_, stay:
Each word she sayes will then containe a Crowne,
And euery speech be ended with a kisse:
I may not dure this female drudgerie,
To sea _Æneas_, finde out _Italy_.  _Exit._

_Enter Dido and Anna._

_Dido._ O _Anna_, runne vnto the water side,
They say _Æneas_ men are going abourd,
It may be he will steale away with them:
Stay not to answere me, runne _Anna_ runne.
O foolish Troians that would steale from hence,
And not let _Dido_ vnderstand their drift:
I would haue giuen _Achates_ store of gold,
And _Illioneus_ gum and Libian spice,
The common souldiers rich imbrodered coates,
And siluer whistles to controule the windes,
Which _Circes_ sent _Sicheus_ when he liued:
Vnworthie are they of a Queenes reward:
See where they come, how might I doe to chide?

_Enter Anna, with Æneas, Achates, Illioneus, and Sergestus._

_Anna._ Twas time to runne, _Æneas_ had been gone,
The sailes were hoysing vp, and he abourd.

_Dido._ Is this thy loue to me?

_Æn._ O princely _Dido_, giue me leaue to speake,
I went to take my farewell _Achates_.

_Dido._ How haps _Achates_ bid me not farewell?

_Acha._ Because I feard your grace would keepe me here.

_Dido._ To rid thee of that doubt, abourd againe,
I charge thee put to sea and stay not here.

_Acha._ Then let _Æneas_ goe abourd with vs.

_Dido._ Get you abourd, _Æneas_ meanes to stay.

_Æn._ The sea is rough, the windes blow to the shoare.

_Dido._ O false _Æneas_, now the sea is rough,
But when you were abourd twas calme enough,
Thou and _Achates_ ment to saile away.

_Æn._ Hath not the Carthage Queene mine onely sonne?
Thinkes _Dido_ I will goe and leaue him here?

_Dido._ _Æneas_ pardon me, for I forgot
That yong _Ascanius_ lay with me this night:
Loue made me iealous, but to make amends,
Weare the emperiall Crowne of _Libia_,
Sway thou the Punike Scepter in my steede,
And punish me _Æneas_ for this crime.

_Æn._ This kisse shall be faire _Didos_ punishment.

_Dido._ O how a Crowne becomes _Æneas_ head!
Stay here _Æneas_, and commaund as King.

_Æn._ How vaine am I to weare this Diadem,
And beare this golden Scepter in my hand?
A Burgonet of steele, and not a Crowne,
A Sword, and not a Scepter fits _Æneas_.

_Dido._ O keepe them still, and let me gaze my fill:
Now lookes _Æneas_ like immortall _Ioue_,
O where is _Ganimed_ to hold his cup,
And _Mercury_ to flye for what he calles,
Ten thousand _Cupids_ houer in the ayre,
And fanne it in _Æneas_ louely face,
O that the Clowdes were here wherein thou fleest,
That thou and I vnseene might sport our selues:
Heauens enuious of our ioyes is waxen pale,
And when we whisper, then the starres fall downe,
To be partakers of our honey talke.

_Æn._ O _Dido_, patronesse of all our liues,
When I leaue thee, death be my punishment,
Swell raging seas, frowne wayward destinies,
Blow windes, threaten ye Rockes and sandie shelfes,
This is the harbour that _Æneas_ seekes,
Lets see what tempests can anoy me now.

_Dido._ Not all the world can take thee from mine armes,
_Æneas_ may commaund as many Moores,
As in the Sea are little water drops:
And now to make experience of my loue,
Faire sister _Anna_ leade my louer forth,
And seated on my Gennet, let him ride
As _Didos_ husband through the punicke streetes,
And will my guard with Mauritanian darts,
To waite vpon him as their soueraigne Lord.

_Anna._ What if the Citizens repine thereat?

_Dido._ Those that dislike what _Dido_ giues in charge,
Commaund my guard to slay for their offence:
Shall vulgar pesants storme at what I doe?
The ground is mine that giues them sustenance,
The ayre wherein they breathe, the water, fire,
All that they haue, their lands, their goods, their liues,
And I the Goddesse of all these, commaund
_Æneas_ ride as Carthaginian King.

_Acha._ _Æneas_ for his parentage deserues
As large a kingdome as is _Libia_.

_Æn._ I, and vnlesse the destinies be false,
I shall be planted in as rich a land.

_Dido._ Speake of no other land, this land is thine,
_Dido_ is thine, henceforth Ile call thee Lord:
Doe as I bid thee, sister leade the way,
And from a turret Ile behold my loue.

_Æn._ Then here in me shall flourish _Priams_ race,
And thou and I _Achates_, for reuenge,
For _Troy_, for _Priam_, for his fiftie sonnes,
Our kinsmens loues, and thousand guiltles soules,
Will leade an hoste against the hatefull Greekes,
And fire proude _Lacedemon_ ore their heads. _Exit._

_Dido._ Speakes not _Æneas_ like a Conqueror?
O blessed tempests that did driue him in,
O happie sand that made him runne aground:
Henceforth you shall be our Carthage Gods:
I, but it may be he will leaue my loue,
And seeke a forraine land calde _Italy_:
O that I had a charme to keepe the windes
Within the closure of a golden ball,
Or that the Tyrrhen sea were in mine armes,
That he might suffer shipwracke on my breast,
As oft as he attempts to hoyst vp saile:
I must preuent him, wishing will not serue:
Goe, bid my Nurse take yong _Ascanius_,
And beare him in the countrey to her house,
_Æneas_ will not goe without his sonne:
Yet left he should, for I am full of feare,
Bring me his oares, his tackling, and his sailes;
What if I sinke his ships? O heele frowne.
Better he frowne, then I should dye for griefe:
I cannot see him frowne, it may not be:
Armies of foes resolu'd to winne this towne,
Or impious traitors vowde to haue my life,
Affright me not, onely _Æneas_ frowne
Is that which terrifies poore _Didos_ heart:
Nor bloudie speares appearing in the ayre,
Presage the downfall of my Emperie,
Nor blazing Commets threatens _Didos_ death,
It is _Æneas_ frowne that ends my daies:
If he forsake me not, I neuer dye,
For in his lookes I see eternitie,
And heele make me immortall with a kisse.

_Enter a Lord._

Your Nurse is gone with yong _Ascanius_,
And heres _Æneas_ tackling, oares and sailes.

_Dido._ Are these the sailes that in despight of me,
Packt with the windes to beare _Æneas_ hence?
Ile hang ye in the chamber where I lye,
Driue if you can my house to _Italy_:
Ile set the casement open that the windes
May enter in, and once againe conspire
Against the life of me poore Carthage Queene:
But though he goe, he stayes in Carthage still,
And let rich Carthage fleete vpon the seas,
So I may haue _Æneas_ in mine armes.
Is this the wood that grew in Carthage plaines,
And would be toyling in the watrie billowes,
To rob their mistresse of her Troian guest?
O cursed tree, hadst thou but wit or sense,
To measure how I prize _Æneas_ loue,
Thou wouldst haue leapt from out the Sailers hands,
And told me that _Æneas_ ment to goe:
And yet I blame thee not, thou art but wood.
The water which our Poets terme a Nimph,
Why did it suffer thee to touch her breast,
And shrunke not backe, knowing my loue was there?
The water is an Element, no Nimph,
Why should I blame _Æneas_ for his flight?
O _Dido_, blame not him, but breake his oares,
These were the instruments that launcht him forth,
Theres not so much as this base tackling too,
But dares to heape vp sorrowe to my heart:
Was it not you that hoysed vp these sailes?
Why burst you not, and they fell in the seas?
For this will _Dido_ tye ye full of knots,
And sheere ye all asunder with her hands:
Now serue to chastize shipboyes for their faults,
Ye shall no more offend the Carthage Queene,
Now let him hang my fauours on his masts,
And see if those will serue in steed of sailes:
For tackling, let him take the chaines of gold,
Which I bestowd vpon his followers:
In steed of oares, let him vse his hands,
And swim to _Italy_, Ile keepe these sure:
Come beare them in. _Exit._

_Enter the Nurse with Cupid for Ascanius._

_Nurse._ My Lord _Ascanius_, ye must goe with me.

_Cupid._ Whither must I goe? Ile stay with my mother.

_Nurse._ No, thou shalt goe with me vnto my house,
I haue an Orchard that hath store of plums,
Browne Almonds, Seruises, ripe Figs and Dates,
Dewberries, Apples, yellow Orenges,
A garden where are Bee hiues full of honey,
Musk-roses, and a thousand sort of flowers,
And in the midst doth run a siluer streame,
Where thou shalt see the red gild fishes leape,
White Swannes, and many louely water fowles:
Now speake _Ascanius_, will ye goe or no?

_Cupid._ Come come Ile goe, how farre hence is your house?

_Nurse._ But hereby child, we shall get thither straight.

_Cupid._ Nurse I am wearie, will you carrie me?

_Nurse._ I, so youle dwell with me and call me mother.

_Cupid._ So youle loue me, I care not if I doe.

_Nurse._ That I might liue to see this boy a man,
How pretilie he laughs, goe ye wagge,
Youle be a twigger when you come to age.
Say _Dido_ what she will I am not old,
Ile be no more a widowe, I am young,
Ile haue a husband, or els a louer.

_Cupid._ A husband and no teeth!

_Nurse._ O what meane I to haue such foolish thoughts!
Foolish is loue, a toy, O sacred loue,
If there be any heauen in earth, tis loue:
Especially in women of your yeares.
Blush blush for shame, why shouldst thou thinke of loue?
A graue, and not a louer fits thy age:
A graue, why? I may liue a hundred yeares,
Fourescore is but a girles age, loue is sweete:
My vaines are withered, and my sinewes drie,
Why doe I thinke of loue now I should dye?

_Cupid._ Come Nurse.

_Nurse._ Well, if he come a wooing he shall speede,
O how vnwise was I to say him nay!  _Exeunt._




Actus 5.


_Enter Æneas with a paper in his hand, drawing the platforme of the
citie, with him Achates, Cloanthus, and Illieneus._

_Æn._ Triumph my mates, our trauels are at end,
Here will _Æneas_ build a statelier _Troy_,
Then that which grim _Atrides_ ouerthrew:
_Carthage_ shall vaunt her pettie walles no more,
For I will grace them with a fairer frame,
And clad her in a Chrystall liuerie,
Wherein the day may euermore delight:
From golden _India Ganges_ will I fetch,
Whose wealthie streames may waite vpon her towers,
And triple wise intrench her round about:
The Sunne from Egypt shall rich odors bring,
Wherewith his burning beames like labouring Bees,
That loade their thighes with _Hyblas_ honeys spoyles,
Shall here vnburden their exhaled sweetes,
And plant our pleasant suburbes with her fumes.

_Acha._ What length or bredth shal this braue towne cōtaine?

_Æn._ Not past foure thousand paces at the most.

_Illio._ But what shall it be calde, _Troy_ as before?

_Æn._ That haue I not determinde with my selfe.

_Cloan._ Let it be term'd _Ænea_ by your name.

_Serg._ Rather _Ascania_ by your little sonne.

_Æn._ Nay, I will haue it calde _Anchisaon_,
Of my old fathers name.

_Enter Hermes with Ascanius._

_Hermes._ _Æneas_ stay, _Ioues_ Herald bids thee stay.

_Æn._ Whom doe I see, _Ioues_ winged messenger?
Welcome to _Carthage_ new erected towne.

_Hermes._ Why cosin, stand you building Cities here,
And beautifying the Empire of this Queene,
While _Italy_ is cleane out of thy minde?
To too forgetfull of thine owne affayres,
Why wilt thou so betray thy sonnes good hap?
The king of Gods sent me from highest heauen,
To sound this angrie message in thine eares.
Vaine man, what Monarky expectst thou here?
Or with what thought sleepst thou in _Libia_ shoare?
If that all glorie hath forsaken thee,
And thou despise the praise of such attempts:
Yet thinke vpon _Ascanius_ prophesie,
And yong _Iulus_ more then thousand yeares,
Whom I haue brought from _Ida_ where he slept,
And bore yong _Cupid_ vnto _Cypresse_ Ile.

_Æn._ This was my mother that beguild the Queene,
And made me take my brother for my sonne:
No maruell _Dido_ though thou be in loue,
That daylie danlest _Cupid_ in thy armes:
Welcome sweet child, where hast thou been this long?

_Asca._ Eating sweet Comfites with Queene _Didos_ maide,
Who euer since hath luld me in her armes.

_Æn._ _Sergestus_, beare him hence vnto our ships,
Lest _Dido_ spying him keepe him for a pledge.

_Hermes._ Spendst thou thy time about this little boy,
And giuest not care vnto the charge I bring?
I tell thee thou must straight to _Italy_,
Or els abide the wrath of frowning _Ioue_.

_Æn._ How should I put into the raging deepe,
Who haue no sailes nor tackling for my ships?
What would the Gods haue me _Deucalion_ like,
Flote vp and downe where ere the billowes driue?
Though she repairde my fleete and gaue me ships,
Yet hath she tane away my oares and masts,
And left me neither saile nor sterne abourd.

_Enter to them Iarbus._

_Iar._ How now _Æneas_, sad, what meanes these dumpes?

_Æn._ _Iarbus_, I am cleane besides my selfe,
_Ioue_ hath heapt on me such a desperate charge,
Which neither art nor reason may atchieue,
Nor I deuise by what meanes to contriue.

_Iar._ As how I pray, may I entreat you tell.

_Æn._ With speede he bids me sail to _Italy_.
When as I want both rigging for my fleete,
And also furniture for these my men.

_Iar._ If that be all, then cheare thy drooping lookes,
For I will furnish thee with such supplies:
Let some of those thy followers goe with me,
And they shall haue what thing so ere thou needst.

_Æn._ Thankes good _Iarbus_ for thy friendly ayde,
_Achates_ and the rest shall waite on thee,
Whil'st I rest thankfull for this curtesie.

_Exit Iarbus and Æneas traine._

Now will I haste vnto _Lauinian_ shoare,
And raise a new foundation to old _Troy_,
Witnes the Gods, and witnes heauen and earth,
How loth I am to leaue these _Libian_ bounds,
But that eternall _Iupiter_ commands.

_Enter Dido and Æneas._

_Dido._ I feare I sawe _Æneas_ little sonne,
Led by _Achates_ to the Troian fleete:
If it be so, his father meanes to flye:
But here he is, now _Dido_ trie thy wit.
_Æneas_, wherefore goe thy men abourd?,
Why are thy ships new rigd? or to what end
Launcht from the hauen, lye they in the Rhode?
Pardon me though I aske, loue makes me aske.

_Æn._ O pardon me, if I resolue thee why:
_Æneas_ will not faine with his deare loue,
I must from hence: this day swift _Mercury_
When I was laying a platforme for these walles,
Sent from his father _Ioue_, appeard to me,
And in his name rebukt me bitterly,
For lingering here, neglecting _Italy_.

_Dido._ But yet _Æneas_ will not leaue his loue.

_Æn._ I am commaunded by immortal _Ioue_,
To leaue this towne and passe to _Italy_,
And therefore must of force.

_Dido._ These words proceed not from _Æneas_ heart.

_Æn._ Not from my heart, for I can hardly goe,
And yet I may not stay, _Dido_ farewell.

_Dido._ Farewell: is this the mends for _Didos_ loue?
Doe Troians vse to quit their Louers thus?
Fare well may _Dido_, so _Æneas_ stay,
I dye, if my _Æneas_ say farewell.

_Æn._ Then let me goe and neuer say farewell,
Let me goe, farewell, I must from hence.

_Dido._ These words are poyson to poore _Didos_ soule,
O speake like my _Æneas_, like my loue:
Why look'st thou toward the sea? the time hath been
When _Didos_ beautie chaungd thine eyes to her;
Am I lesse faire then when thou sawest me first?
O then _Æneas_, tis for griefe of thee:
Say thou wilt stay in _Carthage_ with my Queene,
And _Didos_ beautie will returne againe:
_Æneas_, say, how canst thou take thy leaue?
Wilt thou kisse _Dido_? O thy lips haue sworne
To stay with _Dido_: canst thou take her hand?
Thy Hand and mine haue plighted mutuall faith,
Therefore vnkinde _Æneas_, must thou say,
Then let me goe, and neuer say farewell.

_Æn._ O Queene of _Carthage_, wert thou vgly blacke,
_Æneas_ could not choose but hold thee deare,
Yet must he not gainsay the Gods behest.

_Dido._ The Gods, what Gods be those that seeke my death?
Wherein haue I offended _Iupiter_,
That he should take _Æneas_ from mine armes?
O no, the Gods wey not what Louers doe,
It is _Æneas_ calles _Æneas_ hence,
And wofull _Dido_ by these blubbred cheekes,
By this right hand, and by our spousall rites,
Desires _Æneas_ to remaine with her:
_Si bene quid de te merui, fuit aut tibi quidquam
Dulce meum, miserere domus labentis: & istam
Oro, si quis ad hac precibus locus, exue mentem._

_Æn. Desine meque tuis incendere teque querelis,
Italiam non sponte sequor._

_Dido._ Hast thou forgot how many neighbour kings
Were vp in armes, for making thee my loue?
How _Carthage_ did rebell, _Iarbus_ storme,
And all the world calles me a second _Helen_,
For being intangled by a strangers lookes:
So thou wouldst proue as true as _Paris_ did,
Would, as faire _Troy_ was, _Carthage_ might be sackt,
And I be calde a second _Helena_.
Had I a sonne by thee, the griefe were lesse,
That I might see _Æneas_ in his face:
Now if thou goest, what canst thou leaue behind,
But rather will augment then ease my woe?

_Æn._ In vaine my loue thou spendst thy fainting breath,
If words might moue me I were ouercome.

_Dido._ And wilt thou not be mou'd with _Didos_ words?
Thy mother was no Goddesse periurd man,
Nor _Dardanus_ the author of thy stocke:
But thou art Sprung from _Scythian Caucasus_,
And Tygers of _Hircania_ gaue thee sucke:
Ah foolish _Dido_ to forbeare this long!
Wast thou not wrackt vpon this _Libian_ shoare,
And cam'st to _Dido_ like a Fisherswaine?
Repairde not I thy ships, made thee a King,
And all thy needie followers Noblemen?
O Serpent that came creeping from the shoare,
And I for pitie harbord in my bosome,
Wilt thou now slay me with thy venomed sting,
And hisse at _Dido_ for preseruing thee?
Goe goe and spare not, seeke out _Italy_,
I hope that that which loue forbids me doe,
The Rockes and Sea-gulfes will performe at large,
And thou shalt perish in the billowes waies,
To whom poore _Dido_ doth bequeath reuenge,
I traytor, and the waues shall cast thee vp,
Where thou and false _Achates_ first set foote:
Which if it chaunce, Ile giue ye buriall,
And weepe vpon your liueles carcases,
Though thou nor he will pitie me a whit.
Why star'st thou in my face? if thou wilt stay,
Leape in mine armes, mine armes are open wide:
If not, turne from me, and Ile turne from thee;
For though thou hast the heart to say farewell,
I haue not power to stay thee: is he gone?
I but heele come againe, he cannot goe,
He loues me to too well to serue me so:
Yet he that in my sight would not relent,
Will, being absent, be abdurate still.
By this is he got to the water side,
And, see the Sailers take him by the hand,
But he shrinkes backe, and now remembring me,
Returnes amaine: welcome, welcome my loue:
But wheres _Æneas_? ah hees gone hees gone!

_Anna._ What meanes my sister thus to raue and crye?

_Dido._ O _Anna_, my _Æneas_ is abourd,
And leauing me will saile to _Italy_.
Once didst thou goe, and he came backe againe,
Now bring him backe, and thou shalt be a Queene,
And I will liue a priuate life with him.

_Anna._ Wicked _Æneas_.

_Dido._ Call him not wicked, sister speake him faire,
And looke vpon him with a Mermaides eye,
Tell him, I neuer vow'd at _Aulis_ gulfe
The desolation of his natiue _Troy_,
Nor sent a thousand ships vnto the walles,
Nor euer violated faith to him:
Request him gently (_Anna_) to returne,
I craue but this, he stay a tide or two,
That I may learne to beare it patiently,
If he depart thus suddenly, I dye:
Run _Anna_, run, stay not to answere me.

_Anna._ I goe faire sister, heauens graunt good successe.

_Exit Anna._

_Enter the Nurse._

_Nurse._ O _Dido_, your little sonne _Ascanius_
Is gone! he lay with me last night,
And in the morning he was stolne from me,
I thinke some Fairies haue beguiled me.

_Dido._ O cursed hagge and false dissembling wretch!
That slayest me with thy harsh and hellish tale,
Thou for some pettie guift hast let him goe,
And I am thus deluded of my boy:
Away with her to prison presently,
Traytoresse too keend and cursed Sorceresse.

_Nurse._ I know not what you meane by treason, I,
I am as true as any one of yours. _Exeunt the Nurse._

_Dido._ Away with her, suffer her not to speake.
My sister comes, I like not her sad lookes.

_Enter Anna._

_Anna._ Before I came, _Æneas_ was abourd,
And spying me, hoyst vp the sailes amaine:
But I cride out, _Æneas_, false _Æneas_ stay.
Then gan he wagge his hand, which yet held vp,
Made me suppose he would haue heard me speake:
Then gan they driue into the Ocean,
Which when I viewd, I cride, _Æneas_ stay,
_Dido_, faire _Dido_ wils _Æneas_ stay:
Yet he whose heart of adamant or flint,
My teares nor plaints could mollifie a whit:
Then carelesly I rent my haire for griefe,
Which seene to all, though he beheld me not,
They gan to moue him to redresse my ruth,
And stay a while to heare what I could say,
But he clapt vnder hatches saild away.

_Dido._ O _Anna_, _Anna_, I will follow him.

_Anna._ How can ye goe when he hath all your fleete?

_Dido._ Ile frame me wings of waxe like _Icarus_,
And ore his ships will soare vnto the Sunne,
That they may melt and I fall in his armes:
Or els Ile make a prayer vnto the waues,
That I may swim to him like _Tritons_ neece:
O _Anna_, fetch _Orions_ Harpe,
That I may tice a Dolphin to the shoare,
And ride vpon his backe vnto my loue:
Looke sister, looke louely _Æneas_ ships,
See see, the billowes heaue him vp to heauen,
And now downe falles the keeles into the deepe:
O sister, sister, take away the Rockes,
Theile breake his ships, O _Proteus_, _Neptune_, _Ioue_,
Saue, saue _Æneas_, _Didos_ leefest loue!
Now is he come on shoare safe without hurt:
But see, _Achates_ wils him put to sea,
And all the Sailers merrie make for ioy,
But he remembring me shrinkes backe againe:
See where he comes, welcome, welcome my loue.

_Anna._ Ah sister, leaue these idle fantasies,
Sweet sister cease, remember who you are.

_Dido. Dido_ I am, vnlesse I be deceiu'd,
And must I raue thus for a renegate?
Must I make ships for him to saile away?
Nothing can beare me to him but a ship,
And he hath all thy fleete, what shall I doe?
But dye in furie of this ouersight?
I, I must be the murderer of my selfe:
No but I am not, yet I will be straight.
_Anna_ be glad, now haue I found a meane
To rid me from these thoughts of Lunacie:
Not farre from hence there is a woman famoused for arts,
Daughter vnto the Nimphs _Hesperides_,
Who wild me sacrifice his ticing relliques:
Goe _Anna_, bid my seruants bring me fire.  _Exit Anna._

_Enter Iarbus._

_Iar._ How long will _Dido_ mourne a strangers flight,
That hath dishonord her and _Carthage_ both?
How long shall I with griefe consume my daies,
And reape no guerdon for my truest loue?

_Dido._ _Iarbus_, talk not of _Æneas_, let him goe,
Lay to thy hands and helpe me make a fire,
That shall consume all that this stranger left,
For I entend a priuate Sacrifize,
To cure my minde that melts for vnkind loue.

_Iar._ But afterwards will _Dido_ graunt me loue?

_Dido._ I, I, _Iarbus_, after this is done,
None in the world shall have my loue but thou:
So, leaue me now, let none approach this place. _Exit Iarbus._
Now _Dido_, with these reliques burne thy selfe,
And make _Æneas_ famous through the world,
For periurie and slaughter of a Queene:
Here lye the Sword that in the darksome Caue
He drew, and swore by to be true to me,
Thou shalt burne first, thy crime is worse then his:
Here lye the garment which I cloath'd him in,
When first he came on shoare, perish thou to:
These letters, lines, and periurd papers all,
Shall burne to cinders in this prectious flame.
And now ye Gods that guide the starrie frame,
And order all things at your high dispose;
Graunt, though the traytors land in _Italy_,
They may be still tormented with vnrest,
And from mine ashes let a Conquerour rise,
That may reuenge this treason to a Queene,
By plowing vp his Countries with the Sword:
Betwixt this land and that be neuer league,
_Littora littoribus contraria, fluctibus undas
Impresor: arma armis: pugnent ipsig nepotes_:
Liue false _Æneas_, truest _Dido_ dyes,
_Sic sic inuat ire sub umbras_.

_Enter Anna._

_Anna._ O helpe _Iarbus_, _Dido_ in these flames
Hath burnt her selfe, aye me, vnhappie me!

_Enter Iarbus running._

_Iar._ Cursed _Iarbus_, dye to expiate
The griefe that tires vpon thine inward soule,
_Dido_ I come to thee, aye me _Æneas_.

_Anna._ What can my teares or cryes preuaile me now?
_Dido_ is dead, _Iarbus_ slaine, _Iarbus_ my deare loue,
O sweet _Iarbus_, _Annas_ sole delight,
What fatall destinie enuies me thus,
To see my sweet _Iarbus_ slay himselfe?
But _Anna_ now shall honor thee in death,
And mixe her bloud with thine, this shall I doe,
That Gods and men may pitie this my death,
And rue our ends senceles of life or breath;
Now sweet _Iarbus_ stay, I come to thee.

_FINIS._
