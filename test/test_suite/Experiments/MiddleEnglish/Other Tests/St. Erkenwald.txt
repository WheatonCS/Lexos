At London in Englonde noʒt fulle longe syþen 
syþen kryst suffred on crosse and Cristendome stabled,
Ther was a byschop in þat burghe, blessyd and sakred;
Saynt Ernenwolde as I hope þat holy mon hatte.
In his tyme in þat toun þe temple alþer grattest
Was drawen doun, þat one dole, to dedifie nwe,
For hit hethen had bene in Hengyst dawes
þat þe Saxones vnsaʒt haden sende hyder.
þai bete out þe Bretons and broʒt hom into waleʒ
And pervertyd alle þe peple þat in þat place dwellide.
þen wos this reme renayed mony ronk ʒeres,
Til Saynt Austyn into Sandewiche as send fro þe pope.
þen prechyd he here þe pure faythe and planted þe trawthe,
And convertyd all þe communnates to Cristendame newe.
He turned temples þat tyme þat temyd to þe develle,
And Clansyd hom in Cristes nome and kyrkes hom called;
He hurled out hor ydols and hade hym in saynteʒ, 
And chaunged chevely hor nameʒ and chaunged hom better;
þat er was of Appolyn is now Saynt Peter,
Mahoun to Saynt Margrete oþer to Maudelayne,
þe Synagoge of þe sunne was sett to oure Lady,
Jubiter and Jono to Jesu oþer to James.
So he hom dedifiet and dyʒt all to dere haloweʒ
þat er wos sett of satanas in Saxones tyme.
	Now þat London is nevenyd hatte þe nwe troye,
þe metropol and þe mayster toun hit euer more has bene.
þe mukel mynster þerinne a maʒty devel aʒt,
And þe tytle of þe temple bitan was his name,
For he was dryʒten derrest of ydols praysed
And þe solempnest of his sacrifices in Saxon londes. 
þe thrid temple hit wos tolde of Triapolitanes:
By alle Bretaynes bonkeʒ were bot othire tweyne.
Now of þis Augustynes art is Erkenwolde bischop
At luf London toun and the lawe techeʒ,
Syttes semly in þe sege of Saynt poule mynster
þat was þe temple Triapolitan as I tolde are.
þen was hit abated and beten doun and buggyed efte nwe,
A noble note for þe noneʒ and nwe Werke hit hatte.
Mony a myry mason was made þer to wyrke,
Harde stones for to hewe with eggit toles,
Mony grubber in grete þe grounde for to seche
þat þe fundament on fyrst shuld þe fote halde;
And as þai makkyde and mynyde a meruayle þai founden
As ʒet in crafty cronecles is kydde þe memorie,
For as þai dyʒt and dalfe so depe into þe erthe
þai founden formed on  flore a ferly fayre toumbe;
Hit was a throghe of thykke ston þryuandely hewen,
With gargeles garnyst aboute alle of gray marbre.
The sperle of þe spelunke þat spradde hit alofte
Was metely made of þe marbre and menskefully planed
And þe bordure enbelicit with bryʒt golde lettres;
Bot runisch were þe resones þat þer on rowe standen.
Full verray were þe figures, þer avisyd hom mony,
Bot all mused hit to mouth and quat hit mene shulde;
Mony clerke in þat clos with crownes ful brode
þer bisied hom aboute noʒt to bryng hom in wordes.
Quen tyþyngeʒ token to þe toun of þe toumbe wonder
Mony hundreth hende men hyʒed þider sone;
Burgeys bowed þerto, bedels and othire,
And mony a mesters mon of manners dyverse;
Laddes laften hor werke and lopen þiderwardes,
runnen radly in route with ryngande noyse;
þer commen pider of all kynnes so kenely mony
þat as alle þe worlde were þider walon within a hondewhyle.
Quen þe maire with his meyny þat meruayle asspyed,
By asent of þe sextene þe sayntuaré þai keped,
Bede vnlouke þe lidde and lay hit byside;
þai wolde loke on þat lome quat lenged withinne.
Wyʒt werkemen with þat wenten þer tylle,
Putten prises þerto, pinchid anvnder,
kaʒten by þe corners with crowes of yrne,
And were þe lydde neuer so large þai layde hit by sone.
But þen wos wonder to wale on wyʒeʒ þat standen
That myʒt not com to to knowe a koyntyse strange
So was þe glode within gay, al with golde paynted,
And a blyssfull body opon þe bothem lyggid,
arayed on a ryche wyse in ryal wedes.
Al with glysnande golde his goune wos hemmyd,
With mony a precious perle pyʒt þeron,
And a gordel of golde bigripid his mydelle;
A much mantyle on lofte with menyver furred,
þe clothe of camelyn ful clene with cumly bordures;
And on his coyfe wos kest a coron ful ryche
And a semly septure sett in his honde.
Als wemleʒ were his wedes withouten any teche
oþer of moulynge oþer of motes oþer moght freten,
And als bryʒt of hor ble in blysnande hewes
As þai hade ʒeply in þat ʒorde bene ʒisterday schapen;
And als freshe hym þe face and the flesch naked
Bi his eres and bi his hondes þat openly schewed
With ronk rode as þe rose and two rede lyppeʒ,
As he in sounde sodanly were slypped opon slepe.
þer was spedeles space to spyr vschon oþer
Quat body hit myʒt be þat buried wos ther,
How longe had he þer layne, his lere so vnchaungit,
And al his wede vnwemmyd? þus ilke wyʒe askyd.
'Hit myʒt not be bot suche a mon in myde stod longe.
He has ben kyng of þis kyth, as couthely hit semeʒ,
He lyes dolven þus depe; hit is a derfe wonder
Bot summe segge couthe say þat he hym sene hade.'
Bot þat ilke note wos noght, for norne none couthe,
nawþer by tytle ne token ne by tale nawþer,
þat euer wos breued in burgh ne in boke noted
þat euer mynned suche a mon, more ne lasse.
	þe bodeworde to þe byschop was broʒt on a quyle
Of þat buriede body al þe bolde wonder.
þe prymate with his prelacie was parted fro home,
In Esex was Sir Erkenwolde an abbay to visite.
Tulkes tolden hym þe tale with troubulle in þe peple
And suche a cry aboute a cors crakit euer more;
The bischop sende hit to blynne by bedels and lettres
And busked þiderwarde bytyme on his blonk after.
By þat he com to þe kyrke kydde of Saynt poule,
Mony hym metten on þat meere þe meruayle to telle;
He passed into his palays and pes he comaunded
And devoydit fro þe dede and dit þe dor after.
þe derke nyʒt overdrofe and day belle ronge,
And Sir Erkenwolde was vp in þe vʒten er þen,
þat welneghe al þe nyʒt hade nayted his houreʒ
To biseche his souerayn of his swete grace
To vouchesafe to revele hym hit by a vysyoun or elles.
'þagh I be vnworthi,' al wepande he sayde,
'Thurghe his deere debonerte digne hit my Lorde:
In confirmynge þi krysten fayth, fulsun me to kenne
þe mystery of þis meruayle þat men opon wondres.'
And so longe he gret after grace þat he graunte hade,
An ansuare of þe Holy Goste, and afterwarde hit dawid.
Mynster dores were made vpon quen matynnes were songen;
þe byschop hym schop solemply to synge þe hyʒe masse.
þe prelate in pontificals was prestly atyride,
Manerly with his ministres þe masse he begynnes
Of Spiritus Domini for his spede on sotyle wyse,
With queme questis of þe quere with ful quaynt notes.
Mony a gay grete lorde was gedered to herken hit,
As þe rekenest of þe reme repayre þider ofte,
Tille sesed was þe service and sayde þe later ende;
þen heldet fro þe autere all þe hyʒe gynge.
	þe prelate passed on þe playn, þer plyed to hym lordes,
As ryche revestid as he was he rayked to þe toumbe;
Men vnclosed hym þe cloyster with clustered keyes,
Bot pyne wos with þe grete prece þat passed hym after.
The byschop com to þe burynes, him barones besyde,
þe maire with mony maʒty men and macers bifore hym.
þe dene of þe dere place deuised al on fyrst,
þe fyndyng of þat ferly with fynger he mynte.
'Lo, lordes,' quod þat lede, 'suche a lyche here is
Has layne loken here on loghe, how longe is vnknawen;
and ʒet his colout and his clothe has caʒt no defaute,
Ne his lyre ne þe lome þat he is layde inne.
þer is no lede opon lyf of so longe age
þat may mene in his mynde þat suche a mon regnyd,
Ne nawþer his nome ne his note norne of one speche;
wheþer mony porer in þis place is put into grave
þat merked is in oure martilage his mynde for euer;
And we have oure librarie layted þed longe seuen dayes,
Bot one cronicle of þis kyng con we neuer fynde.
He has non layne here so longe, to loke hit by kynde,
To malte so out of memorie bot meruayle hit were.'
'þou says soþe,' quod þe segge þat sakred was byschop,
'Hit is meruayle to men, þat mountes to litelle
Towarde þe providens of þe prynce þat paradis weldes,
Quen hym lyst to vnlouke þe lest of his myʒtes.
Bot quen matyd is monnes myʒt and his mynde passed,
And al his resons are torent and redles he stondes,
þen lettes hit hym ful litelle to louse wyt a fynger
þat all þe hondes vnder heuen halde myʒt neuer.
þere as creatures crafte of counselle out swarves,
þe comfort of þe creator byhoves þe cure take.
And so do we now oure dede, deuine we no fyrre;
To seche þe soth at oureselfe ʒee se þer no bote;
Bot glow we alle opon Godde and his grace aske,
þat careles is of counselle and comfort to sende,
And þat in fastynge of ʒour fayth and of fyne bileve.
I shal avay ʒow so verayly of vertues his
þat ʒe may leue vpon longe þat he is lorde maʒty
And fayn ʒour talent to fulfylle if ʒe hym frende leueʒ.'
	Then he turnes to þe toumbe and talkeʒ to þe corse,
Lyftande vp his yʒe lyddeʒ he loused suche wordes:
'Now, lykhame þat þou lies, layne þou no lenger!
syþen  Jesus has iugged today his ioy to be schewyde,
Be þou boun to his bode, I bydde in his behalve;
As he was bende on a bem quen he his blod schede,
As þou hit wost wyterly and we hit wele leuen,
Ansuare here to my sawe, councele no trawthe!
syþen we wot not quo þou art, witere vs þiselwen
In worlde quat wyʒe þou was and quy þow þus lyggeʒ,
How longe þou has layne here and quat lawe þou vsed,
wheþer art þou ioyned to ioy oþer iugged to pyne.'
Quen þe segge hade þus sayde and syked þerafter,
þe bryʒt body in þe buryes brayed a litelle,
And with a drwry dreme be dryves owte wordes
þurgh sum lent goste lyf of hym þat al redes.
'Bisshop,' quod þis ilke body, 'þi bode is me dere;
I may not bot boghe to þi bone for bothe myn yʒen.
þe name þat þou nevenyd has and nurned me after
Al heuen and helle heldeʒ to and erthe bitwene.
fyrst to say the þe sothe quo myselfe were:
One þe vnhapnest hathel þat euer on erth ʒod,
neuer kyng ne cayser ne ʒet no knyʒt nawþer,
Bot a lede of þe lawe þat þen þis londe vsed.
I was committid and made a mayster mon here
To sytte vpon sayd causeʒ; þis cité I ʒemed
vnder a prynce of parage of paynymes lawe,
And uche segge þat him sued þe same fayth trawed.
þe lenþe of my lyinge here þat is a lewed date,
Hit to much to any mon to make of a noumbre.
After þat Brutus þis burghe had buggid on fyrste,
Noʒt bot fife hundreth ʒere þer aghtene wonted
bifore þat kynned ʒour kryst by krysten acounte:
A þousand ʒere and þretty mo and ʒet threnen aʒt. 
I was an heire of an oye in þe nwe troye
In þe regne of þe ryche kyng þat rewled vs þen,
The bolde Breton Sir Belyn   Sir Berynge was his brothire;
Mony one was þe busmar boden hom bitwene
For hor wrakful werre quyl hor wrath lastyd.
þen was I iugge here enioynyd in gentyl lawe.'
	quyl he in spelunke þus speke, þer sprang in þe peple
In al þis worlde no worde ne wakned no noyse,
Bot al as stylle as þe ston standen and lystened
With much wonder forwrast, and weped ful mony.
The bisshop biddes þat body: 'Biknowe þe cause,
syþen þou was kidde for no kyng, quy þou þe croun wereʒ.
Quy haldes þou so hyʒe in honde þe septre
And hades no londe of lege men ne lyf ne lym aʒt?'
'Dere sir,' quod þe dede body, 'debyse þe I thenke,
Al was hit neuer my wylle þat wroʒt þus hit were. 
I was deputate and domesmon vnder a duk noble,
And in my power þis place was put altogeder
I justyfyet þis joly toun on gentyl wyse
And euer in fourme of gode faythe, more þen forty wynter.
þe folk was felonse and fals and frowarde to rule  
I hent harmeʒ ful ofte to holde hom to ryʒt;
Bot for wothe ne wele, ne wrath ne drede,
Ne for maystery ne for mede, ne for no monnes aghe,
I remewit neuer fro þe ryʒt by resoun myn awen
For to dresse a wrange dome, no day of my lyf,
Declynet neuer my consciens for covetyse on erthe
In no gynful iuggement no iapeʒ to make,
Were a renk neuer so ryche, for reuerens sake;
Ne for no monnes manace, ne meschef ne rauthe,
Non gete me fro þe hyʒe gate to glent out of ryʒt
Als ferforthe as my fayth confourmyd my hert. 
þaghe had bene my fader bone, I bede hym no wranges,
Ne fals fauour to my fader, þaghe fell hym be hongyt.
And for I was rytʒwys and reken and redy of þe lawe,
Quen I dyed for dole denyed all Troye;
Alle menyd my dethe, þe more and the lasse,
And þus to bounte my body þai buriet in golde,
Cladden me for þe curtest þat courte couthe þen holde,
In mantyle for þe mekest and monlokest on bench,
gurde me for þe gouernour and graythist of troye,
furred me for þe fynest of fayth me wtinne.
For þe honour of myn honeste of heghest enpryse
þai coronyd me þe kidde kyng of kene justises
þer euer wos tronyd in Troye oþer trawed euer shulde,
And for I rewardid euer ryʒt þai raʒt me the septre.'
	þe bisshop baythes hym ʒet with bale at his hert,
þaghe men mensked him so, how hit myʒt worthe
þat his clothes were so clene. 'In cloutes, me þynkeʒ,
Hom burde have rotid and bene rent in rattes longe syþen .
þi body may be enbawmyd, hit bashis me noght
þat hit thar ryve no rote ne no ronk wormeʒ;
Bot þi colour ne þi clothe   I know in no wyse
How hit myʒt lye by monnes lore and last so longe.'
'Nay, bisshop,' quod þat body, 'enbawmyd wos I neuer,
Ne no monnes counselle my cloth has keped vnwemmyd,
Bot þe ryche kyng of resoun, þat ryʒt euer alowes
And loves al þe lawes lelly þat longen to trawthe;
And moste he menskes men for mynnynge of ryʒtes

And if renkes for ryʒt þus me arayed has,
He has lent me to last þat loves ryʒt best.'
	'ʒe, bot sayes þou of þi saule' þen sayd þe bisshop;
'Quere is ho stabled and stadde, if þou so streʒt wroʒteʒ?
He þat rewardeʒ uche a renk as he has ryʒt serued
Myʒt euel forgo the to gif of his grace summe braunche.
For as he says in his sothe psalmyde writtes:
"þe scylful and þe vnskathely skelton ay to me."
Forþi say me of þi saule, in sele quere ho woneʒ,
And of þe ryche restorment þat raʒt hyr oure Lorde.'
þen hummyd he þat þer lay and his hede waggyd,
And gef a gronynge ful grete and to Godde sayde:
'Maʒty maker of men, thi myʒtes are grete;
How myʒt þi mercy to me amount any tyme?
Nas I a paynym vnpreste þat neuer thi plyt knewe,
Ne þe mesure of þi mercy ne þi mukel vertue,
Bot ay a freke faitheles þat fayled þi laghes

I was non of þe noumbre þat þou with nye boghtes
With þe blod of thi body vpon þe blo rode.
Quen þou herghdes helle hole and hentes hom þeroute,
þi loffynge out of limbo, þou laftes me þer,
And þer sittes my saule þat se may no fyrre,
Dwynande in þe derke deth þat dyʒt vs oure fader,

Bot mendyd with a mendecyn ʒe are made for to lyue

And þat han we myst alle mercyles, myselfe and my saule.
Quat wan we with oure wele dede þat wroʒten ay ryʒt,
Quen we are dampnyd delfully into þe depe lake,
And exilid fro þat soper so, þat solempne fest,

My saule may sitte þer in sorʒe and sike ful colde,
Dynly in þat derke dethe þer dawes neuer morn,

Longe er ho þat soper se oþer segge hyr to lathe.'
	þus delfully þis dede body deuised hit sorʒe
þat alle weped for woo þe wordes þat herde,
And þe bysshop balefully bere doun his yʒen,
þat hade no sace to speke, so spakly he ʒoskyd,
Til he toke hym a tom and to þe toumbe loked,
To þe liche þer hit lay, with lauande teres.
'Oure lorde lene', quod þat lede, 'þat þou lyf hades,

And cast vpon þi fayre corsand carp þes wordes,

With þat worde þat he warpped, þe wete of yʒen
And teres trillyd adoun and on þe toumbe lyʒten,
And one felle on his face, and þe freke syked.
þen sayd he with a sadde soun: 'Oure sauyour be loued!

And blessed be þat blyssful oure þat ho the bere in!
And also be þou, bysshop, þe bote of my sorʒe
And þe relefe of þe lodly lures þat my saule has levyed in!
For þe wordes þat þou warp and þe water þat þou schedde,

For with þe wordes and þe water þat wesche vs of payne,

Into þe cenacle solemply þer suppe all trwe;
And þer a marcialle hyr mette with menske alþer grattest,
And with reverence a roum he raʒt hyr for euer.

	Wyt this sesed his soun, sayd he no more,
Bot sodenly his swete chere swyndid and fayled
And all the ble of his body wos blake as þe moldeʒ,
As roten as þe rottok þat ryses in powdere.
For as sone as þe saule was sesed in blysse,

For þe ay lastande lyf þat lethe shall neuer

And all þe belles in þe burghe beryd at ones.
