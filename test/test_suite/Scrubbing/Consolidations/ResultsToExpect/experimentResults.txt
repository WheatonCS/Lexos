Mary had a little lamb,
whase fleece was white as snaw.

And everywhere that Mary went,
the lamb was sure ta ga.

It fallawed her ta schaal ane day
which was against the rules.

It made the children laugh and play,
ta see a lamb at schaal.

And sa the teacher turned it aut,
but still it lingered near,

And waited patiently abaut,
till Mary did appear.

"Why daes the lamb lave Mary sa?"
the eager children cry.

"Why, Mary laves the lamb, yau knaw."
the teacher did reply.
