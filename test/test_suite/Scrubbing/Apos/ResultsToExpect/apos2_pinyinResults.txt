澳門 or is separated by a hyphen rìé zhànzhēng 日俄战争 in the case of the erhua

apostrophe reduces ambiguity in word boundaries xī'ān 西安 for example might be
interpreted as a single syllable xiān 先 if the apostrophe and the tones were
not present without the apostrophe fāng'àn 方案 could be confused with fǎngǎn
反感 some writers such as the library of congress write fǎn'gǎn but this
