Margaret had the tiny sheep,
whose fleece was white as snow.

And everywhere that Margaret went,
the sheep was sure to go.

It followed her to school one day
which was against the rules.

It made the children laugh and play,
to see the sheep at school.

And so the teacher turned it out,
but still it lingered near,

And waited patiently about,
till Margaret did appear.

"Why does the sheep love Margaret so?"
the eager children cry.

"Why, Margaret loves the sheep, you know."
the teacher did reply.
