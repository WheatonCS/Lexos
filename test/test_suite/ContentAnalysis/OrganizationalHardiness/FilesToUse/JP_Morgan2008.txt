meet every challenge and in the process we distinguishedourselves in our service to clients and communities although our financial resultswere weak in absolute terms but fairly good in relative terms reflecting terriblemarket conditions i believeand i hope you agreethat this year may have been oneof our finestthe way forward will not be easy we do not know what the future will bring but we doknow that it will require everyone the banks the regulators and the government  towork together and get it right as we prepare for a very tough  with most signspointing to continued deterioration of the

confidence in our ability to build a stronger more vibrant companyfor the future i review of  financialperformance and business resultsjpmorgan chase earned nearly  billion in down  from the  billion we earned in the prioryear during a normal credit cycle and environmentwe should earn more than  billion so clearly thiswas not a great year financially essentially the yearsfinancial results were marred by two issues both ofwhich were highlighted as major risks in last yearsletter the first related to increasing credit costs mostlyfor consumer and mortgage loans the secondresulted from investment bank writedowns of morethan  billion primarily from leveraged lending andmortgage exposuresthroughout this financial crisis we have benefitedfrom a fortress balance sheet we started this

businesses now ranks as one of the topthree players in its respective industry as ever ourgoal is to be the best not necessarily the biggest thatsaid we know that size matters in businesses whereeconomies of scale  in areas such as systems operationsinnovation branding and risk diversification can be critical to success the only reason to getbigger and gain economies of scale is when doing soenables you to do a better job for your clients ie bygiving them more better and faster at a lower costultimately this is also the only real reason to do amerger  the client gets something better if this isntthe case big can be bad if bureaucracy hubris lack ofattention to detail  or other ailments of large corporations overwhelm the benefits of size then failure willultimately resultwe are also keenly aware of the value added at moredetailed levels in our businesses for example inretail financial services we gained share with smallbusinesses as we expanded our brand footprint

gettingstronger even in tough years like  and we did not  and will not  stop doing all the thingsthat make our businesses better ii review of critical events ofthe yearin this section i want to review some of the criticalevents for us this past year the purchase of bear stearns the purchase of washington mutual the gathering storm that arrived with a vengeance the acceptance of government tarpa the purchase of bear stearnson may   we closed our acquisition of bearstearns  a deal completed in record time under trulyextraordinary circumstancesover the weekend of march  we were asked by theus government to assist in preventing bear stearnsfrom going bankrupt before the opening of the asianmarkets on monday morning the possibility was realthat if bear stearns had been allowed to go bankruptit could have had a cataclysmic effect on the financialmarkets many believe that later experiences withlehman brothers essentially proved this to be true toa person our board of directors felt jpmorgan chasehad a special obligation to do all we could to help especiallyknowing that we were among the few companies if not the only one  in a position to do so howeverthis deal posed more risks and threatened to be morebackbreaking than any other acquisition we had done inthe past and it had to make sense for our shareholdersgoing into this deal we had two things in our favorthe strength of our balance sheet and capital base andthe skill of our peopleour first priority was to quickly reduce our downsiderisk this required us to massively derisk bear stearnsquickly and in potentially dangerous markets bearstearns had approximately  billion in assets thatwe needed to consolidate into our financial and risk systemsand reduce quickly to approximately  billionof assets we had to manage this reduction so that theremaining risk was manageable and wellcontrolled thepotential downside  given the treacherous markets was enormous we asked the government to financeand assume the risk on approximately  billion ofmortgage assets compared with our  billion of totalassets acquired from bear stearns the portion thatthe government agreed to take comprised the less riskymortgage assets we kept the most risky mortgageassets we simply could not and would not take onany more mortgage risk  it would have been extremelyirresponsible and remember the government couldfinance the assets much more cheaply than we couldand could hold them as it saw fit whereas we wouldhave been forced to sell them immediatelyunder normal conditions the price we ultimately paidfor bear stearns would have been considered low bymost standards but these were not normal conditionsand because of the risk we were taking we needed ahuge margin for error we were not buying a house we were buying a house on firewe paid  billion for bear stearns a company thathad reported a little more than  billion in commonequity we knew that most  but we hoped not all  ofthe common equity we were buying would be used forclosedown costs litigation expenses severance costsand most important quickly eliminating the risk on thebalance sheet we have largely completed this task butunfortunately all of the equity was used up in thisprocess and several billions more in losses ran throughour income statement in the second half of despite these additional costs we still believe thatbear stearns has added significantly to our franchisein particular it completed our franchise in twoareas where we were weak prime brokerage andcommodities and it enhanced our broader equity andfixed income businesses ultimately we expect thebusinesses we acquired to add approximately  billionof annual earnings to the companythe truly impressive part of the bear stearns deal wasthe human side  seeing our people rise to the challengeunder a great deal of strain on thursday nightmarch  i called our investment banking heads steveblack and bill winters who then called our financeaudit tax trading and banking professionals as well aslegal real estate and systems teams around the world many of whom got out of bed and went back to work soon hundreds returned to work that night by theweekend thousands of people from around the worldwere working around the clock these professionalsably managed the due diligence work and gave us theconfidence we needed to complete the deal theirherculean effort over that weekend and the next severalmonths made it possible for us to sign and close thedeal in about  days if you could have seen what isaw during that intensely stressful time you wouldhave been very proud of the team at jpmorgan chaseb the purchase of wamuon september  the federal deposit insurancecorporation fdic seized the banking assets ofwashington mutual in the largest bank failure inhistory moments later we acquired the depositsassets and certain liabilities of washington mutualfor approximately  billion we now know thatjpmorgan chase was the only bank prepared to actimmediately we acquired wamus  branches atms and  million checking accounts aswell as savings mortgage and credit card accountsimportantly we did not acquire the assets or liabilitiesof the banks holding company or assume the billion of senior unsecured debt and subordinateddebt of washington mutuals banksthe deal was financially compelling  it was immediatelyaccretive to earnings and it will add an estimated billion or  cents per share to our  results andincreasingly more thereafter to achieve these anticipatedearnings we did not rely on heroic revenueassumptions instead we mostly relied on expectedcost savings net of the large investments in thetechnology and refurbishment of the branches of billion we now expect to achieve cost savings of morethan  billion we also plan to complete all rebrandingand system conversions by the end of this yearwith the acquisition of wamu we purchased approximately billion of mortgage and mortgagerelatedassets with  billion in deposits and  billion inequity we immediately wrote down most of the bador impaired assets approximately  billion properlyreserved for the remaining assets and establishedreserves for severance and closedown costs afterrecognizing all of these costs we believe that we nowhave a relatively clean company that came withapproximately  billion in good common equityour due diligence on wamus assets was extensiveand our assumptions were conservative we assumedthat home prices would go down another  fromthe day we closed providing a healthy margin forerror however if home prices go down more thanexpected say  all other things being equal thiscould cost us  billion billion more even underthese circumstances we think the transaction willremain a great deal at a great price for our shareholderswe are confident that it will add enormous valueto jpmorgan chase in the futuregiven our conservative nature we sold  billion incommon stock the morning after the deal announcementto maintain our strong capital base the capital raise upsized due to strong response from investors  was thelargest us common stock followon offering ever executedin addition wamus retail deposits contributedto our stable funding base and liquidity positionin prior years we consistently expressed our desire tobroaden our retail footprint to attractive regions suchas the west coast and florida  as long as the planmade good sense financially and we could execute thetransaction effectively the wamu transaction alignedperfectly with this criteria specifically it expands ourretail franchise into fastgrowing new markets withestablished branches bolsters our presence in oursignificant footprint states and over time will allowus to extend the reach of our commercial bankingbusiness banking credit card and wealth managementefforts these additional businesses were not heritagestrengths of wamu but in effect can be built on topof the wamu branches and we hope eventually willadd another  million to our earnings this willtake many years and was not built into our originalassumptions an expanded product line togetherwith enhanced systems will benefit former wamucustomers tremendously our people across the business  together with ourexperts in systems marketing legal finance audit andhuman resources  did an outstanding job executingthis transaction making it possible for us to take thisimportant strategic stepc the gathering storm arrived with a vengeance and how jpmorgan chase faredin  bear stearns collapsed lehman brothersdeclared bankruptcy fannie mae and freddie macwere placed into government conservatorship thegovernment assumed majority ownership of aigmerrill lynch sold itself to bank of america wellsfargo took over a struggling wachovia indymac andwamu went into receivership by the federal

globe french british swiss and germanbanks were rescued by their governments and theworld entered the sharpest most globalized downturnsince the great depressionas for jpmorgan chase we had large credit and operationalexposures in virtually every situation mentionedabove affecting nearly every line of business ourfirms management teams credit officers risk officersand legal finance audit and compliance teams workedtirelessly to protect the company we believe it is aconsiderable sign of strength that we could managethrough such extraordinary problems with minimallosses to the companywe avoided many critical problems that would havemade things far worsein last years letter we focused on our problems including mortgage issues in retail financial servicesand writedowns in the investment bank of leveragedloans and mortgage securities those issues cost us aconsiderable amount of money in  and will continueto cost us money in  but it also is instructiveto focus on how we were able to avoid certain problemscontrol the damage and minimize the costin  we essentially stayed away from sponsoring structuredinvestment vehicles siv because we viewedthem as arbitrage vehicles with plenty of risk and alimited business purpose we also minimized ourfinancing to sivs for the same reasons and back in we sold the only small siv we had sponsored we didnt write option arms adjustable ratemortgages because we did not think they were aconsumerfriendly product although we madeplenty of mistakes in the mortgage business thiswas not one of them we substantially cut back on subprime early in thecrisis while subprime mortgages cost us nearly billion in  we avoided far worse results becausewe had significantly reduced our exposures in this was true both in the mortgage business and inthe investment bank we never built up the structured finance businesswhile we are a large player in the assetbackedsecurities market we deliberately avoided the structuredcollateralized debt obligation cdo businessbecause we believed the associated risks were toohigh structured finance in its most complicatedforms such as cdosquared has largely disappearedafter unleashing a myriad of problems onthe financial system they will not be missed we did not unduly leverage our capital nor did werely on lowquality forms of capital we always hadhigh targets of  to  tier  capital we alwaysbelieved in highquality capital which amongother things means conservative accounting strongloan loss reserves and a high component of tangiblecommon equity the higher the quality of capitalthe more prepared one is for tough times we maintained a high level of liquidity  and werealways prepared for unexpected draws ie collateralcalls strong liquidity is a constant for us the factthat we have total deposits of  trillion across ourretail and wholesale businesses positions the firmadvantageously overall and has helped us weatherthe worst of the crisis we will do whatever it takesto ensure that our liquidity remains a strong part ofour fortress balance sheet so that we can maintainflexibility during challenging times to be in a positionto support our clients we avoided shortterm funding of illiquid assetsand we essentially do not rely on wholesale fundingof our  trillion of deposits approximately billion is referred to as wholesale but it essentiallyis comprised of deposits that corporate clients leavewith us in the normal course of business  ie theyare sticky and not like brokered certificates ofdeposit or hot money that move on a whim for onebasis point simply put we still follow the financialcommandment do not borrow short to invest longd the acceptance of government tarpon october   i went to washington dc witheight chief executives of other financial firms therewe were asked by the secretary of the treasury thechairman of the federal reserve the office of thecomptroller of the currency occ the fdic and thenew york federal reserve bank to agree to accept apackage of capital from the government as part of itstroubled asset relief program tarp the us governmentwas proposing some powerful measures tohelp fix the collapse in the credit and lending marketsthey prevailed upon the nine of us to set an examplefor others by accepting this capital infusion as a signof our unanimous support of these measures the logicwas that a massive infusion of capital into the usbanking system would pave the way for the industryas a whole to extend more credit than they otherwisewould have provided the governments view was alsothat if any of the banks declined the tarp funds thenmany of the additional banks might not want to betainted by their acceptance of the tarp moneybecause it might be viewed as a sign of weaknesswe felt then that accepting the tarp funds was the rightthing to do for the us financial system  even though itmay not have been as beneficial for jpmorgan chase asit was for some of the othersin short we did not ask for the tarp capital infusionand we did not feel we needed it our tier  capital atyearend would have been  without it in factthe tarp program had asymmetric benefits to thoseaccepting it ie it was least beneficial to strong companieslike ours and vice versa that said we believethat accepting the tarp funds was the right thing todo for the us financial system  and that jpmorganchase should not be parochial or selfish and stand inthe way of actions that the government wanted to taketo help the whole financial system we think the government acted boldly in a very toughsituation the outcome of which could have possibly beenfar worse had it not taken such stepsthe government acted quickly and boldly  takingunorthodox steps to try to right the ship it had to actwith urgency while dealing with complex and rapidlychanging problems that did not lend themselves tosimplistic solutions while we will never actuallyknow we believe as many economists and analysts dothat without these and other actions the governmenthas taken to date things could have been much worseso while it is easy to criticize the timing marketing orconsistency of the effort  we also recognize how hardit is to act boldly in difficult and dangerous times weshould remind ourselves of what president theodoreroosevelt expressed nearly a century agoit is not the critic who counts not the man who pointsout how the strong man stumbles or where the doer ofdeeds could have done them better the credit belongsto the man who is actually in the arena whose face ismarred by dust and sweat and blood who strivesvaliantly who errs who comes short again and againbecause there is no effort without error and shortcomingbut who does actually strive to do the deeds whoknows great enthusiasms the great devotions whospends himself in a worthy cause who at the bestknows in the end the triumph of high achievement andwho at the worst if he fails at least fails while daringgreatly so that his place shall never be with those coldand timid souls who neither know victory nor defeatwe hope that our leaders will continue to be boldand brave in seeking solutions to these onceinagenerationproblemsbanks are lending and the tarp is probably helpingit is important to recognize that tarp capital is only of our total capital it is also important to recognizethat to the extent we use the money and lose itthe risk is  ours because we still owe the moneyback to the government despite that we and otherbanks are trying to use tarp capital to benefit shareholdersclients and communities in the fourth quarterof  alone we extended more than  billion innew credit to consumers businesses municipalitiesand notforprofit organizations including nearly billion in home lending and  billion in auto lendingwe increased loans and commitments to governmentunits health care companies and notforprofitsby  in  and plan to increase lending to thesegroups by  billion in  we also completed severalmajor syndicated leveraged finance loans and inone critical instance we bought the entire  billionbond issue from the state of illinois when no oneelse would bid for it giving illinois the financing forpayroll and other important needs finally we remainvery active in the interbank market where banks lendto each other and have had on average  billion to billion out in the interbank market each nightwhile total lending by banks fluctuates according tothe markets and changing credit conditions we dobelieve that tarp has enabled many banks to increasetheir lending in certain key areas  more than theyotherwise would have donewhile we clearly understood that there might bepotential mostly political unintended consequencesof tarp we believed that it would help the usfinancial system at that critical moment iii fundamental causes andcontributions to the financialcrisisafter lehmans collapse the global financial systemwent into cardiac arrest there is much debate overwhether lehmans crash caused it  but looking backi believe the cumulative trauma of all the aforementionedevents and some large flaws in the financialsystem are what caused the meltdown if it hadntbeen lehman something else would have been thestraw that broke the camels backthe causes of the financial crisis will be written aboutanalyzed and subject to historical revisions for decadesany view that i express at this moment will likelybe proved incomplete or possibly incorrect over timehowever i still feel compelled to attempt to do sobecause regulation will be written soon in the nextyear or so that will have an enormous impact on ourcountry and our company if we are to deal properlywith this crisis moving forward we must be brutallyhonest and have a full understanding of what causedit in the first place the strength of the united stateslies not in its ability to avoid problems but in ourability to face problems to reform and to change soit is in that spirit that i share my viewsalbert einstein once said make everything as simpleas possible but not simpler simplistic answers orblanket accusations will lead us astray any plan forthe future must be based on a clear and comprehensiveunderstanding of the key underlying causes of and multiple contributors to  the crisis whichinclude the following the burst of a major housing bubble excessive leverage pervaded the system the dramatic growth of structural risks andthe unanticipated damage they caused regulatory lapses and mistakes the procyclical nature of virtually all policiesactions and events the impact of huge trade and financing imbalanceson interest rates consumption and speculationeach main cause had multiple contributing factorsas i wrote about these causes it became clear to methat each main cause and the related contributorscould easily be rearranged and still be fairly accurateit was also surprising to realize that many of themain causes in fact were known and discussed abundantlybefore the crisis however no one predictedthat all of these issues would come together in theway that they did and create the largest financial andeconomic crisis of our lifetimeeven the more conservative of us and i considermyself to be among them looked at the past majorcrises the   and  recessions the  and market crashes or some mix of them as the worstcaseevents for which we needed to be prepared weeven knew that the next one would be different  butwe missed the ferocity and magnitude that was lurkingbeneath it also is possible that had this crisis playedout differently the massive and multiple vicious cyclesof asset price reductions a declining economy and ahousing price collapse all might have played out differently either more benignly or more violentlyit is critical to understand that the capital marketstoday are fundamentally different than they were afterworld war ii this is not your grandfathers economythe role of banks in the capital markets has changedconsiderably and this change is not wellunderstood  infact it is fraught with misconceptions traditional banksnow provide only  of total lending in the economyapproximately  trillion of the total credit providedby all financial intermediaries right after world war iithat number was almost  the other lending hasbeen provided by what many call the shadow bankingsystem shadow implies nefarious and in the dark butonly part of this shadow banking system was in the darkie sivs and conduits  the rest was right in front of usmoney market funds which had grown to  trillion ofassets directly lend to corporations by buying commercialpaper they owned  billion of commercial paperbond funds which had grown to approximately  trillionalso were direct buyers of corporate credit and securitizationssecuritizations which came in many formsincluding cdos collateralized loan obligations and commercial mortgagebacked securities either directly orindirectly bought consumer and commercial loans assetsecuritizations simply were a conduit by which investmentand commercial banks passed the loans onto theultimate buyersin the two weeks after the lehman bankruptcy moneymarket and bond funds withdrew approximately billion from the credit markets they did this becauseinvestors ie individuals and institutions withdrewmoney from these funds at the same time bank lendingactually went up as corporations needed to increasinglyrely on their banks for lending with this as abackdrop lets revisit the main causes of this crisis inmore detaila the burst of a major housing bubbleus home prices have been appreciating for almost years  essentially doubling over that time whilesome appreciation is normal the large appreciationin this case and the ultimate damage it caused werecompounded by the factors discussed belownew and poorly underwritten mortgage productsie option arms subprime mortgages helped fuelasset appreciation excessive speculation and far highercredit lossesas the housing bubble grew increasingly aggressiveunderwriting standards helped drive housing priceappreciation and market speculation to unprecedentedlevels poor underwriting standards including little orno verification of income and loantovalue ratios ashigh as  and poorly designed new products likeoption arms contributed directly to the bubble andits disastrous aftermathmortgage securitization had two major flawsin many securitizations no one along the chain fromoriginator to distributor had ultimate responsibility forthe results of the underwriting in addition the poorlyconstructed tranches of securitizations that comprisedthese transactions effectively converted a large portionof poorly underwritten loans into triple arated securitiesclearly the rating agencies also played a key rolein this flawed process these securitizations ended upin many forms the one most discussed is cdosessentially these just added a lot more fuel to the firewhile most people are honorable excess speculation anddishonesty were far greater than ever seen before on thepart of both brokers and consumersthe combination of nomoneydown mortgages speculationon home prices and some dishonest brokersand consumers who outandout lied will cause damagefor years to come this in no way absolves the poorunderwriting judgments made by us and other institutionsand it certainly doesnt absolve anyone whomissold loans to consumersb excessive leverage pervaded the systemover many years consumers were adding to theirleverage mostly as a function of the housing bubblesome commercial banks increased theirs most of theus investment banks dramatically increased theirsand many foreign banks had the most leverage of allin addition increasing leverage appeared in hedge funds many using high leverage grew dramaticallyover time some of that leverage was theresult of global banks and investment banks lendingthem too much money private equity firms were increasingly leveraging uptheir buyouts again some banks and the capitalmarkets lent them too much money some banks and other entities added to their leverageby using offbalance sheet arbitrage vehicles likesivs and leveraged puts nonbank entities including mortgage banks cdomanagers consumer and commercial finance companiesand even some bond funds all increased theirleverage over time even pension plans and universities added to theirleverage often in effect by making large forward commitmentsbasically the whole world was at the party high onleverage  and enjoying it while it lasted c the dramatic growth of structural risks and theunanticipated damage they causedi believe there are four structural risks or imbalancesthat grew and coalesced to cause a run on the bankbut this was not a traditional bank run  it was a runon our capital markets the likes of which we had neverexperienced after lehmans bankruptcy many partsof our capital markets system stopped providing anycapital to the market at all if the crisis had unfoldeddifferently then perhaps the events that followedwould not have occurred surely no one deliberatelybuilt a system with these fundamental flaws and imbalancesclearer heads will understand that much of thiswas not malfeasance  our world had changed a lot andin ways that we didnt understand the full potentialrisk but when the panic started it was too much forthe system to bearmany structures increasingly allowed shorttermfinancing to support illiquid assetsin essence too much longerterm noninvestmentgrade product was converted into shorterterm triplearated product some banks hedge funds sivs andcdos were using shortterm financing to support illiquidlongterm assets when the markets froze theseentities were unable to get shortterm financing as aresult they were forced to sell these illiquid assetsone of the functions of banking and the capital marketsis to intermediate between the needs of investorsand issuers this triggers a normal conversion eitherdirectly or indirectly through securitizations oflongerterm illiquid assets held by the issuers whoneed to finance the business into the shortertermhighergrade product that most investors want clearlyover time this imbalance had grown too large andunsupportablemoney market funds had a small structural risk whichbecame a critical point of failuremoney market funds promise to pay back  to theinvestor on demand many money market funds investedin  today commercial paper or assetbackedsecurities that under typical circumstances could besold back at par in normal times investors demandedtheir money in fairly predictable ways and funds wereable to meet their demands over time money marketfunds grew dramatically to exceed  trillion afterlehman collapsed one money fund in particularwhich held a lot of lehman paper was unable to meetthe withdrawal demands as word of that situationspread investors in many funds responded by demandingtheir money in a twoweek period investors pulled billion from many money funds which wereforced to sell assets aggressively to raise liquiditythese money funds essentially were forced to sellassets as investors moved away from credit funds andinto government funds the banks simply were unableto make up the difference this became one more hugerupture in the dikerepo financing terms got too loose and too many illiquidassets were repoedover time in those markets where financial companiesfinanced their liquid assets financial terms hadbecome too lax for example to buy nonagency mortgagesecurities financial institutions only had to putup  versus a more traditional  therepo markets also had begun to finance fairly esotericsecurities and when things got scary they simplystopped doing so in the two weeks after lehmansbankruptcy more than  billion was removed fromthis type of financing by both investors and banksonce again financial institutions had to liquidatesecurities to pay back shortterm borrowing  thusanother rupture in the dikeinvestors acted wisely to protect themselves but the systemcouldnt handle them all doing it at the same timeindividual investors corporations pension plans bondand loan funds money market funds and others  allacted in their own selfinterest and all individuallyacted wisely but collectively they caused enormousflows out of the banking and credit system regardlessof whether the funds came out of a bank a moneyfund or a bond or loan fund the fact remains that thecumulative result was a severe shortage of necessarycredit that was removed from the system clearly things had changed in the past regulators hadfocused on preventing a systemic collapse of the mainintermediaries in the financial system ie the banksin this new world however we need to discuss how toprotect ourselves not only from runs on banks but alsofrom runs on other critical vehicles in the capital andfinancial marketsd regulatory lapses and mistakeswith great hesitation i would like to point out thatmistakes also were made by the regulatory systemthat said i do not blame the regulators for what happenedin each and every circumstance the responsibilityfor a companys actions rests with us the ceo andthe companys management just because regulatorslet you do something it does not mean you should doit but regulators have a responsibility too and if weare ever to get this right it is important to examinewhat the regulators could have done better in manyinstances good regulation could have prevented some ofthe problems and had some of these problems not happenedperhaps things would not have gotten this badunregulated or lightly regulated parts of the marketcontributed to the crisisive already discussed some of the flaws with moneymarket funds and hedge funds  the latter were notregulated and the former were lightly regulated inaddition there are two large segments among othersthat  had they been regulated  could have helped thesystem avoid some problems much of the mortgage business was largely unregulatedwhile the banks in this business were regulatedmost mortgage brokers essentially were not in factno major commercial bank that was regulated by theocc wrote option arms possibly the worst mortgageproduct a very good argument could be madethat the lower standards of the unregulated parts ofthe business put a lot of pressure on those playersin the regulated part of the business to reduce theirstandards so they could compete in this case badregulation trumped good regulation insurance regulators essentially missed the largeand growing onesided credit insurance and creditderivative bets being made by aig and the monolineinsurers this allowed these companies to take hugeonesided bets in some cases by insuring variouscomplex mortgage securitiesbasel ii which was adopted by global banks and usinvestment banks allowed too much leverageit is quite clear now that the second of the accords bythe basel committee on banking supervision knownas basel ii published in  was highly flawed itwas applied differently in different jurisdictionsallowed too much leverage had an overreliance onpublished credit ratings and failed to account for how acompany was being funded ie it allowed too muchshortterm wholesale funding in  the five independentus investment banks adopted basel ii underthe jurisdiction of the securities and exchangecommission this was not allowed by the banks regulatedby the federal reserve or the occ whichremained under basel i the investment banks jettisonedprior conservative net capital requirements andgreatly increased their leverage under basel ii and therest is historyperhaps the largest regulatory failure of all time was theinadequate regulation of fannie mae and freddie macthe extraordinary growth and high leverage of fanniemae and freddie mac were wellknown many talkedabout these issues including their use of derivativessurprisingly they had their own regulator which clearlywas not up to the task these governmentsponsoredentities had grown to become larger than the federalreserve both had dramatically increased their leverageover the last  years and amazingly a situation wasallowed to exist where the very fundamental premiseof their credit was implicit not explicit this shouldnever happen again their collapse caused damage tothe mortgage markets and the financial system andhad the treasury not stepped in it would have causeddamage to the credit of the united states itself too many regulators  with overlapping responsibilitiesand inadequate authorities  were illequipped to handlethe crisisour current regulatory system is poorly organized andarchaic overlapping responsibilities have led to a diffusionof responsibility and an unproductive competitionamong regulators which probably accelerated arace to the bottom many regulators also did not havethe appropriate statutory authority through no faultof their own to deal with some of the problems theywere about to face one large glaring example revealedby the collapse of bear stearns and lehman was thelack of a resolution process in place to deal with failureof investment banks if commercial banks fail thefdic can take them over this was not the case withinvestment banks in addition a resolution processneeds to be in place for large global financial companiesthat operate in many jurisdictions and use manydifferent regulatory licensese the procyclical nature of virtually all policiesactions and eventsin a crisis procyclical policies make things worse icannot think of one single policy that acted as a counterbalanceto all of the procyclical forces althoughregulation can go only so far in minimizing the impactof procyclical forces in times of crisis we still must beaware of the impact they have for example loan loss reserving causes reserves to be at theirlowest level right when things take a turn for theworse therefore as a crisis unfolds a bank not onlyfaces higher chargeoffs but also has to add to itslevel of reserves depleting precious capital although we are proponents of fair value accountingin trading books a lot of the marktomarket lossesthat people complained about will end up being reallosses we also recognize that market levels resultingfrom large levels of forced liquidations may notreflect underlying values certain applications offair value accounting can contribute to a downwardspiral where losses deplete capital and lower capitalcauses people to respond by selling more at increasinglylower values the rating agencies made mistakes like the rest ofus that clearly helped fuel a cdo and mortgagedebacle they also in the midst of a crisis continuallydowngraded credits lower ratings in turnrequired many financial institutions to raise morecapital thus adding to the vicious cycle in bad times the market itself demands both anincrease in capital and more conservative lendingwe may not be able to change this phenomenonbut there are steps we can take to ensure that thesystem is better prepared for it financing arrangements allow the most leverage ingood times but they force a dramatic reduction inleverage in bad times as capital markets volatility increases basel iicapital calculations and many risk managementtools like valueatrisk demand that more capitalbe held to own securities or loansf the impact of huge trade and financing imbalanceson interest rates consumption and speculationi suspect when analysts and economists study thefundamental causes of this crisis they will point to theenormous us trade deficit as one of the main underlyingculprits over an eightyear period the unitedstates ran a trade deficit of  trillion this means thatamericans bought  trillion more than they sold overseasdollars were used to pay for the goods foreigncountries took these dollars and purchased for themost part us treasuries and mortgagebacked securities it also is likely that this process kept us interestrates very low even beyond federal reserve policy foran extended period of time it is likely that this excessdemand also kept risk premiums ie credit spreadsat an alltime low for an extended period of time lowinterest rates and risk premiums probably fueled excessiveleverage and speculation excess consumptioncould be financed cheaply and adding fuel to the firein the summer of  the united states had its thirdenergy crisis  further imbalancing capital flowsthere have been times when large imbalances  such asthose in trade  sort themselves out without causingmassive global disruption however it is bad planningand wishful thinking to assume that this will always bethe case these imbalances shouldnt be allowed to getthat large  they create too much potential riskmany other factors may have added to this storm  anexpensive war in iraq shortselling high energy pricesand irrational pressure on corporations money managersand hedge funds to show increasingly betterreturns it also is clear that excessive poorly designedand shortterm oriented compensation practices addedto the problem by rewarding a lot of bad behaviorthe modern financial world has had its first majorfinancial crisis so far many major actors are gonemany of the mortgage brokers numerous hedge fundswachovia wamu bear stearns lehman and manyothers some of the survivors are struggling particularlyas we face a truly global massive recession  and itstill is not overiv the future of our systemthe extent of the damage and the magnitude of thesystemic problems make it clear that our rules and regulationsmust be completely overhauled such changesto the regulatory system could have huge implicationson the longterm health and strategies of our businesswhile unprecedented actions have been taken by boththe federal reserve and the treasury my hope is thatnew policies are grounded in a thorough analysis of whathappened and what we need to do about it politicalagendas or simplistic views will not serve us welloften we hear the debate around the need for moreor less regulation what we need is better and moreforwardlooking regulation someone has famously saidthat a crisis should not go to waste but what is also trueis that it shouldnt take a crisis to solve our problemsduring a crisis people panic this can make it hardernot easier to do the right thing from our perspectivecertain improvements would make a big difference wewould like to share with you some of our suggestionsa the need for a systemic regulator with muchbroader authoritywe agree with our leaders in government that weshould move ahead quickly to establish a systemic regulatorin the short term this would allow us to focusattention on correcting some underlying weaknessesin our system and filling the gaps in regulation thatcontributed to the current situation it also is clear thatus policy must be coordinated with the proper set ofinternational regulators when the crisis emerged theactions of individual countries had a critical impact onnumerous other countries international coordinationis essential in resolving this kind of crisisthere should be procedures in place to deal withsystemically important institutions  failure is fineas long as its orderly and controlled and doesnt causesystemic failuresize is not the issue rather it is when institutions aretoo interconnected that an uncontrolled failure has thepotential to bring the whole system down what weneed is a resolution process that allows failure withoutcausing damage to the whole system in the case of bearstearns or lehman  both investment banks  regulatorsdid not have this protocol they do have it howeverfor commercial banks even more important regulatorsare going to need a resolution process for largeglobal corporations that operate in many jurisdictionsaround the worldthe first goal should be to regulate financial institutionsso they dont fail if they do fail a proper resolutionprocess would ensure that action is swift appropriateand consistent the lack of consistency alonecaused great confusion in the marketplace for examplewhen some of the recent failures took place therewas inconsistent treatment among capitalholders preferredstock and debt holders were treated very differentlyin different circumstances it would have beenbetter if the regulators had a resolution process thatdefined a priori what forms of aid companies would getand what the impact would be on capitalholders thefdic resolution process for banks provides a very goodexample of how a wellfunctioning process worksvarious liquidity and lender of last resort facilitieslike some of those put into place during this crisis alsocould be in place on an a priori basis these controlswould reduce risk and maximize confidenceregulation needs to be administered by product andeconomic substance not by legal entitywe have experienced the unintended consequences ofredundant regulation ie different agencies regulatingthe same product in the mortgage business in the derivativesbusiness and in lending overall if on the otherhand similar products were overseen by a single regulatorthat regulator would have much deeper knowledgeof the products and full information that extends acrossinstitutions the regulatory competition that couldhave caused a race to the bottom would be eliminatedhedge funds private equity funds and offbalance sheetvehicles must be included in our regulatory apparatuswithout compromising their freedoms and positive attributescertain vehicles like hedge funds and private equityfunds need to be regulated but only to protect the systemagainst risk these vehicles do not need to be heavilyregulated like a depositgathering bank we shouldconsider requiring hedge funds over a certain sizesay  billion of equity to register provide quarterlyaudited reports disclose total leverage and certain riskattributes  like volatility and investment categories and outline operational procedures they also could berequired to show their regulators not their competitorsany concentrated trades that could cause excessivesystemic risk this all could be done without compromisingflexibility or disclosing confidential positionswhile allowing these vehicles to move capital as freely and aggressively  as they see fitthe systemic regulator needs the ability to anticipate riskand do something about it if necessarythere undoubtedly are financial products in the markettoday that  if unchecked  could have a destabilizingeffect a systemic regulator had it been closelywatching the mortgage industry might have identifiedthe unregulated mortgage business as a critical pointof failure this regulator also might have been able tolimit the leverage of fannie and freddie once theywere deemed to pose major systemic risks such aregulator might have been in the position to recognizethe onesided credit derivative exposures of aig andthe monoline insurers and do something about ita systemic regulator also should be on the lookoutfor new or potential structural risks in our capitalmarkets such as the structural flaw that grew inmoney market fundsb the need to simplify our regulatory systemeveryone agrees that the existing system is fragmentedand overly complex we have too many regulators andtoo many regulatory gaps no one agency has access toall the relevant information responsibility often ishighly diffused this problem could be relatively easyto fix but only if we have the political will to fix itc the need to regulate the mortgage business including commercial mortgages  in its entiretymany of the same gaps in regulation that helped leadus into this mess still exist today  for example in the mortgage business mortgages are the largest financialproduct in the united states and while we do not wantto squelch innovation the entire mortgage businessclearly needs to be regulated this is not the first timethat mortgages and real estate have led this countryand many of its financial institutions into deep troubleproper regulation would go a long way toward standardizingproducts testing new ones improving customerdisclosure and clarifying responsibilityd the need to fix securitizationwe believe that securitization still is a highly effectiveway to finance assets but some securitizations particularlymortgage securitizations had an enormous flawbuilt into them no one was responsible for the actualquality of the underwriting even mortgage servicingcontracts were not standardized such that if somethingwent wrong the customer would get consistent resolutionwe cannot rely on market discipline ie eliminatingbad practices alone to fix this problemwe have heard several reasonable suggestions onhow the originator packager and seller of securitizationscould be appropriately incentivized to ensure goodunderwriting for example requiring the relevant partiesto keep part of the securitizations much like we do withsyndicated loans today would help manage resolution ifsomething were to go wrong and could go a long way toreestablish market confidence and proper accountabilitye the need to fix basel ii  leading to higher capitalratios but a more stable systemas discussed earlier basel ii has many flaws  it hastaken too long to implement it responds slowly tomarket changes and it is applied unevenly acrossglobal borders perhaps its worst failing is that in itscurrent construct basel ii does not include liquiditywhich allowed commercial and investment banks tobuy liquid or illiquid assets and fund them shortwhile this practice did not appear quite so dangerousin benign times it created huge issues for many financialinstitutions during the market crisis basel ii alsohas relied too heavily on rating agencies and by itsnature has been highly procyclical in its capitalrequirements for assets it would be easy to make thesecapital requirements less procyclical and require baselii to recognize the risk of shortterm funding particularlythat of wholesale funding finally basel ii shouldbe applied consistently reviewed continuously andupdated regularly the world changes quicklyf the need to get accounting under controlwe at jpmorgan chase are strong believers in goodconservative accounting accounting should alwaysreflect true underlying economics which actually ishow we run the company however accounting practicesare not widely understood are changed too frequentlyand are too susceptible to interpretation andmanipulation sometimes they even inadvertentlydetermine us government policywe generally like fair value accountingfor assets that are bought and sold fair value accountingcreates the best discipline fair value accountingoften referred to as marktomarket accountingalready provides for some flexibility if recent prices areunder highly distressed conditions in such cases goodjudgment and sound fundamental cash flowtype evaluationscan be employed to value certain assetshowever in our opinion the application of fair valueaccounting for certain categories needs to be reconsideredfor example we now have to mark to market our private equityinvestments by using potentially artificial benchmarksthese investments by their nature are veryilliquid and are intentionally held for several yearsto mark them to market proxies made up of comparablecompanies are used and appropriate discountsand judgments are applied essentially we writethese investments up when markets are good andwrite them down when markets are bad but i amfairly confident that this approach is not alwaysright in many instances cost is the best proxy forfair value we would rather describe our investmentsto our shareholders tell them when we think theseinvestments might be worth more and certainlywrite them down on our financial statements whenthey have become impaired a new marktomarket rule addresses debit valuationadjustments essentially we now have to markto market credit spreads on certain jpmorgan chasebonds that we issue for example when bond spreadswiden on jpmorgan chase debt we actually canbook a gain of course when these spreads narrowwe book a loss the theory is interesting but inpractice it is absurd taken to the extreme if a companyis on its way to bankruptcy it will be bookinghuge profits on its own outstanding debt right upuntil it actually declares bankruptcy  at which pointit doesnt matter it is becoming increasingly more difficult to comparemarktomarket values of certain instruments acrossdifferent companies while its too involved to go intodetail here different companies may account for similarmarktomarket assets differently this needs to beaddressed by ensuring that companies adhere to consistentvaluation principles while applying the rules fair value accounting does not and should not applyto all assets investments or certain illiquid assets thatare intended to be held for the longer term like realestate or plant and equipment or loans and certainassets that are shorter term like receivables or inventoryall could actually be marked to market thereare in fact markets for some of these assets and otherscould be calculated based on reasonable assumptionsfor example a farm would be worth morewhen corn prices go up and a semiconductor plantwould be worth less when semiconductor prices godown however if we marked these assets in thisway they would have wildly different prices dependingon the health of the economy or the swings inprices for their output while accounting shouldrecognize the real impairment in the value of assetsmarking the aforementioned assets to market everyday would be a waste of time under this scenario itwould be quite hard for companies to invest in anythingilliquid or to make longterm investmentsnew accounting rules that have the potential toinadvertently affect how the capital markets functionor change fundamental longterm us governmentpolicies should be made thoughtfully deliberatelyand with broad inputfor example we all believe that companies shouldhave fully funded pension plans ie the actual assetsin the plan should be enough to meet a fair estimate ofthe liabilities years ago if this wasnt the case companieswere allowed to maintain a deficit and fund itover several years that deficit was not recorded on thefinancial statement of the companya change in accounting rules dictated that the deficitshould not just be a footnote in the financial statementsbut that it should be reflected directly in theequity account of the corporation clearly in very badmarkets these deficits grow dramatically thus depletingthe increasingly precious capital that companieshave this is just another example of a procyclicalforce when companies realized they were gettingenormous volatility in their capital account they beganto curtail or eliminate their pension plans in favor ofk plans where the individual bears all the investmentrisk this was a rational precautionary step butit in effect transferred the risk from the company tothe individual no longer did the large corporationsassume the risk of providing a steady income stream toretired employees instead the risk was passed to theindividuals  many of whom could not afford itthis is a perfect example of how accounting inadvertentlysets policy and in my opinion this was probablythe wrong policy for the country there would havebeen many ways to be true to the economic purposeof accounting without making a detrimental policychange there are countless other examples and wehope regulators and accountants will eventually findbetter ways to apply accounting principlesg the need for appropriate countercyclical policiesduring this crisis it became evident that our systemcreated enormous procyclical tendencies in fact icant think of one countercyclical policy at all otherthan emergency actions taken by the government accounting policies such as marktomarket and loanloss reserving are procyclical basel ii capital requirementsare procyclical regulatory and legal requirementsare procyclical repo and shortterm financingare procyclical the one procyclical tendency weprobably can never correct is that of the market itselfie the cost of capital goes way up in a downturn orinvestors refuse to finance less liquid assets i haveheard many good ideas about how to create somecountercyclical policies and will focus on three hereloan loss reserving can easily be made countercyclicali find it absurd that loan loss reserves tend to be attheir lowest point precisely when things are about toget worse as things get worse and chargeoffs risedramatically one must dramatically increase loan lossreserves thus depleting capital rapidly this problemwould be solved if banks were allowed to estimatecredit losses over the life of their loan portfoliosreserves should be maintained to absorb those lossesthis would enable banks to increase reserves whenlosses are low and utilize reserves when losses arehigh transparency would be fully preserved becauseinvestors and regulators would still see actual chargeoffsand nonperformers this would require a rationalexplanation about the appropriateness of the lifetimeloss estimates it also would have the positive effect ofconstantly reminding ceos management teams andinvestors that bad times in fact do happen  and thatthey should be prepared for such eventsrepo and shortterm financing can easily be madecountercyclicalall banks now have access to the standard financingfacilities for securities and loans via the federalreserve ie the fed will lend a specific amount ofmoney against specific assets a suggestion is thisif an institution provides financing to clients in excessof what the fed would lend to the bank for the samesecurities it would have to be disclosed to risk committeesand the companys board of directors the fedthen would have two major tools to reduce leverageand in a way that is countercyclical  it could chargehigher capital costs to a bank when the bank is lendingmore than the fed would lend or the fed could reducethe amount it would lend to the banks market playerswould still be free to provide credit and leverage asthey see fitbanks should have the ability to implement countercyclicalcapital raising with rapid rights offeringsbanks and possibly other companies would be aidedby having the ability to effect rights offerings at amoments notice regulations should facilitate suchofferings  with the proper disclosure  in a matter ofdays rather than weeks this would allow a companyto raise capital and repair a balance sheet that mighthave been stretched by unanticipated market eventsand to do so in a manner that is fair and does notdilute the companys existing shareholder baseh the need for policies in health care pensionsenergy and the environment infrastructure andeducation that will serve

management team is deeply engaged and is actingwith extreme caution in navigating these unchartedwaters the us treasury and the federal reserve havecontinued to take bold and dramatic action as havecentral banks and governments around the world inthis next section we will discuss some of the importantissues for jpmorgan chasea our leadership in mortgage modifications andsupport for the administrations mortgage programsjpmorgan chase is at the forefront of foreclosure preventionand mortgage modifications nationally ourforeclosure prevention efforts are intended to reachboth the  billion of loans that we own and the trillion of investorowned loans that we servicewe already have helped keep  borrowers intheir homes and expect to help avert  foreclosuresby the end of  we are committed tokeeping borrowers in their homes by making sustainableproperly written loan modifications in manycases before a default occurswe believe it is in the best interests of both the homeownerand the mortgageholder to take correctiveaction as soon as possible our redefault rates are halfthe rates that the occ has said are experienced bynational servicers redefault rates in the industrygenerally will come down once modifications aredone with proper underwriting and as the economyand home prices start to improve if redefault rateswere extremely low we probably should be doingmore modificationswe strongly support the obama administrationsmortgage modification program the plans featuresare aligned with the program we already had implementedextending them to more struggling homeownersand providing us and other servicers with moreoptions to keep families in their homes we also supportthe program because the guidelines establish aclear fair and consistent set of standards for all servicersto follow it is intended for borrowers withmortgages below  and all borrowers mustfully document their income clearly demonstratefinancial hardship and live in the home we believe these mortgage modifications are economicallyand morally the right thing to do and that the programunderscores the importance of mutual respect  bytreating others in the way that we would like to be treatedin the same situation  while upholding the essentialprinciple that individuals businesses and corporationsshould repay their loans if they can afford to do so inour view its completeness eliminates the need for judicialmodification in bankruptcy proceedings howeverif legislated judicial modifications should be consistentwith this plan and focus only on borrowers who eitherdont qualify or have not been offered a modificationbeyond that it is time to quickly implement the mortgagemodification program  even if it is not perfect ineveryones view  and to move onb comments on the derivatives businessderivatives have become an essential and widely usedrisk management tool the international swaps andderivatives association estimates that  of thefortune   of midsized companies and thousandsof other smaller us companies use derivativesto manage certain risks including currency and interestrate risk as such derivatives are a large business forjpmorgan chase and for firms around the world it isimportant to note that derivatives in and of themselvesdid not cause this crisis in fact derivatives have performedfairly well in this crisis environment howeverit is clear that derivatives at least in financial reportingare hard to understand lack transparency and did contributesomewhat to the crisis at jpmorgan chase webelieve derivatives when used properly play an importantrole in managing risk and we are trying to addressthe concerns about derivatives we have been standard setters in bringing moretransparency to our financial reporting and willcontinue to be in this report you will find extensivedetails on our counterparty exposures and other riskconsiderations that are central to understanding ourderivatives and other trading businesses some of the concerns about derivatives have to dowith the large notional amounts but those figuresare reference measurements and do not reflect actual counterparty credit risk actual risk is the marktomarket value of the contract after taking intoaccount netting of risk across all transactions witha counterparty collateral and hedging actual riskprojections also take into account the potentialfuture exposure coming from market moves our counterparty exposures net of collateral andhedges are  billion and the company managesthose exposures name by name  like a hawk thefigure is large but we get paid to take the risks wereserve and account for them conservatively and wemanage them in conjunction with all of our othercredit exposures as the overall amount of counterparty credit riskhas grown so has the concern that this growth hasincreased systemic risk to address this issue wesupport the development of clearinghouses whichwe believe will reduce the counterparty risk andincrease transparency for standardized contracts wealready clear a significant portion of our interest rateand commodities derivatives through clearinghousesand we have been active in the development of aclearinghouse for credit default swaps those derivativesthat are too customized to be cleared can easilybe monitored by regulators to ensure they do notcause systemic risk aigs downfall wasnt due to its use of derivativesper se but to its poor risk management practicesthe insurer took concentrated risks through creditdefault swaps insuring mortgagerelated assets onthe other side of the equation some dealers boughtthis insurance from aig without requiring them topost collateral until such time as their credit ratingdeteriorated this is a case where bad risk managementon the part of aig was compounded by badcounterparty risk management by aigs counterpartiesthe potential systemic impact was substantialjpmorgan chase did business with aig but in linewith our general policies we kept our credit exposurerelatively small so that our firm would not becompromised if aig had been allowed to fail withhindsight the problem itself could have been bettercontained and dramatically mitigated had aig beenproperly regulated and required to provide collateralto a clearinghouse or its counterparties there are regulatory gaps that need serious attentionas was evident with aig a way to prevent afuture aig is by empowering a systemic risk regulatoras described earlier such a regulator wouldhave been in a position to see the risk piling up andaddress it before the company failed recognizing upfront profits for derivative transactionscan be problematic even though it is not standardaccounting we believe the profits relating tothe risk positions associated with derivatives shouldbe booked over the life of the transaction proportionateto the risk remainingwith proper management systemic risks created byderivatives can be dramatically reduced without compromisingthe ability of companies to use them inmanaging their exposuresc the reasons for maintaining a fortress balancesheet and cutting the dividendmaintaining a fortress balance sheet will always beessential to us our tier  ratio is  with tangiblecommon equity of  billion and we will continue toincrease our loan loss reserves as appropriate with billion in allowance for credit losses at the end of we believe our loan loss reserves across all ourbusinesses are among the strongest in the industryout of an abundance of caution to be prepared for thefuture during this uncertain environment we believedit was prudent to reduce our quarterly dividend from to  per share effective with our next scheduleddividend paymentwe did not take this action lightly and we recognizeour tremendous obligation to shareholders to seek tomaintain dividend levels but extraordinary timesrequire extraordinary measures so while our performanceand capital are solid we have an even higherobligation to ensure that our fortress balance sheetremains intact this will enable us to stay flexible toseize opportunities and continue to build and invest inour marketleading businesses even in a highlystressed environmentwe maintain a longterm commitment to the dividendand still view a  payout ratio of normalizedearnings as ultimately reasonable we will continueto review all relevant criteria to ensure the ongoingstrength of our capital base and will await a more stableeconomic environment before increasing the dividendd comments on tarpwhile the decision to reduce our dividend was notdirectly related to accepting tarp it does provide uswith additional capital  about  billion per year which could position us to repay tarp funds soonerthan otherwise would have been possible we of coursewould do this in consultation with our regulatorsmany people would like us to repay the tarp fundsas soon as we can some are angry over the changinggovernment conditions relating to the acceptance oftarp funds and some would like to see swift repaymentas a matter of principlethe reason we accepted tarp still stands  we believedit was in the best interests of the united states and thebanking system overall we will not react capriciouslyor out of anger in determining when to repay thetarp funds we will repay them only if doing so isconsistent with the best interests of our country andour companye the impact of a deep recession and thegovernments stress testwe have been forthright and consistent in letting ourshareholders know that a recession will impact ourfinancial results a severe recession even more so andthats if we do everything right last year we notedthat the recession would have a significant impacton credit and that in a difficult environment creditlosses could rise significantly by as much as  billionover time which would require increases in loan lossreserves managed net chargeoffs were  billion in up from  billion in  our current view isthat  chargeoffs will be even higherthe recession will ripple through and affect all of ourconsumer and commercial credit exposures  someworse than others in addition to higher chargeoffs itwill require substantial additions to reserves which wehave increased from  billion at the end of  to billion at the end of  we already said lastyear how bad we thought mortgage and home equitylosses might get and unfortunately they have becomeeven worse the severity of this recession also couldhave a dramatic impact on credit card losses we nowexpect a  unemployment rate to lead to chargeoffsof higher than  in the past we would expectunemployment of  to lead to chargeoffs of  ormore now however we believe that the combinedeffect of unemployment with the major housing downturnwill lead to a higher chargeoff ratethe treasury in conjunction with the occ fdic andfederal reserve has launched a stress test program toensure that the  largest banks those with more than billion in assets have the capacity to remainproperly capitalized in a highly stressed environmentthe governments adverse economic environmentenvisions a twoyear recession where unemploymentreaches  and the housing price index declines from peak to trough while some banks may needadditional capital or support a successful completionof the stress test program should eliminate the need toguess which banks are properly capitalized and whichare not in the best case it will affirm the banks capitalaccounting and reserve ratios which will removeuncertainty in the marketplace and increase financialstability unfortunately the announcement of thestress test which is expected to be presented in lateapril is causing enormous consternation in the marketsthat would have been better to avoidwe regularly do stress tests for our company alwaysprojecting forward our capital and liquidity we thinkour capital ratios will maintain their extremely stronglevels throughout the governments adverse economicenvironmentyou also should know that your company will beprepared for an environment even worse than the onejust describedf recent government actions and the potentialpower of concerted effortsgovernments around the world have taken dramaticactions during this crisis the federal reserve andtreasury of the united states have provided  trillionof liquidity facilities to finance various types ofassets and  to stabilize individual companies and theoverall system  have guaranteed almost  trillion ofassets on the balance sheets of certain institutionsand injected  trillion of capital into the financialsystem in addition the government is trying toreduce the mortgage rate by buying mortgagesmaking it easier to refinance reducing consumerpayments and aggressively pushing mortgagemodification programs we believe the recent termassetbacked securities loan facility or talfprogram which allows private investors to get nonrecoursefinancing on assetbacked securities willaid the securitization markets this program eventuallymay lend up to  trillion to finance new securitizedloans it can also be modified and extendedas appropriate it should be noted that many of thegovernments programs are not only replacing banklending but are also filling the gaps left by many ofthe nonbank lenders in the capital marketswe know that these government actions will haveunintended consequences and can lead to politicalinterference and that we will need to remove theseforms of support over time intelligently all theseconcerns add to our worries particularly about potentialfuture inflation but well reserve such a discussionfor another timethere is no silver bullet we believe that all of theseactions if implemented properly and executed  in atimely way and in conjunction with the us fiscalstimulus program  could have an enormous positiveimpact the sum of the parts can be a lot more powerfulthan each individual actionwe see that the largest global economic downturn isbeing met with massive global government actions and while the specific outcome is uncertain there isgood reason to think that the governments will eventuallywinthis country has had its defining moments the civilwar the great depression world war ii this mayalso be one of them president
