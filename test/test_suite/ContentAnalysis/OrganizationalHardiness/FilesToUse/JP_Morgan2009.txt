it was another difficult yearfor consumer lending with losses of billion driven by increased chargeoffs andadditions to loan loss reserves in our homelending portfolios as discussed last year theselosses were the result of departures from ourtraditional and welltested underwritingstandards sharply falling home prices and thedeepening recession while there has beensome improvement in delinquencies and homeprices in some markets we believe that significantimprovement will depend largely on animproving economyas expected chargeoffs in home lendingcontinued to rise during  and we added billion in reserves to our portfolio weanticipate that this portfolio will continue tolose money for the next three years excludingreserve changes as we work through abacklog of problem loans the losses comenot only from chargeoffs but from the costsof managing delinquencies and foreclosuresthough we were able to reduce the numberof homes that we own from  in to  in more positively we took

consumers and small businesseswe also issue cards with a number of partnerorganizations such as the american associationof retired persons aarp continentalairlines marriott southwest airlines unitedairlines and walt disneyhow we dealt with new regulationin  in addition to the terrible environmentthe us credit card business facedfairly dramatic changes because of a newlaw enacted by congress in may the newlaw restricts issuers ability to change ratesand prohibits certain practices that were notconsidered consumerfriendly these changesalone are expected to reduce our aftertaxincome by approximately  million to million  but this could possibly changeas both consumers and competitors changetheir behavior we believe that many but not all of thechanges made were completely appropriatein fact we had voluntarily eliminated certainof the targeted practices  like doublecyclebilling which resulted in greater interestcharges for customers who revolve a balancefor the first time  and universal defaultpricing in which creditors consider credithistories with other lenders in setting rates however because the new law makesit harder to raise rates on customers who havebecome far riskier and because all paymentsnow must go toward reducing users highest ratebalances vs lowerrate balances we andother competitors have had to make somefairly drastic changes in the business we have substantially reduced very lowintroductory or promotional balancetransfers this change alone reduced ouroutstanding balances by  billion in the future we no longer will be offeringcredit cards to approximately  of thecustomers to whom we currently offer themthis is mostly because we deem them toorisky in light of new regulations restrictingour ability to make adjustments over time asthe clients risk profile changes we reduced limits on credit lines and wecanceled credit cards for customers whohad not done business with us over anextended periodin fact the industry as a whole reduced limitsfrom a peak of  trillion to  trillionwhile we believe this was proper action toprotect both consumers and card issuers doingso in the midst of a recession did reduce asource of liquidity for some people ultimatelyhowever the change may make the card businessa more stable and better businesshow we intend to growaggressive product innovation is fundamentalto the

andshared understanding about the attributes wevalue most in senior managers these qualitiesmust be intentionally fostered and reinforcedthrough a rigorous talent assessment processthis process now is embedded as part of howwe operate we also are developing a generalmanagement program for mba students tohelp us add to our bench and build generalmanagement talent on an ongoing basisencouraging mobility and multiple careerstalent mobility and optimization are key to ourlongterm success we have to clearly outlinewhat people need to do to move to the nextlevel at jpmorgan chase we are working

dreams whileits also an individuals responsibility tomanage his or her own career its our job tohelp facilitate that we strive to be proactiveand thoughtful in that regardintense focus on successionwe need to be honest and thoughtful aboutpotential successors particularly for seniorjobs we have redoubled our efforts toensure that we have people in the pipelinewho are capable of assuming senior levels ofresponsibility three five or even seven yearsout or right away if necessary the hit by atruck emergency scenario this is true formy job as wellpoor ceo succession has destroyed many acompany ceo and management successionoften seems more like a psychological dramaor a shakespearean tragedy than the reasonedand mature process it should be it is in ourbest interest to avoid such dramai want to assure you our shareholders thatyour board believes that we have within theorganization some outstanding people whocould do my job today and we will continue torotate some of our senior people across the businessto ensure that others are fully developed totake my job in the future the board of directorsnot only believes that this is a priority butthat it is of the utmost importance and you canrest assured that your board members are onthe case they personally know all of the operatingcommittee members of the company andmany others and the board members periodicallyreview  with and without me  yourcompanys key succession plansgetting compensation rightcompensation is one of the most complexissues we confront  it is important to ouremployees our company our shareholdersand increasingly the public at large a poorlyconceived compensation strategy can devastatea company by attracting the wrong peopleand incenting them to do the wrong thingsfor the wrong reasons at jpmorgan chasewe put a great deal of time and thought intodesigning compensation plans that attractand motivate good people and reward goodbehavior of course compensation aside wealways expect our people to do the right thinga badly designed compensation plan never isan excuse for bad behaviormany people are concerned and angry aboutcompensation practices across the financialservices industry  and many of theseconcerns are quite legitimate senior leadersat some companies made a great deal of money while their companies failed and inthe process helped contribute to the crisis inour country this angers me too but not allcompanies were reckless  and not all companieshad bad compensation practicesin this section im going to describe how ouroverall  compensation related to otherindustries present some overall principlesthat guide us and explain how we apply theseprinciples in compensating our peoplecomparing jpmorgan chase with otherindustriesin  jpmorgan chases total expenses were billion the total compensation salariesand benefits and incentives your companypaid out was  billionas seen above we paid salaries and benefitsof approximately  per person andincentive compensation on average of per person for a total of  per personthese salary and benefit numbers are generallyin line with other major companies financial and nonfinancialthe incentive awards come in various formscash commissions restricted stock optionsetc approximately  of the incentivecompensation for  was in restricted stockand options that vest over a number of yearsat jpmorgan chase the use of stock optionsis very restricted  we only use stock optionsfor approximately  people a year  andrepresents just  of the companys totalcompensation expensemany commentators in an attempt to measurefairness and reasonableness of a companyscompensation payouts have looked at totalcompensation as a percentage of revenue onthis basis jpmorgan chases total compensationsalaries benefits and bonuses was for  this number averaged  overthe previous several years for our investmentbank alone  the part of the companyreceiving the most scrutiny  compensationwas  of revenue down from an averageof  over the last five yearsthe chart on the next page compares thesesame percentages with a wide mix of businessesfor the average us business totalcompensation as a percentage of revenue isapproximately  in general at businessesthat are peopleintensive and not capital orintellectual propertyintensive such as professionalservices companies a high percentageof the companys revenue is paid out to theemployees law firms for example whichare not included in the following table payout more than  of their revenue to theiremployees in highly capitalintensive companieslike telecommunications or certainmanufacturing companies payout ratios areconsiderably lowersome commentators also have looked at totalcompensation as a percent of profits here yousee a similarly wide range of resultsessentially the financial dynamics and structuresof various businesses are very differentand looking at these ratios always will producedivergent conclusions  they alone do notreveal very muchit also is important to point out that at manycompanies a significant amount of incentivecompensation generally is paid regardlessof whether or not the overall company doeswell many companies pay certain individualsbased on their specific performance sales andservice employees and not necessarily on theperformance of the companyjpmorgan chase does employ a number ofhighly compensated individuals probablymore than in many other industries  but not all we are unable to find real comparisonsmuch of the anger about highly compensatedindividuals at banks relates to the argumentthat all of these companies would have failedwhich we do not believe is true more detailon this in the next section finally the morehighly paid the individual is at jpmorganchase the higher the percentage of compensationawarded in restricted stock and optionsbefore we speak specifically about how wecompensate individuals at jpmorgan chaseits appropriate to outline our principlessome key compensation principles atjpmorgan chasewe believe the compensation principles weuse are best practices and compare favorablywith those outlined by outside authoritiessuch as the g the financial servicesauthority the financial stability board thefederal reserve and the us treasury ourprinciples are as follows pay a significant percentage of our incentivecompensation in stock at least  for theoperating committee members and approximately for the remainder of our seniormanagement team structure the stock we grant  restricted stockunits or options  to vest over multiple years require operating committee members toretain and hold approximately  of thestock they receive from the company afterthe stock vests generally do not provide multiyear guaranteesto new hires and almost never tocurrent employees institute meaningful recoupment policiessome of which we enhanced in  and and are progressively more stringentat higher levels of management forall employees if anyone causes materialfinancial or reputational harm to the firmor its business activities we can recoup theemployees incentives including stock for approximately  senior individualsunvested stock also can be recouped forfailure to properly identify raise or assess ina timely manner and as reasonably expectedmaterial risks to the firm for the operating committee and for meunvested stock or options can be recoupednot only for the reasons mentioned above butalso if reasonable progress toward personaland company goals is not met this is at thediscretion of the board of directors pay our people for performing well overmultiple years and for helping to buildenduring performance ensure that financial results  a key metricbut not the only one we use to pay ourpeople  always include profits adjustedfor risk that is the more capital a businessuses the more it is assessed a charge forthat capital recognize revenue for complex and long datedtrades or products over multiple yearsto properly reflect the risk try to be asconservative as possible regarding accounting aiming not to recognize profits at all whenwe think doing so is inappropriatesome of our other compensation principles gobeyond what regulators have asked for but webelieve are equally important for example we do not have changeofcontrol agreementsspecial executive retirement plans orgolden parachutes or special severance packagesfor senior executives we do not pay bonuses for completinga merger which we regard as part of thejob when the merger has proved to besuccessful compensation might go up we feel strongly that financial outcomesalone do not represent a comprehensivepicture of performance broader contributions such as continually honing leadershipskills maintaining integrity and compliancerecruiting and training a diverse outstandingworkforce building better systems andfostering innovation to name just someimportant qualities  matter a great deal infact in our business basing compensationsolely on financial or quantitative measuresand ignoring qualitative measures can bedisastrous good performance in a particularyear does not necessarily indicate that theindividual did a good job we are mindful that a rising tide lifts allboats so we take into account how much astrong market as opposed to the initiativeof the individual or group contributed tothe results we must be highly competitive on compensationwhich is absolutely crucial to beinga great company while we aim to be acompany that pays its employees well itshould be because we have been a wellperformingcompany we want our employees to be shareholdersall of the policies described above havebeen effective in this regard our employeesown  million shares and options asignificant portion of which is unvested ie of no value to the individual if he or shewere to leave the company for a competitorownership does not guarantee thatour employees will act like owners but itcertainly improves the oddshow we pay individualsour starting point when it comes to compensationis as it should be riskadjusted financialperformance we keep thousands of profitandlossstatements by branch by trading desk etcwhile we dont maintain incentive compensationpools at such a granular level we do havehundreds of such pools we try to maintain avery disciplined approach to relate compensationas closely as possible to performancehowever we do not stop there we makeadjustments based on our own judgmentsabout how the company is doing in absoluteand in competitive terms and for very specificbusiness decisions such as additions to staffor large new investments that affect profits insome cases the impact of these sorts of discretionaryfactors will be negligible in othercases the discretion we exercise may have asignificant effect on the size of an incentivecompensation pool if we feel the pool amountwas not earned we do not pay it some individuals are paid incentive compensationbased on very specific metrics forexample people in our call centers retailbranches and operating centers these metricsmay be increased or reduced somewhat bythe companys performance there also area few senior people who are paid on specificmetrics for example bankers who managemoney for our clients have their compensationtightly tied to the kind of job they did fortheir clients i think you would agree that thisis completely appropriatemost of our senior people are not paid byformula  we use multiple metrics to assessperformance and then apply a great deal ofjudgment in general the more senior theexecutive the more the compensation shouldrelate to the companys performance overallthis is especially true for the leadership teamof each businesswhen it comes to an individual we look at hisor her performance the unit results and theoverall performance of the company sincewe generally know these individuals well weevaluate their performance over a multiyearperiod it is important that we recognize ourbest people  many of those in senior positionshave generally proved themselves overmany many yearswe also are keenly aware of our competitionand know what it would take to replacea person if we had to hire someone new wecannot operate in a vacuumour most senior people  members of ouroperating committee  have their compensationtightly tied to the companys performanceand they also are evaluated on their leadershipskills in  when the companys earningswere down  your senior managementscompensation was down  this doesntinclude me i received no yearend incentivewe know there are people in this industrywho have been extraordinarily wellpaid  andin some cases overpaid some of these peoplehave benefited from profits that turned outto be ephemeral or were the result of excessiveleverage in the system some benefitedfrom extreme competition for their specifictalents often from hedge funds and othersuch businesses while no firm can claim itgets compensation right every time we atjpmorgan chase do think we have generallybeen disciplined when it comes to our decisionswe believe we have the right compensationpractices but that is only one part ofbuilding a great company the most importantpart is developing great leadersdeveloping leadersearlier in this section i mentioned that mynumber one priority is to put a healthy andproductive succession process in place as iwill be increasingly focused on this processi would like to share my thoughts about theessential qualities a leader must have particularlyas they relate to a large multinationalcorporation like jpmorgan chaseleadership is an honor a privilege and a deepobligation when leaders make mistakes a lotof people can get hurt being true to oneselfand avoiding selfdeception are as importantto a leader as having people to turn to forthoughtful unbiased advice i believe socialintelligence and emotional quotient oreq matter in management eq can includeempathy clarity of thought compassion andstrength of charactergood people want to work for good leadersbad leaders can drive out almost anyone whosgood because they are corrosive to an organizationand since many are manipulative anddeceptive it often is a challenge to find themand root them outat many of the best companies throughouthistory the constant creation of good leadersis what has enabled the organizations to standthe true test of greatness  the test of timebelow are some essential hallmarks of a goodleader while we cannot be great at all of thesetraits  i know im not  to be successful aleader needs to get most of them right disciplinethis means holding regular business reviewstalent reviews and team meetings andconstantly striving for improvement  fromhaving a strong work ethic to making lists anddoing real detailed followup leadership islike exercise the effect has to be sustained forit to do any goodfortitudethis attribute often is missing in leaders theyneed to have a fierce resolve to act it meansdriving change fighting bureaucracy and politicsand taking ownership and responsibilityhigh standardsabraham lincoln said things may cometo those who wait  but only the things leftby those who hustle leaders must set highstandards of performance all the time at adetailed level and with a real sense of urgencyleaders must compare themselves with thebest huge institutions have a tendency towardslowing things down which demands thatleaders push forward constantly true leadersmust set the highest standards of integrity those standards are not embedded in thebusiness but require conscious choices suchstandards demand that we treat customersand employees the way we would want to betreated ourselves or the way we would wantour own mother to be treatedability to face factsin a coldblooded honest way leaders emphasizethe negatives at management meetingsand focus on what can be improved of courseits okay to celebrate the successes too allreporting must be accurate and all relevantfacts must be reported with full disclosure andon one set of booksopennesssharing information all the time is vital we should debate the issues and alternativeapproaches not the facts the best leaders killbureaucracy  it can cripple an organization and watch for signs of politics like sidebarmeetings after the real meeting because peoplewouldnt speak their mind at the right timeequally important leaders get out in the fieldregularly so as not to lose touch anyone in ameeting should feel free to speak his or hermind without fear of offending anyone elsei once heard someone describe the importanceof having at least one truthteller at the tablewell if there is just one truthteller at thetable youre in trouble  everyone should bea truthtellersetup for successan effective leader makes sure all the rightpeople are in the room  from legal systemsand operations to human resources financeand risk its also necessary to set up the rightstructure when triheads report to coheadsall decisions become political  a setup forfailure not successmoralebuildinghigh morale is developed through fixingproblems dealing directly and honestly withissues earning respect and winning it doesnot come from overpaying people or deliveringsweet talk which permits the avoidanceof hard decision making and fosters passive aggressivebehaviorsloyalty meritocracy and teamworkwhile i deeply believe in loyalty it often ismisused loyalty should be to the principlesfor which someone stands and to the institutionloyalty to an individual frequently isanother form of cronyism leaders demand alot from their employees and should be loyalto them  but loyalty and mutual respect aretwoway streets loyalty to employees does notmean that a manager owes them a particularjob loyalty to employees means building ahealthy vibrant company telling them thetruth and giving them meaningful worktraining and opportunities if employees falldown we should get them the help they needmeritocracy and teamwork also are critical butfrequently misunderstood meritocracy meansputting the best person in the job whichpromotes a sense of justice in the organizationrather than the appearance of cynicism herethey go again taking care of their friendsfinally while teamwork is important and oftencode for getting along equally important isan individuals ability to have the courage tostand alone and do the right thingfair treatmentthe best leaders treat all people properly andrespectfully from clerks to ceo s everyoneneeds to help everyone else at the companybecause everyones collective purpose is to serveclients when strong leaders consider promotingpeople they pick those who are respected andask themselves would i want to work for himwould i want my kid to report to herhumilityleaders need to acknowledge those who camebefore them and helped shape the enterprise its not all their own doing theres a lot ofluck involved in anyones success and a littlehumility is important the overall goal mustbe to help build a great company  then wecan do more for our employees our customersand our communitiesthe grey area of leadershipthere are many aspects of the leadershipprocess that are open for interpretation thisgrey area contributes to the complexity of thechallenges that leaders  and those who governthem  face i would like to share with you wherei stand with regard to a few of these issuessuccessful leaders are hard to findthere are examples of individuals who havebeen thrust wholly unprepared into positionsof leadership and actually perform well i think of president harry truman amongothers i would submit however that relyingon luck is a risky proposition history showsthat bad or inexperienced leaders can producedisastrous results while there are possiblyinnate and genetic parts of leadership perhapsbroad intelligence and natural energy otherparts are deeply embedded in the internalvalues of an individual for example workethic integrity knowledge and good judgmentmany leaders have worked their entire lives toget where they are and while perhaps someachieved their stature through accident orpolitics that is not true for most anyone on asports team in government or in virtually anyother endeavor knows when he or she encountersthe rare combination of emotional skillintegrity and knowledge that makes a leadersuccessful leaders are working to build somethingmost leaders i know are working to buildsomething of which they can be proud theyusually work hard not because they mustbut because they want to do so they set highstandards because as long as leaders are goingto do something they are going to do the bestthey can they believe in things larger thanthemselves and the highest obligation is tothe team or the organization leaders demandloyalty not to themselves but to the cause forwhich they standnonetheless compensation does matterwhile i agree that money should not be theprimary motivation for leaders it is notrealistic to say that compensation should notcount at any level people have responsibilitiesto themselves and to their families theyalso have a deep sense of compensationjustice which means they often are upsetwhen they feel they are not fairly compensatedagainst peers both within and outsidethe company there are markets for talentjust like products and a company must pay areasonable price to competebig business needs entrepreneurs toothe popular perception is that entrepreneurs those who believe in free enterprise  existonly in small companies and that entrepreneursin small companies should be free topursue happiness or monetary gain as appropriatefree enterprise entrepreneurship andthe pursuit of happiness also exist in mostlarge enterprises and you our shareholdersshould insist on it without the capacity toinnovate respond to new and rapidly changingmarkets and anticipate enormous challengeslarge companies would cease to exist thepeople who achieve these objectives want tobe compensated fairly just as they would be ifthey had built a successful startup performance isnt always easy to judgemanagers responsible for businesses mustnecessarily evaluate individuals along a spectrumof factors did these individuals act withintegrity did they hire and train good peopledid they build the systems and products thatwill strengthen the company not just in thecurrent year but in future years did theydevelop real management teams in essenceare they building something with sustainablelongterm value making these determinationsrequires courage and judgmentsometimes leaders should be supported and paideven when a unit does poorlyif a companys largest and perhaps mostimportant business unit is under enormousstress and strain unlikely to earn moneyregardless of who is running it a managermight ask his best leader to take on the jobthis may be the toughest job in the companyone that will take years to work through beforethe ship has been righted when the managerasks a leader to take on the responsibilityshe quite appropriately will want to knowwhether she will be supported in the toughestof times will you make sure the organizationdoesnt desert me will you stop the politicsof people using my units poor performanceagainst me will you compensate me fairlymy answer to all of these questions would beyes and as long as i thought she were doingthe job well i would want to pay her like ourbest leaders profits aside conversely we allknow that a rising tide lifts all boats whenthats the case paying that leader too much ispossibly the worst thing one can do  becauseit teaches people the wrong lessonevaluating the ceothe ceo should be held strictly accountableby the board of directors the board shouldcontinually review the ceos performanceand give feedback and coaching the boardalone should determine the compensation forthe ceo at every regularly scheduled boardmeeting at jpmorgan chase the directors alsohave a private meeting without me compensationcommittees and the board need to beindependent thinkers  and yours are theyreview lots of data to evaluate the performanceof the company including reviewing competitorsperformance and their compensationpractices our board members do not rely oncompensation consultants to make decisionsfor them the board members believe thatdetermining how to compensate the ceo andall of our senior management is their responsibilityand cannot be outsourcedin two of the last  years i received no bonuswhich i thought was absolutely appropriate in bank one was in terrible shape  we hadto lay off approximately  people and ithought it completely inappropriate that i takea bonus that year my first at bank one i hada guarantee  i gave it up the second timewas in  and our financial results were justtoo mediocre to contemplate a bonus for theceo since we did pay many other people inthose two years we also lived by the principlethat the ceo does not have to be the highestpaid person in the companyin all the years ive worked at this companymuch of my compensation approximately has been in stock ive never sold a shareand do not intend to do so as long as im in thisjob in fact when i joined bank one i boughta lot of stock outright not because i thought itwas cheap in fact i thought it was overvaluedbut because i wanted to be tethered tightly tothe company and its performance we need rational policies based on facts andanalysisthe recent financial crisis has caused greatdistress across the country and around theworld but it also has provided us with a pathfor going forward the era of bailouts mustend and the oversight of systemwide riskmust increase among other changes davidhume said reason is  slave of the passions but if we rewrite the rules for banks outof anger or populism well end up with thewrong solutions and put barriers in the wayof future economic growth good policy andfinancial reform must be based on facts andanalysis and need to be comprehensive coordinatedconsistent and relevantas new york times columnist thomas lfriedman noted earlier this year we need anew banking regulatory regime that reducesrecklessness without reducing risktakingwhich is the key to capitalism in strikingthis regulatory balance the details matter weshould focus on building good regulation  notsimply more or less of it the last thing weneed is to enact new policies that overregulateand work at crosspurposes without reducingsystemwide risk none of us can afford thecosts of unnecessary or bad regulationwhile we acknowledge that making gooddecisions takes time we think it is importantto complete financial reform this year thelack of regulatory clarity is creating problemsfor banks and for the entire economy businessesneed confidence and certainty to growand to create jobs passing sensible financialreforms will provide some of the certaintythe business sector needs with this in mindi would like to discuss the critical lessonslearned and how they are central to gettingregulatory reform rightthe crisis had many causesin my  letter to shareholders i discussedthe fundamental causes and contributors tothe financial crisis i wont repeat them indetail here but broadly speaking they wereas follows the burst of a major housing bubble causedby bad mortgage underwriting a somewhatunregulated mortgage business and somemisguided government policies excessive pervasive leverage across thesystem including banks investment bankshedge funds consumers and the shadowbanking system the dramatic growth of structural risks andthe unanticipated damage they caused theflaws of money market funds and the reposystem remember we had a run on thecapital markets regulatory lapses and mistakes basel capitalrules that required too little capital anddidnt account for liquidity and relied toomuch on rating agencies the securities andexchange commission allowing us investmentbanks to get too leveraged and poorregulation of fannie mae and freddie macamong many elements of an archaic siloedregulatory system however we should notand do not blame regulators for the failuresof individual companies ever  managementis solely to blame the procyclical nature of virtually allpolicies actions and events eg loan lossreserving capital requirements and themarket itself the impact of huge trade and financingimbalances on interest rates consumptionand speculation levels the heart of the problem  across all sectors was bad risk management many marketparticipants improperly used valueatriskvar measurements they did not run stresstests to be prepared for the possibility of ahighly stressed environment they excessivelyrelied on rating agencies they stretched toomuch for current earnings and they didntreact quickly when markets got badat jpmorgan chase we never overly relied onvar and we regularly ran stress tests to makesure we were prepared for bad environmentsour goal was and is to remain profitableevery quarterwhile it is tempting to identify a scapegoat banks businesses the government orconsumers  it is pretty obvious that no onewas solely to blame and that no one should becompletely absolved from blameyes we made mistakes  and we have identified and described themin great detail in prior years chairmans lettersour two largest mistakes were making toomany leveraged loans and lowering our mortgageunderwriting standards while our mortgageunderwriting was considerably betterthan many others we did underwrite somehigh loantovalue mortgages based on statednot verified income we accept completeresponsibility for any and all mistakes wemade or may have madethere also are many mistakes that we did notmake among them structured investmentvehicles sivs extreme leverage excessivereliance on shortterm funding collateralizeddebt obligations and improper management ofour derivatives booksome of the mistakes we made may havecontributed to the crisis for those of coursewe are sorry  to both the public and ourshareholders however it would be a hugestretch to say that these mistakes caused thecrisis in fact at the height of the crisis weaggressively took actions that we believedhelped mitigate some of the fallout from thecrisis and contributed to the stabilization andrecovery eg our purchase of bear stearnsand wamu and our interbank lending that isloans that banks make directly to each otheryes we should thank the government for itsextraordinary actionsas noted in last years letter we think thegovernment acted boldly and urgently indealing with a complex and rapidly changingsituation without many of these actions webelieve the outcome could have been muchworse a great number of the actions that thetreasury and the federal reserve took directlyand indirectly benefited a number of institutionsand may have saved many from failureand bankruptcywithout these actions however not all bankswould have failedthe premise that all banks would have failedhad it not been for the governments actionsis incorrect this premise is behind much ofthe anger toward banks and some of the policyrecommendations that are meant to punishbanks we should acknowledge that the worstoffenders among financial companies nolonger are in existence and while it is truethat some of the surviving banks would not ormight not have survived not all banks wouldhave failed i know i speak for a number ofbanks when i say that some of us acceptedthe troubled asset relief program tarpcapital not because we needed it to survive butbecause we believed we were doing the rightthing to help the country and the economywe were told the government wanted eventhe healthy banks to take tarp to set anexample for all banks and to make it easier forthe weaker institutions to accept the capitalwithout being stigmatized jpmorgan chaseand many other banks were in a position to tryto help and that is what we did at the worst point in the crisis weaggressively provided creditthroughout the financial crisis jpmorganchase never posted a quarterly loss we servedas a safe haven for depositors worked closelywith the federal government and remained anactive lenderour fortress balance sheet enabled us to buybear stearns in march  adding billion in assets then we acquired washingtonmutual just six months later adding a further billion of assets through it all jpmorganchase absorbed the stress of higher consumerand wholesale credit losses while maintaininghigh liquidity and acceptable growth in ourcapital we acquired washington mutual just days after lehman brothers collapse onseptember   and in order to maintainour fortress balance sheet immediately sold billion in common stock the followingmorning the takeover of bear stearns andwamu provided essential credit and supportto the system and minimized a potentiallydisastrous disruption that could have resultedfrom their failures in the several monthsafter lehmans failure our interbank lendinggrew from almost nothing to as high as billion and our average lending was approximately billion per month even higherthan it had been in the prior months we alsopurchased at one point a net  billion ofsecurities which helped facilitate muchneededliquidity in the marketplacewe consistently maintained extremelyhigh capital levelsas the chart below shows we ended  withtier  common capital of  the criticalmeasure used by the federal reserve for itsbank stress tests and we ended  withtier  common capital of in may  the us government ran a stresstest on  banks the test assumed an adverseenvironment of  unemployment and a peaktotrough decline in the housing priceindex across a twoyear time span upon completionof the test the results required  banksto raise common equity to maintain  tier common capital through the end of the stressscenarios under the governments test jpmorganchase always had common equity of  billionin excess of the  minimum for the recordthe  billion of tarp capital we accepted waspreferred stock and therefore never was partof this calculation the bottom line is that wepassed the stress test with flying colorswe kept our liquidity extremely highas we entered the most tumultuous financialmarkets since the great depression we experiencedthe opposite of a run on the bankas deposits flowed in in a twomonth period billion flowed in  we barely knew whatto do with it at jpmorgan chase our depositsalways exceeded our loans deposits alwayshave been considered one of the safest sourcesof funding for a bank the average bank hasloans that are generally greater than  ofits deposits for jpmorgan chase loans wereapproximately  of deposits in fact ourexcess deposits greatly reduced the need tofinance ourselves in riskier wholesale marketsin the longterm wholesale unsecured marketswe borrowed on average  billion only billion was borrowed unsecured in the shorttermcredit markets  an extraordinarily lowamount for a company of our size when weborrow in the secured markets we do so underthe assumption that we would have access tosome not all of that funding in a crisiswe always maintained excess liquidity at thebank holding company we had and continue tohave enough cash or cash equivalents on handto fund ourselves for more than two years evenin the event that we are unable to borrow fromthe unsecured credit markets at allwe were prepared for things to get even worsewhile the economic environment had becomeas bad as any of us had ever seen we reluctantlyprepared for the situation to get worsewith a possible us unemployment rate of or higher such an adverse environmentwould have required drastic actions a largeheadcount reduction elimination of marketingand other investments and a decrease inlending to preserve capital steps like thesewould have saved more than  billion inexpenses and created considerable additionalcapital however it also would have imposeddeep hardship on many of our employeessuppliers and customers fortunately we neverhad to execute such a drastic plan this wasprecisely what the government was trying toavoid and i believe its actions helped preventmany companies from taking steps like thosementioned abovegovernment programs were a mixed blessingwhile we deeply appreciate the governmentsactions  and they clearly had benefits for thesystem and for jpmorgan chase  they alsowere a mixed blessingin june  we paid back the tarp capitalin full the  billion we borrowed for eightmonths cost us money because we never wereable to lend the  billion and earn a ratehigher than the  coupon we were paying onthe preferred shares in addition we gave thegovernment warrants worth almost  billion a direct cost to our shareholderswe did participate in the federal depositinsurance corporation fdic guaranteeprogram under which we issued  billion ofdebt with an fdic guarantee many banks thatused this program would not have had accessto the capital markets without this guaranteeand possibly could have failed for jpmorganchase it was not a question of access or need to the extent we needed it the markets alwayswere open to us  but the program did save usmoney as part of this program we have paidthe fdic  billion and after paying thefdic it will save us a significant amount ofmoney over the next few yearsour company was highly criticized foraccepting the tarp capital and for usingthe fdic program after april   eventhough we were eligible to continue using thefdic program we stopped using it therewere many other government programs withacronyms such as talf and ppip that webelieve were beneficial to the capital marketsbut that we did not need and chose not to useso as to avoid the stigma we did use the termauction facility taf a special governmentsponsoreddepository facility but this wasdone at the request of the federal reserve tohelp motivate others to use the systemwhile no one knows what would havehappened in the absence of all these governmentprograms there is a strong argumentthat those that entered the crisis in a positionof strength may have gathered huge benefitsat the expense of failing competitors  but it ishard to argue that this would have been goodfor the countrywe did not anticipate the anger or backlashthe acceptance of tarp capital would evokefrom the public politicians and the media but even with hindsight i think we wouldhave had to accept tarp capital because doingso was in the best interest of the country i dowish it would have been possible to distinguishbetween the healthy and unhealthy banks ina way that didnt damage the success of theprogram  so as not to create a situation wherethe public was left with the impression that allbanks were bailed out last i do regret havingused the fdic guarantee because we didntneed it and it just added to the argument thatall banks had been bailed out and fueled theanger directed toward banksthe government runs the fdic but the bankspay for itwhile the fdic is a government institutionthat insures bank deposits our shareholdersshould know that the costs associated withfailed banks are borne in full by the banksnot by taxpayers we think this is completelyappropriate even if the fdics special temporaryliquidity guarantee program tlgphad lost money those losses would have beencharged back to the surviving banks thereforeit is these surviving banks that have paidfor the cost to the fdic of the approximately bank failures since the beginning of of those failures the largest one wamu withassets exceeding  billion has cost thefdic nothing that is because jpmorgan chasebought wamu all of the other banks that havefailed were far smaller the next largest failurewas indymac with  billion all of thesefailures combined have cost the fdic an estimated billionbetween deposit insurance and tlgp fundingfor  and  plus estimates for ourshare of assessments over the next three yearsjpmorgan chase alone will have given thefdic a total of approximately  billion tocover the cost of failed banks banks are lending  a little less but moreresponsiblya great deal of media attention recently hasfocused on what it will take to get bankslending again the reality is that banksnever have stopped lending as of the endof february  according to the latest datafrom the regulatory reports total loans heldby commercial banks stood at  trillion higher than at the end of june  and morethan  higher than in how is it that businesses and consumersclearly feel they have less access to bank creditwhile the banks claim they are still lendingthis disconnect can be explained as follows t he flow of nonbank lending which hasaccounted for  of the credit suppliedin the united states dried up many nonbanklenders think of the shadow bankingsystem sivs the assetbacked commercialpaper market and the securitizationmarkets virtually collapsed these sourcesof credit alone  and they were funded byinsurance companies pension plans andcorporate and foreign investors  reducedthe credit they were providing to the systemby nearly half a trillion dollars bank lending did go up in the monthsimmediately after lehmans collapse butduring the course of  bank lendingstarted to decline in total while more than banks including jpmorgan chasestepped up and acquired failing banksthey could not and did not fully replace theextension of credit the failing banks hadbeen providing for example at jpmorganchase we did not continue the subprimelending and optionarm mortgages thatwamu had been providing m any banks also tightened their loan standardswhich further reduced new loans additionally customer demand for loansdecreased across large and small businessesin fact at jpmorgan chase alone loans tolarge companies dropped from  billionto  billion this was not due to ourreluctance to make the loans but ratherto large companies taking advantage ofthe ability to finance at lower rates in thereopened capital marketsbanks have a responsibility to make soundloans bad loans are one of the things thatgot us into this mess in the first place andunfortunately making good loans oftenmeans declining applications for loans thatdo not meet safe and sound lending criteriawhile it may not seem obvious at the timeturning down an application that fails tomeet these criteria actually may be in bothour and our clients best interest we have aresponsibility to lend only to those who canhandle the debt unlike many other businessesthis puts us in the unpopular positionof saying no to some of our customersbanks are not fighting regulationwe at jpmorgan chase and at other banks haveconsistently acknowledged the need for properregulatory reform and i also spoke about thistopic in great detail in last years letterlooking back one of the surprising aspectsabout the recent crisis is that most of thespecific problems associated with it globaltrade imbalances the housing bubble excessiveleverage money market funds etc wereindividually wellknown and discussed butno one as far as i know put together all of thefactors and predicted the toxic combination itwould become  and the crisis it would causeso what can we do to help fix the situationgoing forward we must focus on theproblem bad risk management this not onlycaused financial institutions to fail but it alsorevealed fundamental flaws in the systemitself these flaws existed at both a macro levelwhere the interplay of the numerous criticalfactors was missed and a micro level forexample the failure to prevent aig from takingexcessive onesided positions in trading derivativesand the failure to limit mortgages to familieswho could afford them and to keep loantovalueratios to a more reasonable over the last  years we have allowed ourregulatory system to become dangerouslyoutdated the structure is archaic and leaveshuge gaps in the system today in americabanks account for only onethird of the creditoutstanding with all kinds of nonbanks takingand trading risks and providing credit to thesystem so the idea that banking is confinedto depositholding entities is inaccurate anddeceptive the failure of so many firms ina range of sizes and categories  from bearstearns and lehman brothers to indymac andwamu to fannie mae freddie mac and aigas well as local community banks  proves thatregulation needs to be administered by productand economic substance not by legal entity wehave a chance to simplify and strengthen ourregulatory system and if we do it right it willnot only be able to handle the complex challengeswe face today but will be able to do so ina way that will be flexible enough to continuouslyadapt to our changing worldwe support a systemic regulatorgoing forward we will need a systemic regulatorcharged with effectively monitoring thespread and level of risk across the financialsystem in its entirety think of it as a superrisk regulator such a regulator would not eliminateall future problems but it would be able tomitigate them if we had eliminated just someof the problems it might have stopped the crisisfrom getting this bad congress appears to bewell on its way to creating just such a regulatorand we hope it succeedssome issues the systemic risk regulator shouldkeep in mind are the following focusing the process on managing risk thisshould not be a political process it shouldfunction like a strong risk managementcommittee eliminating gaps and overlaps in the systemfor example mortgages were regulatedby multiple entities some of which did aterrible job causing a race to the bottomas even good companies started to do badthings to maintain market share analyzing areas like the mortgage marketand other elements of the consumerfinancesystem to ensure that when new rules arewritten they create a sound safe effectiveand consumerfriendly mortgage market carefully tracking new products as theyoften are the source of many problems reviewing credit across the whole system including hidden extensions of credit suchas enhanced money market funds and sivs aggressively monitoring financial marketsand potential excesses or bubbles it may behard to detect bubbles and it may be inadvisableonce detected to exert a direct influenceon them with macro economic policyhowever it is appropriate to try to minimizethe collateral damage bubbles can cause italso would be appropriate to try to managebubbles not by using monetary policy but byrestricting credit on specific markets ie itwould have been appropriate to ask lendersto reduce loantovalue ratios in mortgagesor to minimize speculation in the financialmarkets by reducing the leverage used in therepo markets recognizing distortions as they develop inthe broader economy fiscal deficits tradeimbalances structural state budget deficitsand forcing policy bodies to anticipate theproblems that may result encouraging international coordination asmuch as possible  not only so companiescompete on a level playing field but alsobecause crises dont stop at national bordersthese are just some of the ways a systemicregulator could help fix the flaws in our regulatoryframework and create a system thatcontinually adapts and improves itself we support an enhanced resolutionauthority  and the elimination oftoo big to faileven if we achieve the primary goal of regulatingfinancial firms to prevent them fromfailing we still have to get government out ofthe business of rescuing poorly managed firmsall firms should be allowed to fail no matterhow big or interconnected they are to otherfirms thats why we at jpmorgan chase haveargued for an enhanced resolution authoritythat would let regulators wind down failingfirms in a controlled way that minimizesdamage to the economy and will never cost thetaxpayer anything fixing the too big to failproblem alone would go a long way towardsolving many of the issues at the heart of thecrisis just giving regulators this authority inand of itself would reduce the likelihood offailure as managements and boards wouldrecognize there is no safety net think of thisenhanced resolution as specialized bankruptcyfor financial companies the principlesof such a system would be as follows a failure should be based on a companysinability to finance itself the regulator or specialized bankruptcycourt should be able to terminate managementsand boards shareholders should be wiped out when abank fails  just like in a bankruptcy the regulator could operate the companyboth to minimize damage to the companyand to protect the resolution fund the regulator could liquidate assets or sellparts of the company as it sees fit unsecured creditors should recover moneyonly after everyone else is paid  like in abankruptcy in fact the resolution authorityshould keep a significant amount of therecovery to pay for its efforts and to fundfuture resolutions in essence secured creditors should betreated like they are treated in a bankruptcy the resolution fund should be paid forby the financial industry like the fdic istoday all institutions under this regime should livewith the exact same rules regulators should make sure that companieshave enough equity and unsecured debtto prevent the resolution fund from everrunning out of money to give an examplewhile lehman had  billion in equity italso had  billion in unsecured debt aresolution regulator in my opinion wouldclearly have been able to let lehman meetits obligations wind it down andor sell it offand still have plenty of money left over toreturn some money to the unsecured creditorshad this been done wisely the economywould have been better off if a firm fails there should be enough clarityabout the financial legal and tax structuresof that firm to allow regulators cooperatingacross international boundaries to wind itdown in a controlled manner  what somerefer to as living wills while there is no argument about whoshould pay for the resolution ie banks thereare some technical issues about how it shouldbe funded the resolution regulator does needto be able to fund these companies while theyare being wound down and there are plenty ofappropriate ways to accomplish thisonce it is established that any firm can failfirms of all sizes and shapes should be allowedto thrive it is wrong to assume that big firmsinherently are risky banks shouldnt be big forthe sake of being big but scale can create valuefor shareholders and for consumers who arebeneficiaries of better products that are deliveredmore quickly and less expensively thesebenefits extend beyond individuals to includebusinesses that are bank clients particularlythose that are global in scale and reach andthe economy as a whole banks capabilities size and diversityenabled them to withstand the crisisand emerge from it as stronger firms thisstrength in turn made it possible for manyfirms to acquire weaker firms at the governmentsrequest and help to alleviate potentialdamage to the economyclosing comments on regulationwhile we support the general principlesbehind enhanced regulation of derivativessecuritizations and enhanced consumer protectionswe do not support each and every partof what is being recommended the devil isin the details and it is critical that the reformsactually provide the important safeguardswithout unnecessarily disrupting the health ofthe overall financial systemwe also believe there are some serious ideasthat need attention if the system is to be mademore failsafe repo markets could be better structuredmonitored and controlled loan reserving could be made far lessprocyclical securitization markets could be fixed so thatboth originators and distributors have skinin the game a system could be put into place to preventa run on money market funds the ability to buy shareholder or creditorvoting rights without owning and beingexposed to the risks of owning the underlyingsecurities should be extremely limitedinvestors should not have the ability to votethe capital securities actually owned if theinvestors are voting for the failure of thecompany and stand to gain more on theirshort positions than on their long positions finally we support strong controls onsocalled naked short sellingduring the past years discussion among regulatorsand legislators many other ideas havebeen proposed or recommended  from thevolcker rule to new bank taxes to changes inbasel capital these ideas are all in varyingstages of development and are too undefinedto comment on here what we would urge ourregulators and legislators to do is proceed withclarity and purpose and avoid broadly penalizingall firms alike  regardless of whetherthey were reckless or prudent as we grapple with the enormity of the issuesfacing the nation we must not lose

and rules that foster us capitalaccumulation policies facilitating job growth as opposed tothose that inadvertently make it harder to hirecountries can have different social valuesand objectives though i believe most countriesand most citizens would like to reducepoverty and suffering but countries shouldnot confuse values and objectives with maintaininga strong economyhealthy and growing countries can dowonderful things for their people and countriesthat fail to create healthy economiesfrequently relegate their people to increasinglevels of pain and suffering many countrieshave professed wanting to help their peoplebut instead have damaged their countries andhurt their people maybe the intentions werereal but even if they were the road to hell isoften paved with good intentionsbrazil is an example of a country that seemsto be successfully using progrowth policiesto expand its economy while using thewealth from that economic growth to financeimportant social programs over the last years brazil has adopted many policies thatdramatically strengthened its economy italso bolstered its institutions privatized itsbusinesses improved the rule of law left thebulk of capital allocation to the private capitalmarkets and developed worldclass companies eight years ago brazil elected a leftleaningpresident but he continued policies tostrengthen the economy he also used someof the wealth to start a program called bolsafamilia that gave brazils poorest citizens vaccinationseducation and  a month for foodthe lesson is clear good policies andeconomic growth are not

partners with largeenough balance sheets to finance transactionsaround the world and its not just multinationalcorporations that rely on such scalestates and municipalities also depend onthe capital that a firm like jpmorgan chasecan provide to be sure smaller banks play avital role in our nations economy but cannotalways provide the type of service capitalbreadth of products and speed of

transactions to offer a range ofproducts and services from loan underwritingand risk management to local lines of creditto process terabytes of financial data and toprovide financing in the billionsus banks actually are less consolidated thanthose in the rest of the world and our financialsystem is less dominated by large banks thanthat of almost any other nation for example in the three largest us banks held  oftotal us bank assets  the secondlowest figureamong organisation for economic cooperationand development oecd nations just aheadof luxembourg the average for the rest of theoecd nations was more than double at not only is our banking system not particularlyconcentrated but our large banks are notrelatively large compared with the size of theus economy the arguments that big is badand that too consolidated is bad are refuted bymany examples of countries with large consolidatedbanking systems that did not have problemsat all eg canadacapping the size of americas largest bankswont change the needs of big business insteadit will force these companies to turn to foreignbanks that wont face the same restrictionsjpmorgan chases capabilities size and diversitywere essential to withstanding the financialcrisis in  and emerging as a stronger firmeveryone needs to be responsibleamerica was built on the principles of ruggedindividualism and selfresponsibility we needto continue to foster a sense of responsibility inall participants in the economy bad outcomesare not always someone elses fault  we needto cultivate an environment where consumerslenders borrowers businesses and investors alltake responsibility for their actions and dontlook for someone else to blame we have to stopslipping into a cacophony of fingerpointingand blame and while bad actors always shouldbe punished we also should note that not allwho got into trouble were irresponsible wefully acknowledge for example that many individualsfound themselves in a difficult positionthat was caused by a medical condition or lossof employment beyond their control and theyshould be treated fairly and respectfullythe crisis of the past couple of years has hadfarreaching consequences among them thedeclining public image of banks and bankers while jpmorgan chase certainly made itsshare of mistakes in this tumultuous timeour firm always has remained focused on thefundamentals of banking and the part we canplay to support our clients and communitiesour  people go to work every day to doa great job serving clients whose trust we haveto earn over many years the vast majority ofour people customers operations and shareholdersare far from wall street  they actuallyare part of the everyday life of main street invirtually every part of the country and theyare active and contributing members of societyin communities around the worldvery often when the public or politicianstake punitive efforts against banks like oursthey think they are punishing only the seniormanagement team when in fact they arepunishing ordinary shareholders as wellcontrary to popular perception main streetowns our biggest banks and corporationsthrough savings and retirement funds ourshareholders represent a true cross section ofamerica including teachers retirees and publicemployees when we reduce the debate overresponsibility and regulation to simplistic andinaccurate notions such as main street vs wallstreet big business vs small business or bigbanks vs small banks we are indiscriminatelyblaming the good and the bad  this is simplyanother form of ignorance and prejudiceby extension when we vilify whole industriesor all of the business community we are denigratingourselves and much of what made thiscountry successful we also should refrain fromindiscriminate blame of any whole group ofpeople including politicians or the media weneed to focus a bit less on daily media and pollsand more on the books that will be written afterthis crisis subsides we all should ask ourselveswhether we in a time of stress did the rightthings the right way for the right reasonsconclusionthe united states faces many challenges inthe short run overcoming this economic crisisand getting our unemployed back to workare most important in the long run we mustconfront our health and education systemsdevelop a real substantive energy policyand build the infrastructure for the futurewe also must confront the large us deficitbeing honest about the facts and being fiscallyresponsible for ourselves  it is dangerous towait for the global markets to pressure us intothat discipline these are all serious challengesbut if we work together we can fix themyour company continues to do everything itcan in every community in which we work tohelp the world recover as quickly as possiblein  as
