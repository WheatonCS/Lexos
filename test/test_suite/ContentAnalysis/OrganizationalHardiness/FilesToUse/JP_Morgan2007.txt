as i write this letter the turbulence that began in the second half of continues to wreak havoc on the financial markets today giventhe magnitude and unprecedented nature of events as they continue tounfold it is a year that will be written about for a long time we do notknow when this cycle will end or the extent of the damage it will causebut we do know that no financial company operating under theseconditions will emerge from them unchanged and while we are longtermoptimists about the future of the us economy and our companywe remain focused on the current crisis in this context i will reviewhow we performed in  and how we are preparing to weather theongoing stormi would like to start by saying how gratifying it is that jpmorgan chase wasable to report record revenue and earnings for  despite the intensecredit and capital markets issues we faced during the second half of theyear these issues continue to confront us today particularly in both ourinvestment bank and home lending businesses that said we must beprepared for a severe economic downturn that could affect all of ourbusinesses we intend to navigate through the turbulence protect ourcompany and capitalize on any opportunities that present themselvesit is during these tough times that we can distinguish ourselves with ourclients as a firm we have a history of showing leadership during timesof financial crisis and we will continue to build on that legacyas you read this letter i hope you will agree that our expectations arerational our approach is consistent and measured and our operatingphilosophy is sound i also hope you will feel as i do  that while ourcompany still faces many risks in these challenging times we willcontinue to grow our franchise outperform many of our competitorsand win where it matters most with customers in the marketplace i review of over the past few years we have not only worked hardto instill management discipline but we have also spentconsiderable time and resources developing a strongfoundation for longterm growth so when we measureour performance we not only review financial results by line of business and for the company overall  butwe also look at multiple indicators of health these measureshelp us gauge the progress we have made by expandingand extending our capabilities geographic reachclient coverage product offerings and technology andby attracting training and retaining talented peoplemeaningful progress in any of the areas mentioned abovetakes a considerable investment of time and moneywe generate both

borrowers in their homes through our charitablesupport and in helping to develop strong publicpolicies we are determined to materially enhance ourefforts in this area  whether its through working withgovernments notforprofits or other community organizationswe have much more to say about the work we aredoing in this area which we will express in a detailedreport on corporate responsibility over the coming monthsc operating efficiency and capital strengthour  progress with regard to these two priorities isreviewed belowwe continued to boost efforts to increase operatingefficiency and reinvest in the businessmany of the investments described in the previous sectionwere funded by cost savings by eliminating waste we werenot only able to run a more efficient and effective companybut we were also able to invest more where it countsmost for example over the course of  we shed million square feet of excess real estate globally since we have shed  million square feet of excess spaceeliminating this excess real estate has enabled us to becomemore not less accessible to our customers in  theseredeployed savings were used to develop new branchesinternational presence and electronic capabilities we willstay vigilant to reduce unnecessary expenses and invest inareas that will also make us stronger down the roadwe remained disciplined and committed to preserving afortress balance sheetwe operate in risky businesses and having a fortress balancesheet is a strategic imperative not a philosophical bent it isalso a critical differentiator for us  especially in uncertaintimes we achieved it through the following elements appropriately conservative accounting strong loan loss reserves diligent review of all assets and liabilities on and offour balance sheet disciplined reporting and regular reviews across ourbusinesses a detailed and deep understanding of  and constantfocus on  the margins and returns of each businessoften at the product level recognition of market cyclicality and continuousanalysis of our own businesses so that we deliver solidreturns through the cycle  not just in good times we maintained strength to operate in any environment by sustaining a strong capital ratio whether measuredby tier  capital we had  or tangible commonequity to assets we had a ratio of  under the newbasel ii capital rules we expect our tier  capital ratiowould be even stronger than we report today capitalizing on favorable market conditions early in to prefund a substantial amount of our companysneed for capital and longterm debt this gave usflexibility when evaluating financing alternatives duringthe second half of the year maintaining and continuing to maintain extremelyhigh liquidity this means that your company currentlyhas on average a range of  billion to  billion inovernight investments this has served us well underthe current market conditions increasing our dividend by  from the previous year for the first time in six years we believe that payingout  of earnings as dividends is generally theappropriate amount repurchasing approximately  billion of our stockbecause we believe it is a good investment and is consistentwith our capital needs to give us more flexibilityas we entered a turbulent time however we essentiallystopped buying back stock in the third and fourthquarters of last yearwe avoided seeking expensive capital from outside sourceswe continually stress test our capital and liquidity needs tosimplify what we essentially try to do is stay properly capitalizedat current levels even if called to fund up to  billionof cash needs for our clients or for the corporation wethink these are conservative if not worstcase assumptionsbut if the environment trends more negative we think ourtier  ratio would remain very strong particularly relative toour peers in this type of scenario our goal is to continueserving our clients and building our business without beingpressured to seek expensive equity or debt capital elsewherewe used our strong foundation to further our objectivesnot only did our strong balance sheet and liquidityallow us to sleep better at night but it also made itpossible for us to support our clients by fulfilling their capital requirementsprudently with credit  especially as the marketsbegan to deteriorate in the latter half of  build our business for example we took advantage ofwhat we believed was an opportune time to strengthenour presence in the mortgage business prepare ourselves to take advantage of emergingopportunities which could include buying good assetsat a reasonable price or evaluating other strategicacquisitions that make sense for our shareholdersii key issues and lessons of in the fall of  my daughter called and asked medad what is a financial crisis i answered her by sayingwithout intending to be funny its something thathappens every five to  years she then asked sowhy is everyone so surprisedthe united states and the world have in fact hadvarious financial crises every five to seven years probablyfor as long as financial history has been recorded inrecent times there was the recession of  the stockmarket crash of  the savingsandloan and commercialreal estate crisis of  the market panic of brought about by the long term capitalmanagement and emergingmarket crises finally in the internet bubble burst knocking the stockmarket down looking at all of these crises some attributes were differentbut many were the same the triggering event in was the bursting of the housing bubble and therelated bad mortgage underwriting standards in the years from  housing prices in the us rose far exceeding normal home price increases and outstrippingtraditional measures of affordability while somethought the gains were justifiable it is clear now that theywere not as of today housing prices nationally are downon average almost  since the end of  and itlooks as if they will continue to deteriorate it is also clearin hindsight that increasingly poor underwriting standardseg loantovalue ratios up to  lax verificationof income and inflated appraisals added fuel to thespeculation and froth in the markets many of these poormortgage products were also repackaged and dispersedwidely through various securities thus distributing theproblems more broadlyas warren buffett says when the tide goes out youcan see whos swimming naked in this crisis as the tidewent out we saw subprime concerns first then mortgagerelatedcollateralized debt obligations cdos structuredinvestment vehicles sivs alta mortgages mortgagereal estate investment trusts reits the impact onmonolines and finally very unfortunately for us homeequity loans and the tide is still going outas this chapter of history continues to be written we cannothave the full benefit of hindsight however there aresome lessons we have already learned and others we candraw upon from past crises in the context of todays crisisthey are worth revisitinga issues and insights specific to the  financial crisiswe generally avoided many  but not all  of the issuesassociated with the storm of  lets talk about someof them in detailsivs served no business purposewe deliberately steered clear of most sivs because weviewed them as arbitrage vehicles with plenty of risk a limitedbusiness purpose and a flawed design we sold a smallsiv back in  we also minimized our financing tosivs for the same reasons sivs will probably disappear except for the few that demonstrate a sustainable businesspurpose  and the world will not miss them that said therewere two things related to sivs that did catch us by surprise their growth and its impact sivs had grown to a verylarge size as an industry segment  to approximately billion and they owned a substantial amount of mortgagesecurities cdos and bank securities their propensity to fund longdated and sometimesilliquid assets with shortterm commercial paper whenpeople started questioning the viability of sivs themarkets became unwilling to refinance their commercialpaper and therefore many of the sivs were forcedto liquidate their assets the banks and money marketfunds that were holding sivs commercial paper beganto experience stress of their own fortunately ourinvestment bank was not directly affected by this issuebecause we provided almost no backup credit facilitiesto sivs and our asset management group containedits exposure to sivs by limiting its investment to onlythe few highquality wellstructured sivssubprime mortgages and subprime cdos were moredangerous than we thoughtin  we thought we focused early on the subprimeissue  and in fact we addressed the subject at length inlast years shareholder letter we became increasingly vigilantin our underwriting and avoided underwriting loanswe were not comfortable holding to maturity even sowe still found ourselves having to tighten our underwritingof subprime mortgage loans six times through the end of yes this means our standards were not toughenough the first five times in last years letter we thoughtour losses could increase substantially from  levelsin fact we saw them go up from  million in  to million in  and we think they could significantlyelevate in  if economic conditions worsenwithin our investment bank we avoided large exposure tosubprime loans mostly by reducing our positions or activelyhedging them we also chose not to become a majorplayer in subprimerelated cdos even so we did losesubstantially more than we expected  billion on subprimemortgage and subprimerelated cdos although wegenerally treat offbalance sheet obligations like onbalancesheet obligations a large share of our losses came in certainoffbalance sheet transactions we will redouble our effortsto ensure that this does not happen againkeeping the above in mind we still believe that subprimemortgages are a good product when subprime loans areproperly underwritten they serve a meaningful purposethey can make a real difference to young families to thosewho experienced financial problems earlier in life to immigrantswith little credit history and to the selfemployedthese loans have helped many people achieve theamerican dream by buying homes they can afford whiletighter underwriting standards have now materiallyreduced our production of subprime mortgage loans wewill continue to find a prudent way to be in this businesshome equity deteriorated dramaticallyhome equity is important to our company we retain all ofour home equity production on our balance sheet and atthe end of  we had about  billion in our home equity portfolio the losses in this portfolio are increasingrapidly and rising at a higher rate than we ever could haveexpected even in a severe recession in  our netchargeoffs were  million and we added  billion toreserves in  we think chargeoffs in the first quartercould reach  million and possibly double by thefourth quarter as a function of the level of home pricedepreciation since loan loss reserves reflect expected lossesthis will require us to significantly increase these reservesthere will undoubtedly be more lessons to come as thedeterioration of the home equity business continues butthere are three lessons we have already learned the hard way we underestimated the size of the housing bubble and therapid rate of depreciation while we recognized the existenceof a housing bubble the rate and severity of thehousing price depreciation surprised us we also missedthe impact of increasingly aggressive underwritingstandards on housing price appreciation and increasedspeculation and froth in the market finally we did notsee that the ever rising housing prices over the yearperiod were masking potential losses when these lossescame into clear view as a result of the increasinglyaggressive underwriting standards much of the damagehad already been done we misjudged the impact of more aggressive underwritingstandards over many years loantovalue ltv ratioshad increased from  to  to  etc incomeverification became a less important part of the processand appraisals became overly optimistic these trendsled to far more aggressive underwriting while eachindividual change seemed reasonable at the time andlosses seemed to be contained we now know that wasa mirage multiple changes occurring over many yearshave essentially altered the nature of the productwe should have acted sooner and more substantially toreduce the ltv rates at which we lent given theincreased risk of falling prices in a market of highlyinflated housing values we also should have tightenedall other standards eg income verification in responseto growing speculation in the market and the increasingpropensity of people to respond to aggressive lendingstandards by buying houses they could barely afford we would have been better off had we imposed tightercontrols on the outside mortgage broker business we usedthe same underwriting guidelines for outside mortgagebrokers as we did for our own mortgage bankers inhindsight this was a mistake we wish we had appliedtighter standards to outside brokers losses attributableto outside brokers have always been two to three timesgreater than losses on mortgages we produce internallythat is the reason we closed the broker business atbank one we have now materially tightened standardsacross the board and our standards for outside brokersare even tighter although home equity productionthrough the broker channel decreased by as much as by the fourth quarter of  we believe thequality of underwriting has improved significantlythe home equity business seems to have fundamentallychanged from the way it was meant to be a means of conservativelygiving people access to cash from equity in theirhouse it has since evolved into a business that has allowedpeople to take leveraged bets on the assumption that thevalue of their home will increase when home equityreturns to its original purpose and practice it will be avery good business again for that reason we intend notonly to stay in it but to become the best in the businessleveraged lending had a tough year but it will continueto be part of our core businessin  we continued to hold the no market positionin global syndicated finance and highyield debt and weintend to maintain these top rankings leveraged lending isan activity that has long been  and will continue to be  acritically important way for us to serve our clients in totalover the last five years our syndicated leveraged financebusiness has generated average annual revenue of billion in  after taking losses of  billion net offees which makes us very unhappy this business stillgenerated  million in revenue we made some mistakesthis past year and weve learned the following we should have been more diligent when negotiating andstructuring commitment letters a few years ago commitmentsto fund future transactions were not reflected onour balance sheet until the details were finalized and thefinal binding letter was signed in the event of a materialchange in market conditions this practice providedlenders with the ability to make important amendmentsto the letter andor to the price at which it could besold over time however this flexibility disappearedbut we were still held to the original terms of thecommitment letters this meant that when the marketdeteriorated we still had to fund the transaction uponfunding instead of making an average fee of  to we lost  these commitment letters had essentiallybecome puts on the market that is if the markets werestrong things were fine but if the markets collapsed asthey did we would be stuck with the original price andcould lose a substantial amount of money this is a onesidedbet and one that subjects us to losses every timethe markets crash  an occurrence that is as inevitableas it is painful now having recognized the value ofthese puts we fully acknowledge the risks we are takingwhen we sign these letters we cannot allow ourselves to be pushed into positions thatare too risky we simply cannot follow the market likelemmings or allow ourselves to succumb to demands orpressures that compromise our credit standards and leadto bad decisions in every deal we do we must insist onfair treatment and adequate compensation for the risk weare asked to assume a lot of people with whom we dobusiness in leveraged finance are among the most sophisticatedcreative and tough businesspeople we know buttrue longterm partners understand that a healthy businessrelationship is a twoway street that must work forboth parties over a long period of time bad financialpractices like equity bridges or excessive leverage are notgood for us or ultimately for our partnersb lessons learned some old some newdifferent triggering events ignite each financial crisisonce under way however these crises have much in commonas they say history may not repeat but it rhymeshard lessons learned from past crises have relevance forus today lets revisit a number of them as followsmarkets can get very volatilefor years the financial industry had been the beneficiaryof relatively stable financial conditions from through the first half of  markets were fairly benignmaking it easier to get lulled into a false sense of securityand to lose sight of how risky the financial environmentcan be we must always remind ourselves that marketscan become volatile very quickly and when least expectedfor those traders who began their careers after the crisisof  it was especially hard to accept that spreads andprices could widen by  basis points in a matter of daysour responsibility as managers is to ensure at every levelof trading there exists a consistency in our approach anda deep respect for unpredictability of marketsthere is no substitute for good judgment and strong oversightrisk models are valuable tools but they have limitationsbecause they are backwardlooking by design they tendto miss certain factors the value of stress testing is alsoa function of time frame for example scenarios maybe compromised because the data may not go back farenough we use valueatrisk var and stress testing butthey are only part of what we consider good risk managementgood sound oldfashioned human judgment iscritical strong risk management entails constant reportingand review exposure by exposure and the ability to sizeup exposures instantly with the right systems managersmust know the tough questions to ask  especially withregard to stresstest loss scenarios  and have the ability tostay on top of all the important issues intense oversightby and informationsharing with managers is absolutelykey as is access to the expertise of independent pricingand valuation groups finally assumptions need to betested constantly that said we all know even when everythingis done right there still will be volatile results andmistakes but if things are not done correctly then theoutcomes can be disastrouswhen markets get volatile almost all risky assets repricethis is not a surprise  it has happened almost every timemarkets get volatilein difficult market conditions liquid assets become illiquidwhat happened to jumbo mortgages commercial mortgagebackedsecurities leveraged loans and cdos are examplesof this phenomenon and because financial companies haveassets that are no longer easily sold they are less willingto take additional risk in the marketplace this not onlycompounds the problem but it also creates a new problemskepticism about whether or not a company with illiquidassets can meet its shortterm obligationsproblems occur when there is too much shorttermfinancing funding longterm assetsthere is one financial commandment that cannot beviolated do not borrow short to invest long  particularlyagainst illiquid longterm assets as it turns out somehedge funds reits sivs cdos and certain financialinstitutions did exactly that in these kinds of marketswhen the value of shortterm investments is questionedsuch as money market funds or commercial paper a crisiscan easily ensue individuals acting rationally to protecttheir own interests race to sell securities but in aggregatethis process by market participants can easily take on a lifeof its own and escalate into a panica fortress balance sheet protects the franchiseas i mentioned earlier a fortress balance sheet is a strategicimperative  especially in turbulent market conditionslike these no matter what conditions are we always wantto have the capital liquidity reserves and overall strengthto be there for our clients and to continue investing wiselyin the businessirrational expectations impede quality growthsometimes theres so much pressure on companies toexpand their businesses that they end up pushing theirown people to grow grow grow often people feel thispressure most when market conditions are good but itis when markets turn bad that such pressure can lead todangerous outcomes for all businesses  and especially forvolatile businesses like investment banking that take risksstandards are reduced too many compromises are madeand theres a lack of focus on what is in the best interestof clients it is easy to grow a business when taking onadditional risk  but that is often the worst thing to dogrowth expectations need to be rational we know thereare times when we should not strive to grow certain areasof the business this is an operating philosophy thatprotects us from the costly consequences of bad growthrisk models that rationalize a lower level of capitalcontribute to poor judgmentto maximize the size of a potential risk position modelsare often designed to justify as little capital as possible forexample numerous triplea supersenior cdos drew littleregulatory capital and therefore looked safe with goodreturns that safety and those returns turned out to be anillusion this is why it is important for us to understand ourrisks inside and out and to maintain sufficient economiccapital against that risk we measure risk by how bad thingscould be  not how good they arefinancial turmoil increases the chance of recession  andthe specter of recession weighs heavily on the marketit is important to note that the turbulence weve experiencedoccurred in a good economy and while financialconditions have a serious impact on the global economythey do not  in and of themselves  necessarily cause arecession in fact many severe financial crises have notresulted in recessions that said the weaker the economygets the greater the impact could be across all our lines ofbusiness tight financial conditions eg the reduction ofcredit the outright removal of credit in certain marketsand the higher costs of credit make it harder and morecostly for individuals and companies to borrow moneyand therefore weaken the economyas these conditions worsen the possibility of a deep recessionincreases as the specter of a recession weighs moreheavily on the normal functioning of capital marketsso too does the fear about the possibility of a recessionwhy take additional risk when we might be in a recessioninvestors decide they dont want to take the risk so theymay remove money from banks commercial paper andmoney market funds in order to buy treasuries such areaction isnt necessarily unwise or inappropriate but itdoes help to create a selffulfilling prophesy i i i  on to  and looking forwardto in the summer of  we began to prepare for a downturnin the market while we have successfully weathered thestorm thus far we face new uncertainties every day despitethe continued turmoil we are encouraged to see many of theproblems resolving at a fairly decent pace yet while wehope the remaining issues will be sorted out expeditiouslyand a lengthy recession will be averted we cannot count onthis being the case we need to confront the possibility thattodays upheaval could result in serious market deteriorationthat the us has not experienced since  to prepare forthis possibility we need to have a clear sense of our risksa key potential riskswhat follows is a discussion of the risks that concern usmost and some of our thoughts about how to address themthere is still substantial risk on our balance sheetwe are generally comfortable with the values the hedgingand the loan reserves on our balance sheet but we alsorecognize that many of our positions while somewhathedged are still quite risky hedges by their very natureare imperfect we focus on this risk by viewing our assetson a gross basis relying solely upon a net basis implies thatit is not possible to lose money on both sides of a complextrade we know however that this is quite possiblesome of our largest exposures in the investment bank as ofyearend are listed below  billion in funded and unfunded leveraged loanswe have written these loans down by more than  butacknowledge that they could easily deteriorate more invalue however at current levels we believe they representa good longterm value so in early  we decidedto add  billion to the  billion of leveragedloans we were already holding as longterm investments  billion in commercial mortgagebacked exposurethe majority of this exposure is securities and loans activelycredithedged and riskmanaged  is triplea rated  billion in subprime mortgage and subprime cdorelatedexposure approximately  million of thisexposure is subprime cdo the remainder is comprisedof subprime loans residuals and bonds  billion in cdo warehouse and unsold positions are corporate loan underlying subprime is negligible  billion in alta mortgage exposure most are triplea securities and firstlien mortgages most of these exposures are markedtomarket daily whilethey can fluctuate considerably in value on a single day andcan dramatically affect any one quarters results we believemany of them now have decent longterm value it is alsoworth noting that our gross exposures are in general lowerthan those of most of our competitorsi have already discussed our subprime and home equityexposures with regard to our commercial bank an exposureworth bringing to your attention is the  billionin commercial real estate exposure this position is welldiversifiedand represents only  of our total commercialbank credit portfolio we have been very conservative ingrowing this exposure in recent years on a percentageand absolute basis it represents less than half the averageexposure of our commercial bank peersthe financial stability of some monoline bond insurersremains an issuesome market analysts believe there could be a downgradingof the monoline bond insurers  from their triplea ratingstatus to doublea status or worse  and possibly one ormore defaults our gross exposures to monolines are significantand cut across multiple product lines and businesseshowever in spite of the market talk around this issue wedo not regard a downgrade to doublea as a major eventwhile no one could know all of the ramifications of aworstcase default scenario we believe the impact  whilecostly for jpmorgan chase  would be manageablenew products often will have problemswe need to keep a close eye on the design trading and operationalaspects of new financial products almost all new productsgo through periods of stress and markettesting whichin turn causes problems of one sort or another at one timeeven basic equity trading nearly brought wall street to itsknees when the volume of trades exceeded the systemsprocessing capacity there have been similar problems withexotic mortgage products options foreign exchange highyieldbonds hybrid derivatives and so on in many casesthese issues were eventually resolved through the creation ofstandardized contracts and standard industry exchanges andclearinghouses these in turn facilitated more efficiency inthe clearing and netting of risk provided better regulatorycontrols and led to stronger management oversightmany market participants expected derivatives to be at theheart of the next financial crisis so far most derivativesmarkets have averted the storm and derivatives have servedas an essential tool for some companies to use in sheddingor hedging risk that said there are some legitimate concernsa severe economic downturn could put extreme pressureon the settlement and clearance functions in some ofthe derivatives markets with this and other concerns inmind we can assure you that we are paying close attentionto our derivatives positions and exposure in addition weare strongly in favor of regulatory and industry efforts tocoordinate and improve the control environmenta recession will have a significant impact on creditour business is cyclical and one of the largest risks weface is the impact of a recession on credit in general inlast years letter we addressed the recession and creditissue and what we said then bears repeating nowwe continuously analyze and measure our risk in factduring budget planning we ask our management teamsto prepare  on all levels  for difficult operating environmentswhile the risk comes in many forms such as recessionmarket turmoil and geopolitical turbulence one ofour largest risks is still the credit cycle credit losses bothconsumer and wholesale have been extremely low perhapsamong the best well see in our lifetimes we must beprepared for a return to the norm in the credit cyclein a tougher credit environment credit losses could risesignificantly by as much as  billion over time whichmay require increases in loan loss reserves investmentbank revenue could drop and the yield curve couldsharply invert this could have a significant negativeeffect on jpmorgan chases earnings that said theseevents generally do not occur simultaneously and therewould likely be mitigating factors to lift our earningseg compensation pools would probably go down somecustomer fees and spreads would probably go up andfunding costs could decreaseits important to share these scenarios with you not toworry you but to be as transparent as possible about thepotential impact of these negative scenarios and to let youknow how we are preparing for them we do not knowexactly what will occur or when but we do know thatbad things happen there is no question that our companysearnings could go down substantially in a recessionaryenvironment but if we are prepared we can bothminimize the damage to our company and capitalize onopportunities in the marketplaceshareholder letter because of the extreme drop in home equity and subprimeloan value the losses i referred to last year could be evengreater in  however we believe our strong capitaland the increase of our loan loss reserves have put us ingood shape in  we added  billion to loan lossreserves and we expect to continue adding to thosereserves in  our reserve positions across all of ourbusinesses are among the best in the industrymanaging in a downturn requires a different strategythe impact of a downturn  and its effect on earnings varies considerably by line of business therefore itrequires each of our businesses to develop its own strategyfor dealing with the unique set of risks and mitigatingfactors it could face in some cases returns could actuallyincrease because of higher spreads while in other casesthey could decrease because of lower volumes in anycase however we will remain committed to building thebusiness as such we will not sacrifice longterm value andmeaningful customer service to get better quarterly earningsin fact in certain situations we may actually tradeoff nearterm earnings to gain customers and build marketshare in businesses that are financially viable and of strategicimportance in those instances we are also confidentthat healthy earnings will return we believe the only timeto sacrifice good growth is to protect the financial standingof the company fortunately we are not in that positionb looking forwardwe believe the mortgage business will reboundin spite of all the difficulties in the mortgage markets weremain committed to building the countrys best mortgagecompany the mortgage product is and will continue tobe the largest and arguably one of the single most importantfinancial products in the world with our brandscale systems retail branches and our ability to tradehedge and underwrite mortgages which include primesubprime alta jumbo and home equity loans we havewhat it takes to be a winner in this business during thelatter part of  we set out to increase our home lendingmarket share and have so far succeeded by the endof the fourth quarter of  our share had grown to from  a year earlier as a result of our liquidityand capital strength we were able to underwrite theseloans when others could not although we may pay forprobably starting this expansion a little too early weremain committed to the goalthe risks and rewards of highly structured products willbe reevaluated and changed but securitization willremain viablejpmorgan is a large participant in the assetbacked securitiesmarket which includes cdos and we try to focuson products we believe are transparent and offer reasonablerisks and rewards to investors we deliberately choseto avoid the more structured cdo products because webelieved the inherent risks were too high additionallyour knowledge of the subprime business informed ourdecision to remain very cautious about any subprimecdos where the bulk of the problems has occurredwe think theres a place for structured cdos but not intheir most complicated forms such as cdosquaredstandards will be materially enhanced in terms of accountingoperations and ratings guidelines and many overlycomplex products will go the way of the dinosaurwe also believe that while there will likely be changesto the securitization markets securitization of assets willnot go away securitization is a highly effective way tofinance assets in fact many securitized products likecredit cards have been tested through the market cycleand have not had significant problems securitization ofsubprime assets will probably reopen too  but thestandards will be more conservative and there will be farmore clarity eg better underwriting standards morecapital etc market discipline in some form will alsocome to bear at each stage of the production chain  fromthe originator to the packager to the seller  and requireeach to have the right amount of skin in the game we arenot sure how it will change but between regulation andthe market we know it will  and probably for the betteraccounting can be abused and misusedtheres been a lot of discussion about the pros and cons ofthe marktomodel versus the marktomarket approachwe believe it is critically important to trust the value ofthe assets and liabilities on and off  ones balance sheetregardless of the method one uses marktomarketmarktomodel etc accounting can be abused this letteris not the right place in which to carry on this debatebut suffice it to say accounting has become increasinglycomplex much of this complexity is unnecessary andleads to questionable results adds to earnings volatilityand creates more room for shenanigans not less morework needs to be done to fix thismany of our accounting and regulatory capital requirementsare procyclicalmany of the methods we use to calculate capital and loanloss reserves are procyclical in fact loan loss reserves andcapital are often at their lowest levels at precisely the pointat which a cyclical downturn begins in addition i wouldargue that fair value accounting rules margining requirementsrating agencies and regulatory rules add to procyclicalbehavior thoughtful policy changes could providea substantial cushion to the procyclical forces that make afinancial crisis worse a comprehensive effort between allparties involved regulators government and financial institutionsis needed to develop and drive forward theseimportant policy changes more assets on the books of banks or financial companiesare illiquid or can quickly become illiquidgiven this trend regulators and rating agencies will probablyinsist that the rise of illiquid assets requires higherlevels of capital and proper funding with longerterm debtthere will be a recoverywe simply cannot know how long this slowdown orrecession will last or the extent of the damage it willcause todays most brilliant economists have variousstrong wellargued current views on the subject  theyjust dont all agree in any case our goal is to be preparedin reality our financial system has fairly rapidly and successfullyif not painfully been dealing with most of theissues ive discussed in this letter losses have been takensubstantial capital has been raised and massive deleveraginghas already taken place in hedge funds sivs financialcompanies reits collateralized loan obligations closand cdos while all losses may not be recognized yetour sense is that a lot have been at least for us companiesimportantly the creation of new potentialproblemassets leveraged loans subprime assets clos cdos andcommercial mortgagebacked securities has virtually ceasedso demand will eventually catch up with an ever diminishingsupply of increasingly attractively pricedassets it is unlikely that the pace of deleveraging willintensify therefore it is probable that the financial crisiswill mitigate by yearend in addition fairly large fiscaland monetary stimulation and the new mortgage rulesfor fannie mae freddie mac and the federal housingauthority which will bring more capital to the mortgagemarket could have a positive effect on the markets overallyet even if financial conditions improve the economy couldcontinue to erode causing us to remain in a recessionaryenvironment for a while and it may sound peculiar if infact we are going into a recession that we are also preparingfor interest rates that may trend a lot higher over the nextseveral years we wont go into the reasons nowwe would also like to assure you all of our shareholdersthat while we are preparing for an extended financial crisiswe will never lose sight of our primary purpose to build astrong company and great franchise for the long termiv in
