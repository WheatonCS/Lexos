jpmorgan chase made very good progress in we earned billionfrom continuing operations up significantly from the year before we grewour major businesses and the growth was high quality and we positionedourselves extremely well for and beyondin this letter i will review and assess our  performance and describe keyinitiatives and issues we are focusing on this year and in the future to makeour company even better i hope after reading this letter that you will sharemy enthusiasm about the emerging power and enormous potential of thejpmorgan chase franchisefirst lets look at   our performance in  progressand renewed focusat jpmorgan chase we analyze our performance againsta broad spectrum of measures including growth qualityrisk management marketing collaboration operationscontrols and compliance we continue to make significantprogress on all these fronts although our absolute performanceis not yet where it should be the pace and levelof improvement are extremely good and make us moreconfident than ever about our futurestarting with financial performance we believe thereare six key aspects of our overall  performance thatillustrate the progress we have madestrengthened financial performanceour earnings from continuing operations for the yearwere  billion up from  billion in return on equity excluding goodwill was  versus revenue growth  almost all organic  was these results produced with the support of a stillfavorablecredit environment are good but not excellentand in some cases we still trail our major competitorswhile were not yet toptier in financial performance wefeel particularly good about a number of major issueswe essentially completed a huge complex merger whilestaying focused on business and pursuing growth wedramatically cut expenses and waste and we increasedinvestment spending integration risk  the potential tosuffer major setbacks because of mergerrelated issues is always a big challenge and source of concern butsuperb execution throughout  and  hasenabled us to put that risk mostly behind usincreased management discipline and collaborationultimately we will succeed or fail based upon the talentdedication and diligence of our management team andthe people who work with them on this measure youour shareholders should be extremely pleased yourmanagement team regularly reviews all aspects of ourbusiness in an open and honest way assessing ourstrengths and weaknesses and our opportunities andrisks the level of collaboration among business units ishigher than ever and still getting better our top managerswork well together respect each other and takepride in each others successes as i have stressed in priorshareholder letters getting people to work togetheracross all business units is critical to our success here are some examples of what we can achieve byworking well together in all of these cases the managementteam came together  to review facts and criticallyanalyze and reanalyze issues  in order to find the rightanswers for our clients and our company we developedand executed a game plan without the destructive politicssilly gameplaying and selfish arguments about revenuesharing that can destroy healthy collaboration andundermine progressestablishing the corporate bankpreviously our investment bankers played the lead rolein managing our firms relationships with large clientseven when a client might require noninvestmentbankingproducts and services such as cash managementcustody asset management certain credit and derivativesproducts and others the product salespeople outsideour investment bank operated somewhat independentlyfrom the investment bankers as a result we were notmanaging our relationships with many of our largestclients in an integrated and coordinated way too manypeople were selling their own products without feelingaccountable for jpmorgan chases overall relationshipwith the clientnow we have addressed this issue with dedicatedcorporate bankers who cover the treasurers offices of ourlargest longeststanding and most important clientsthese corporate bankers in partnership with our investmentbankers are focused on developing our entire relationshipwith our clients  orchestrating the coverageeffort with regular account planning client reviews andcoordinated calling this effort ultimately should addhundreds of millions of dollars to revenue and createhappier clientsbuilding the mortgage business  in home lending andthe investment bankhome lending is one of the largest originators and servicersof mortgages in the united states separately ourinvestment bank has been working hard to build out itsmortgage capabilities as the mortgage business overallhas been undergoing fundamental change ie mortgagesare increasingly being packaged and sold to institutionalinvestors rather than being held by the companythat originates themhistorically our two businesses home lending andthe investment bank barely worked together in almost no home lending mortgages were sold throughour investment bank this past year however ourinvestment bank sold  of the nonagency mortgagesapproximately  billion worth originated by homelending as a result home lending materially increasedits product breadth and volume because it could distributeand price more competitively this arrangementobviously helped our sales efforts and the investmentbank was able to build a better business with a clearcompetitive advantage in  our investment bankmoved up several places in the leaguetable rankings formortgages importantly home lending maintained itshigh underwriting standards more on this later webelieve that we now have the opportunity to become oneof americas best mortgage companiesgrowing credit card sales through retail branchesin  we opened more than one million credit cardaccounts through our retail branches up  over retail and card services teams drove this progressby working together and analyzing every facet of thebusiness including product design marketing creditreporting systems and staffing it started slowly but asweve learned together and innovated weve been able toadd increasingly more profitable new accounts we havethe ability to provide  almost instantaneously  preapprovedcredit to customers while they are opening otherbanking accounts with us and while respecting customerprivacy we now can offer better pricing becausewe can underwrite using both credit card and retailcustomer information over time this competitiveadvantage will enable us to add more value and producebetter results for customers and for jpmorgan chaseapproaching asia holisticallyour operating committee members traveled to asialate last year and reviewed how we were doing countrybycountry the reviews spanned all lines of businessthis process shed new light on our businesses sharpenedour focus on ways we could work together to improveperformance and strengthened our resolve to executeaggressively this year the business plans in each countryare not only appropriately more ambitious but alsobetter coordinated and fully supported by the rest of thecompany as this effort is replicated in other parts of theworld we are confident it will strengthen our operationsand opportunitiesworking better togetherthere are plenty of other examples where good collaborationhas made us better our commercial banking clientslast year generated over  million of investment bankingrevenue up  from  the merger made thispossible by bringing toptier investment bank productsto an extensive commercial banking customer base inaddition our treasury  securities services group does asignificant amount of business with our commercialbanking client base our asset management group callson commercial banking and investment bank customersand works with investment bankers to identify clients whocan benefit from our private banking services clientsacross all of our businesses use our branches we can usethis kind of disciplined and collaborative approach acrossour businesses to continue to build on the distinctivestrength of our extensive capabilities and relationshipsachieved quality growth driving future growthits easy to grow shortterm earnings just stop investingin your companys future and compromise yourstandards on accepting new clients and businesswe wont do thatvirtually all of our businesses achieved real healthygrowth you can see this described more fully in thepages ahead so ill just reflect on a few key items our goal is to accomplish real sustainable growth butnot growth at any cost in the financial services worldit is easy to stretch for growth by reducing underwritingstandards or taking on increasingly higher levels of riskbut such an approach is foolish longer term for examplelast year we declined to underwrite negative amortizationmortgage loans and option adjustablerate mortgagesthat may have hurt our  earnings a bit butwe believe it was the right decision for the company were growing our earnings but not at the expense ofsmart longerterm investments we continue to investin the areas that drive future growth such as  newretail branches last year  additional salespeople inbranches  new private bankers to serve our ultrahighnetworth clients and stronger trading businessesin mortgages energy and other commodities where it made sense we went outside our companyand acquired great assets and businesses such as theswap of our corporate trust business for  bank ofnew york retail branches and the banks commercialbanking business we also did smaller deals to supplementour student loan hedge fund processing assetmanagement trading and credit card businesses these investments are not confined to the front officeweve invested hundreds of millions of dollars innew and improved systems which i will discuss nextwhile theres a shortterm cost for these investmentstheres a longterm benefit of increased efficiency andimproved qualitymaterially improved infrastructure and cost structurewe continued a massive investment plan in our systemsand operating infrastructure while simultaneouslyreducing expenses we completed major consolidations and mergers ofour platforms retail deposit and teller wholesaleloan and internet we have built or are building six new data centersand are upgrading and consolidating the more than centers that we had three years ago through thiseffort were significantly enhancing our data networksstorage and information technology risk capabilities virtually all of our businesses improved their marginswhile investing for the future the singlemost salientcost reduction came in our corporate line you mayrecall that in  we said we would maintain atcorporate all of what we deemed to be inefficientcosts ie costs borne by the businesses withoutreceiving commensurate benefits and costs that weredramatically higher than they should have beenexamples included vacant real estate outdated datacenters information technology costs that were sometimestwo to three times what they should have beenor staff support costs that were simply too highwe moved these costs to corporate so we coulda see what the businesses were really earning b bringinto sharp relief these corporate expenses and putpressure on ourselves to reduce them and c hold thebusinesses accountable for clearly defined costs thatthey could controlwell it worked unallocated corporate overheadwas  billion in  was  million in and is expected to be  million to  millionin improved risk managementto be a great company we must excel at risk managementacross all of our businesses  consumer commercialand wholesale we understand that some risks orcorrelations of risks are often unknowable or whenknowable unpredictable as to timing later i will talkabout some of these risks we face going forward buthere i will simply review  we think we did a fairlygood job overall though there are some areas  especiallyrelated to mortgage servicing rights  where we areworking to do significantly better both consumer and wholesale credit performed wellmore important we stuck to certain disciplines thatnow are serving us well we made judgment calls thatreduced revenue and often appeared very conservativeand where we chose to underwrite subprime mortgageswe adhered to strict underwriting standardswe sold almost all of our  subprime mortgageoriginations but retained our capacity to hold suchmortgages when we believe that it is more financiallyprudent to do so our private equity investments are now about billion a very comfortable  of tangible equitydown from more than  in  we think ourteams in this business are doing an outstanding joband believe we have many good opportunities togrow our private equity business we successfully managed the interestrate cycle tominimize its impact on results we took action basedupon constant analysis and backtesting of interestratemoves in each and every product more important wehave tried and continue to try to balance our exposuresso that extreme rate moves which didnt happenin  dont hurt us significantly so while flat orslightly inverted yield curves may squeeze margins forus as they do for our competitors we are not thatconcerned about it our big concern is to protect ourcompany from major rate changes we materially improved the quality consistency andlevel of our trading results  a major focus in and we specifically mean results versus trading volatilitywe want to earn a better average return on capitalwith growing revenue we will accept more volatilitybut we must be paid for the risk were taking throughincreased revenue in  we did a bit of bothvolatility was down while trading revenue was upsubstantially by almost  billion our investment bank management team accomplishedthis improved risk management by a successfullybuilding out new trading capabilities such as mortgageand energy which helped diversify trading riskb regular reporting and reviews particularly of largerisk positions c increasing focus and accountability onspecific trading risk and d more actively managingoverall exposures we clearly can do better on mortgage servicing rightsmsrs than we did in  msrs are the presentvalue of net revenue estimated to be received for servicingmortgages ie billing and collecting we serviceover  billion of mortgages and our msr isvalued on our balance sheet at about  billion it isa volatile assumptionbased asset that can swing invalue from quarter to quarter even when fully hedgedas we previously reported our msr asset and relatedhedges posted losses of almost  million in which is unacceptable as a result weve spent a lot oftime improving our models to make them far moresophisticated and drilling down to examine repaymentissues and other factors  statebystate and productbyproduct weve worked closely with our investmentbank to incorporate the best from all the modelsit is essential we get this right and weve made goodprogress we think were about  there how wevalue and manage this asset will be either a competitivestrength or weakness our degree of success is a keyeconomic variable that can help us originate anddistribute loans more inexpensively companies thatmanage msrs incorrectly will give back a lot ofpreviously booked profits but companies that get itright  and we intend to be one of them  will havea huge competitive advantage in an extremely price competitivebusinesspicked up the paceall in all we feel that weve made about as much progressas we could have in  as we move toward our finalmajor mergerrelated integration  the conversion of ournew york wholesale platform later this year  we aredeclaring the merger of jpmorgan chase and bank oneto be essentially complete so we are  in the best sense ofthe phrase  back to business as usual and that is whereyou want us to beback to business as usual means we are moving beyondworking on major oneoff integration projects and we arelooking more and more to the future well continue tofocus on all the basics like people and systems and complianceand audit as well as wastecutting and bureaucracybusting but we can also look clearly to the future andfocus on initiatives that will set us apart by acceleratinggrowth and helping us achieve excellent financial resultsour confidence is strong in our ability to do this becausethe teams that have already accomplished so much aresimply updating their missionwe are striving for sustained financial performanceincluding revenue growth better margins and returnson capital that compare favorably with the best ofour competitorsfinally back to business as usual means that while we arerunning our businesses better and generating good organicgrowth we are also receptive to the mergers and acquisitionsthat make sense for shareholders to be viable theseopportunities must clear three important hurdles theprice must be right the business logic must be compellingand our ability to execute must be strong it is on thislast point that many deals fail and it is on this last pointthat we now have confidence earned by what we havealready accomplishedthe ability to execute a merger is a key strength that we donot want to squander on a bad transaction we do notintend to do anything that is not in our shareholdersinterest we are patient our internal opportunities aboundand our prospects are good without any acquisitions i i  looking ahead key initiativesand issuesthere are six important initiatives or issues we are tacklingto help us become what we truly want to be  aconsistently highperforming highly respected financialservices companyimproving quality and servicenow that our merger work and consolidations aremainly done we are turning more attention to improvingquality and service  from front to back we meanthis in an allencompassing way whether its a customersexperience with a teller straightthrough processingimproved operations call center performance betterautomated crossselling or dozens of other areas thisapplies to anything that affects the customer  andanything that makes it easier or better for our peopleservicing the customer it includes cutting down onerrors which cost our company money slow us downand annoy the customerthe outcome we are convinced will be happier customersand lower attrition more crossselling and lowercosts associated with more automation and fewer problemsthe good news is that we have the focus the willand the people to do this theyre the same ones whoalready have delivered so much throughout our mergerwork and consolidationsraising productivitywhile over the past few years we have devoted significantattention to wastecutting and cost reduction weare now focusing more broadly on productivity overallan example would be how we assess the effectiveness ofa sales force a sales force might have the right numberof salespeople and the right products but productivitycould still be enhanced in multiple ways more salesper salesperson more sales from new products or oldproducts same sales but higher profitability per sale orsame sales and same profits but deeper relationshipswith customersto achieve consistently high margins and returns relativeto the competition we need to achieve high levels ofproductivity everywhere and every step of the way at every business unit in every branch with everysales force in all of our systems programming unitsand across all our product marketing any companyincluding ours can lose focus or be sloppy in managingproductivity at these levels here are a few examplesof how we have improved productivity investment bank we determined that our bankers inthe united states were covering too many clients andit is expensive simply to cover a client while revenueper banker was adequate our product penetration perclient was too low so we reduced the number ofclients each banker covers and the results should bevery positive the client should end up getting moreattention the banker should do more business with theclient and our revenue should go up since we alreadyhad a complete product set for bankers to sell andbecause there are increasingly more companies thatneed our services it was a nobrainer to add bankersthe investment bank this year is also intensifyingits focus on reducing middleoffice and backofficesupport costs our noncompensation expenses are toohigh and as the investment bank has developed betterfinancial management tools were better equipped toattack these excessive support costs we believe thatthese excess costs could be as much as  million credit card marketing last year we did a good jobreducing our costs of attracting opening and servicingnew credit card accounts but to maximize opportunitieswe need to become better at matching products tocustomers differentiating between the profitability ofnew branchgenerated accounts versus those generatedacross other channels such as the internet determiningwhat other business we should be doing with thenew card holder and ensuring that our current cardholders have the right products and rewards programswe already have made good strides cards withrewards programs are now  of our card outstandingsup from  in  and accounts generatedfrom directmail solicitations which often come withlow introductory rates and higher attrition rates aredown to  from  in  we have muchmore work to do to continue this progress commercial banking sales force management nowcommercial banking rigorously tracks resultsand profitability by banker and by client we haveour bankers work with their clients to ensure that allclients are profitable to the firm and that all clientsbenefit from their relationship with the firm new products in commercial banking this past yearcommercial banking continued to expand its productoffering it added subordinated debt mezzanine financingand even equity investing we already had the clientsthey just were going elsewhere for these products private bank were making it easier for qualified individualsto do business with us beginning with howthey open new private bank accounts in the past theyhad to review at least six different documents and signmultiple times just to start working with us now anew customer usually fills out only a onepage formand signs it only once everyones happier and we savesome treesincreasing marketing creativity and focusour company needs to become better at marketingand by marketing we dont mean more television ads ordirect mail solicitations we mean taking a sophisticatedapproach to identifying a group of customers figuringout what they need and then delivering it to them betterthan anyone else the opportunities are significant wehave multiple efforts under way and we want to giveyou a few examples of themdevelop a better offering for affluent clientswe believe we do a very good job serving our ultrahighnetworth clients  those with more than million of investable assets but we can do a lot morefor the hundreds of thousands of affluent householdsthat fall below that ultrahigh thresholdwhether through our retail branches our card businessor our private client services unit we interact with tensof thousands of very wealthy individuals every day butin many cases we havent identified them as affluent orwe havent focused on providing them with the right setof products that is tailored to meet their unique needsin  we intend to do a comprehensive analysis ofthis affluent market and then develop and begin to executea game plan the likely result will be better identificationof affluent clients solutions and rewards programsthat cut across multiple products more tailoredproducts and specialized marketing and servicinguse customer knowledge to refine products upgrade serviceour customers trust us and give us a lot of informationso we can know them better while respecting a customersprivacy we can use this information to makebetterinformed decisions about what to offer customersand how to evaluate themweve already mentioned how we can instantaneouslyoffer an approved credit card to customers while they areopening a checking account we can also underwrite thecredit better ie offer more competitive pricing basedupon our proprietary knowledge of the customer wereworking on many other similar initiatives where ourknowledge of the customer preemptively positions us inbusinesses such as home equity mortgage auto creditcard retail branches and small businesscoordinate outreach to specific groupsthere are many different subsets of customers we servewho would appreciate and benefit from a coordinatedapproach to their specific needsone clear example involves universities surprisinglywe had not coordinated our outreach to this lucrativemarket retail opened student checking accountseducation finance made student loans card servicesissued credit cards to students and alumni commercialbanking financed schools and serviced cash managementneeds and our asset management group managed universityfunds were fixing this by working on a synchronizedeffort where a specialized sales team can offer a fully coordinatedpackage more effectively and more efficientlyexpanding to serve consumers outside the united statesinternational consumer expansion is not without riskso one of our first objectives has been to add seniorindividuals to our talent pool who are knowledgeableand experienced in the international consumer area inaddition we are now analyzing and developing countryspecificstrategies so that we can focus our efforts on themost important opportunities we are fortunate to havedeveloped strong relationships and partnerships over theyears so we have people and companies we trust and canrely upon for advice and access to investment opportunitiesaround the worldthere are some essential principles supporting this effortthat we want our shareholders to understand because restrictions on acquisitions  and other lawsand regulations  differ by country our approach mustdiffer by country in some areas we may acquirepartial interests or controlling stakes in companieswhile in others we may start de novo we will not stretch excessively to make investmentswe believe that in many parts of the world it is notnecessary to feel desperate as if the opportunities willexist only for a fleeting moment we believe that asjpmorgan chase grows and strengthens its opportunitieswill increase we also believe that in five to  yearsas some countries develop and change new and excitingopportunities will emerge for example to the extentthat we would consider a merger or acquisition ineurope there are likely to be many more paneuropeanbanks to choose from in the future in china or indiawe might be allowed to buy a controlling interest in abank the set of options available to my successor willbe dramatically different from and possibly superiorto the current set of options with that in mind thebest thing i can do for her or him is pass on a strongjpmorgan chasemanaging critical risksthe first half of this letter mentions that we were fairlypleased with how we managed risk in  but managingrisk is a constant challenge we never stop worryingabout it before discussing some specific risk issues webelieve you should be able to take some comfort fromthese key facts our profit margins have increased substantially creatingour best cushion for risk our balance sheet is strong and getting strongertier i capital at the end of  was  and evenwith stock buybacks it should stay strong because ofour improving capital generation our loan loss reserves are strong at  for bothconsumer and wholesale at the end of  here are some specific risk issueschallenges in the credit worldwe continuously analyze and measure our risk in factduring budget planning we ask our management teamsto prepare  on all levels  for difficult operating environmentswhile the risk comes in many forms such asrecession market turmoil and geopolitical turbulenceone of our largest risks is still the credit cycle creditlosses both consumer and wholesale have been extremelylow perhaps among the best well see in our lifetimeswe must be prepared for a return to the norm in thecredit cyclethe chart below shows a rough estimate of what couldhappen to credit costs over the business cycle  providedwe do a good and disciplined job underwriting creditin a tougher credit environment credit losses could risesignificantly by as much as  billion over time whichmay require increases in loan loss reserves investmentbank revenue could drop and the yield curve couldsharply invert this could have a significant negativeeffect on jpmorgan chases earnings that said theseevents generally do not occur simultaneously and therewould be normal mitigating factors for our earningseg compensation pools likely would go down somecustomer fees and spreads would probably go up andfunding costs could decreaseits important to share these numbers with you not toworry you but to be as transparent as possible about thepotential impact of these negative scenarios and to let youknow how we are preparing for them we do not knowexactly what will occur or when but we do know that badthings happen there is no question that our companysearnings could go down substantially but if we are preparedwe can both minimize the damage to our companyand capitalize on opportunities in the marketplacesubprime mortgages the good the bad and possiblythe uglythe goodwe did a lot of things right we did not originate option arms or other negativeamortization loans we applied the same underwriting standards to allof our subprime loans whether originated by us orpurchased from third parties we sold substantially all of our  subprime originationswe underwrite all of our subprime loans to beheld in fact we prefer to hold and service these mortgagesbut prices at the time of sale were too good topass up we were very careful in certain parts of the unitedstates and were especially careful to seek accurateproperty appraisals the bad default rates were still higher than we had predicted in hindsight when underwriting subprime we couldhave been even more conservative and less sensitive tomarket and competitor practices weve now materiallytightened certain underwriting standards on subprimemortgages we dont expect that losses on our subprime loanswould go up by more than about  million  notso bad but we prefer it werent sopossibly the uglywe do not yet know the ultimate impact of recent industryexcesses and mismanagement in the subprime marketbad underwriting practices probably extended into manymortgage categories as government officials investigatethe market and losses mount the industry is tighteningunderwriting standards by reducing loantovalue ratiosand using more conservative property values there willbe more due diligence on incomes and credit qualitymore rigid standards increase foreclosures and make itmore difficult to buy homes this will lead to a lowernumber of sales and a reduction in home valuesthe good news is this is happening in a healthy job environmentwhich is still the most important determinant ofgood consumer credit the subprime business is a greatexample of what happens when something good the abilityto help a lot more people buy homes is taken toexcess even so we still believe that subprime mortgagescould be a very good business and that when it all sortsout we will be wellpositionedenhancing our corporate social responsibility standardslast year we wrote to you about how our company is
