on a path toward greater efficiency less bureaucracy focused investments and higher growth both six sigma and technological innovation will play a significant role in enhancing distribution service quality and client intimacy the growth potential that we see at jpmorgan chase is reflected in the performance targets that we have outlined as longterm goals annual revenue growth of  average cash return on equity of  cash earnings per share growth of  certainly we did not achieve these financial targets in  revenue growth was affected by challenging markets and our cash return on equity fell to  but in  we did not have the benefit of the significant synergies that we see in the new jpmorgan chase and in fact were hampered by the significant expense and capital demands of building the platform in reasonable markets our ability to achieve these targets will be a matter of execution to this end we are absolutely committed to disciplined execution on four fronts merger integration management expense control risk management and capital management merger integration management  we believe this merger will create pretax synergies of  billion   billion of cost savings and  billion of incremental net revenue our experience in past mergers has helped us to develop a detailed process of tracking accountability for business execution the best evidence of our success to date is the fact that we were able to close on the formation of our new firm in less than four months an important accomplishment for both client coverage and employee retention expense control  capital investment and commitments to new capabilities in investment banking in  put significant pressure on our ability to manage expenses flexibly we are targeting cash operating expenses for  to be flat with  pro forma for robert fleming for fullyear  over the long term we intend to use six sigma techniques to reengineer both costs and quality and improve productivity we also will call on labmorgan our efinance unit to help us do business more efficiently and in new ways to create value for the firm and our clients labmorgan identifies implements invests in and nurtures the efinance ideas that will continue to transform jpmorgan chase risk management  disciplined management of market credit and operating risks is fundamental to protecting shareholder value  an intense focus on the predecessor firms over the last  years we will maintain our rigorous stress testing of market risk under historical and hypothetical scenarios our credit portfolio will continue to be highly diversified with a strong focus on distribution instead of retention and limits on concentration by customer industry and geography capital management  we will continue with our shareholder value added sva discipline that pushes right down to the individual transaction level the tradeoff between employing capital in our businesses and returning it to our shareholders with carefully managed balance sheet growth and current capital ratios currently in excess of our longterm target this sva discipline should lead to earnings growth and free cash flow generation for our stockholders from the perspective of all of us who interact with clients and markets every day the opportunities ahead of us are enormous there is tangible excitement within the corridors of this new company and while it remains a challenging environment with plenty of solid competitors we believe that jpmorgan chase has the best longterm platform to compete and win the success of the present firm is built on shoulders of those who preceded us in the past decade john mcgillicuddy walter shipley and tom labrecque set the standard for successful integration of large complex firms we mourn the untimely passing of tom labrecque and we appreciate all the more his commitment to integrity and the example he set our focus today is on realizing the potential of the new jpmorgan chase we have been through a very demanding period of integration and have achieved a degree of cultural alignment that we have found remarkable our style in mergers is to ask our people to manage their ongoing business and to execute the merger integration simultaneously there is still a lot of hard work ahead of us to accomplish our goals and realize our potential but if the performance to date is any guide the people of jpmorgan chase are more than up to the task
