it was a challenging year for most companies including our own the economy already weak at the outset of the year fell into a fullfledged recession in the spring then came the tragedy of september this tested the strength and resilience of the international financial system while financial institutions including our firm passed the test with flying colors subsequent events including the collapse of enron undermined confidence in financial markets and raised serious questions about the integrity of accounting practices despite these challenges over the course of  we continued to build and enhance the competitiveness of the newly created jpmorgan chase i am pleased to report that  we moved with great speed and purpose in executing a massive and complex merger melding two great organizations into one our employee polls show a tremendous level of internal support for the new firm  in the midst of a massive merger integration effort we gained share in most of our client and product activities including global mergers and acquisitions the origination of bond issues loan syndications and derivatives in doing so we demonstrated the value of our expanded franchise to clients in the face of difficult and volatile market conditions  we aggressively reduced expenses and increased our goal for mergerrelated cost savings from  billion to  billion by the end of  we had captured more than threequarters of our expected savings nevertheless our  results were disappointing combined with declining stock markets and a sharp reduction in the volume of mergers and acquisitions and initial public offerings the recession made for a weak revenue environment for our investment banking asset management and custody businesses in addition we had substantial losses in jpmorgan partners our private equity business lastly there was an overall decline in credit quality in  affecting both commercial and consumer credit all of these factors weighed heavily on our results in  and will most likely extend into  we are dealing with all the issues in front of us and we are doing so from a position of considerable strength our cash operating return on equity in  was   well below our target excluding the losses in jpmorgan partners historically a very profitable business our cash operating return on equity was a more respectable  our tier  capital ratio at yearend was   well above the federal reserves standard for a wellcapitalized institution finally the credit performance of our loan portfolio both commercial and consumer held up better than industry averages at yearend nonperforming assets represented about  of equity better than most of our peers by contrast the comparable ratio for certain of our predecessor institutions in the early s  the last recession in the us was more than  in addition commercial loan chargeoffs against loans outstanding were  basis points in  compared with  basis points for our peer group as we move beyond the current difficult credit cycle there is much opportunity for improvement continuing progress in reducing costs and increasing productivity will result in a higher proportion of revenues flowing to the bottom line we expect our private equity business which historically has generated outstanding returns to return to profitability we have realigned this business to reduce and diversify our risk by creating new private equity funds that enable us to invest our capital alongside our clients our firm brings together an extraordinary breadth of capabilities  in investment banking operating services private banking  asset management private equity and retail and middle market financial services there is no question we have a tremendous strategic platform it is combined with a strong commitment to financial discipline and rigorous risk management across all of our businesses even though we are going through one of the most difficult environments in recent times i have never been more confident in the future of the firm vision and strategy by delivering our broad deep and integrated global capabilities in a timely efficient and creative manner we expect to create exceptional value for our shareholders clients and employees we see three strategic requirements to succeed scale leadership positions and integrated talent and product delivery  we also believe that our diversified business model combining wholesale and consumer financial services will give us more growth opportunity and earnings stability over time let me begin with our global investment banking business which accounts for nearly half of our total revenues because the strategic landscape in this area could not be any clearer the number of fullservice firms in this field has been declining and those that remain are becoming more and more capable a handful of major global firms are emerging as the leaders in this sector and we are among them the musthaves to be a leader in the wholesale space are clear scale in terms of capital clients and products is the first musthave jpmorgan chase has all of those attributes we are one of the largest banks in the world in terms of revenues total assets income and market capitalization  in addition nearly half of our revenues and income in wholesale banking comes from our activities outside the us with a strong presence in europe asia and latin america we have the size and the reach to act as an integrated fullservice provider to corporations governments and other institutions on a global basis but size alone is not enough the second musthave is leadership positions across a wide range of products and services from syndicating loans to underwriting bond and equity issues to trading securities and advising clients on mergers and acquisitions and other complex business transactions our model enables us to provide creative and integrated solutions to globally oriented clients as a result of our many leadership positions and our deep relations with clients we are able to act on their behalf in taking advantage of windows of opportunity that may open in one area just as they are slamming shut in another that happened in  in a sudden shift from equities to bonds as the preferred method of raising capital for many companies we have essentially all of the pieces now we must prove that we can provide seamless and superb execution the ideal firm  the firm we have visualized in our minds eye as the new model for success  combines the breadth and clout of a big firm with the creativity and agility of a highquality niche player from a full gamut of leadership positions with the insight that comes from a close working relationship with the client and as a result of the ability to act truly as one team our people should be able to propose and deliver the exact right combination of products and services in any market in any economic conditions anywhere in the world that is the essence of the third musthave integrated talent and product delivery as part of this integrated delivery the capability to use our balance sheet intelligently to help our clients will i believe become an increasingly important differentiation in gaining market share against our competitors that do not have this capability during  we completed a number of complex transactions for clients that illustrate the power and potential of such a model to cite one example we were the lead arranger on a  billionplus financing package that enabled a major japanese automobile company to build a new assembly plant in the us by combining investor coverage between jpmorgan teams in new york and tokyo our firm was able to provide hour support and close an extremely complex transaction with several interlocking components a syndicated loan saleleaseback and commercial paper within a very tight time frame at the same time this was a transaction that depended from the start upon a close toplevel and longestablished relationship between our firm and the client there are abundant opportunities for synergy across many of our businesses and multiple avenues for creating additional value for existing and new clients our clients can benefit from our unique capabilities in investment banking investment management and private banking treasury and securities services and private equity investing and our global client base of corporations governments and high net worth individuals is second to none but that is not all there is to jpmorgan chase we also have a powerful and multifaceted retail financial services franchise while our wholesale businesses are known globally as jpmorgan our retail businesses market themselves under the chase name like our wholesale businesses our retail businesses maintain leadership positions in key products and activities have broad scale and demonstrate a real commitment to delivering the greatest value to the customer in retail as in wholesale we are known for technological excellence  both in the quality of backoffice infrastructure and in the knowledge and expertise of our people chase ranks among the leaders in the us marketplace in credit cards mortgage lending and auto finance we have more than  million credit card accounts across the us are the number one originator of auto loans excluding the finance operations of the auto companies themselves and are one of the leading originators of mortgages chase is a broadscale and extremely efficient provider of these important personal financial services at a regional level we have strong branch networks in the tristate area of new york new jersey and connecticut as well as in texas in the tristate area we are number one in deposit share and number one in middle market and small business lending and finance finally through brown  company we have a profitable online brokerage operation geared to high net worth individuals though small brown  company operates on a national level and represents a vehicle for potential future growth while the market for financial services is far more fragmented on the retail side than it is in wholesale certain fundamentals apply in both worlds one is the importance of flawless execution that is why we are using the six sigma approach to drive improvements in quality and efficiency throughout jpmorgan chase whether the product is a  mortgage or a multibillion dollar underwriting we aim to get everything right the first time similarly in all of our businesses we have invested heavily  not just in systems but in the education of our people  in making the best and most creative use of technology in wholesale and retail financial services alike our simple goal is to provide bestinclass products and integrated solutions that meet the complete financial needs of all of our clients and customers certainly that is the way all of us at jpmorgan chase felt in the days and weeks following september  the response of our people throughout the firm in tending to clients of every description was nothing short of extraordinary they did everything from opening a business recovery center to speeding the refinancing of a major airline to working double shifts in london and tokyo to keep the worlds foreign exchange and payments system working one firm  one team formally concluded on the last day of  the merger of jp morgan and chase manhattan brought together two of the greatest names in banking  with a combined history spanning hundreds of years not only was ours one of the most complex mergers in the history of financial services but it also has been the most swiftly and fully executed of mergers we did not wait to break down boundaries and build new teams and organizations from the ground up we entered into this merger with a mindset of equality and inclusiveness it helps i believe that we had a decades worth of prior experience in putting together large mergers and acquisitions our attitude is simply this pick the best people pick the best systems pick the best strategy and do not wait to make the tough decisions that have to be made to cut costs and capitalize on opportunities for topline growth we also have put a huge emphasis on communications  on creating a common culture and aligning all our people around the vision and strategy people want to be part of a team and they especially want to be part of a winning team at jpmorgan chase the vast majority of our employees responding to internal polls have signaled strong satisfaction with and commitment to the new firm clearly most can see we are building a winning platform and they are excited to be part of it we have launched a broad range of leadership initiatives across the firm including leadershipmorganchase our own version of a leadership and cultural learning center jack welch former chairman of general electric  who is both a great leader and a great teacher  is acting as an advisor to us in this and other endeavors involving leadership development leadershipmorganchase will be an important tool in creating a strong common culture that capitalizes on opportunities for synergy across our firm and enables us to achieve true leadership in global financial services in conclusion this past year also witnessed significant change in our senior management as sandy warner retired as chairman of the board his leadership and dedication helped create a smooth transition as two firms became one i want to thank him for his invaluable partnership and for helping to create a foundation upon which our team will build in addition marina whitman professor of business administration and public policy at the university of michigan will retire from our board of directors on the eve of the  annual meeting of stockholders i deeply appreciate the counsel and guidance she has provided for the past  years jpmorgan chase is entering a new era no longer are we consumed with the task of putting together the different pieces needed to achieve our vision of a richly diversified firm that will be one of the true leaders in global banking we essentially have all of those capabilities inhouse we have built a tremendous platform so now our task is to deliver  to perform i am very confident of our ability to do just that william b harrison jr chairman and chief executive officer march
