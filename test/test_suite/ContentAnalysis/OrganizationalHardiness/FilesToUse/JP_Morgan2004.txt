growth while also completing the first phase of integrating internationaloperations in  countries in  our goal will be to merge technology systems and leverage thebroader set of product capabilities achieved through the mergeriii our prioritiesdevelop and maintain strong financial discipline financial discipline is the bedrockupon which great companies are built great companies prevail through both good and bad economictimes and consistently deliver solid performance relative to competitors our goal is to become oneof those companies financial discipline requiressuperior financial reporting and management information systems in  we created a new internaland external financial reporting architecture with highquality and transparent accounting policiesthat cover capital allocation revenue sharing expense allocation and fundstransfer pricing we thenworked with our line of business leaders and their respective chief financial officers to developcomprehensive financial and operating metrics to use in building their businesses today thousandsof profitandloss statements  including one for each of our  branches for example  help usallocate capital appropriately and drive performance we strive to use one set of numbers inside andoutside the company to bring consistency and clarity to how we view and measure performancewhile we are satisfied with the progress we have made to date the real benefit will come over timeas our management teams increasingly use these toolsa fortress balance sheet a fortress balance sheet requires a thorough understanding and managementof our assets and liabilities the use of conservative appropriate accounting tight financial controlsstrong loan loss reserves and a commitment to solid credit ratings we want a balance sheet ofunquestioned strengthwith a fortress balance sheet we can withstand  perhaps even benefit from  difficult times and bedeliberate in our capital allocation decisions last year we paid dividends of  per share andspent  million to repurchase stock while making key investments in our business and ended theyear with a strong tier  capital ratio of accountability for performance financial reports alone wont suffice they are simply tools financialdiscipline also requires those in charge to have a deep understanding of their businesses and of whatdrives profitability and growth each month the management team from each line of business meetswith us to discuss financial performance revenue growth risk management competitive threatsproductivity innovation key initiatives and talent managementin the beginning these meetings were somewhat painful for most of us too often they ended withmore questions than answers many managers were asked to dive more deeply into the numbers andbe more toughminded about the reasons why certain initiatives were not on target although theyarent yet where they should be our meetings are becoming more open candid and focused in addition to placing more accountability for performance within each line of business each businessneeds to increasingly give its field managers the clear and appropriate authority they need to bemore accountable and responsive to customers and local market conditionsidentifying pricing and managing risk all of our businesses must be properly paid for assumingrisk all forms of risk  interest credit market liquidity operational technology and business must be categorized valued measured and dynamically managed in the constantly changing economicand business environment while we continue to set risk policy and manage overall risk centrallywe have established line of business risk committees that are accountable for risk performance withinthe business by working directly with the businesses we are creating an informed risk culturethat responds more quickly to business and economic changes and strives to avoid surprisescut waste and improve efficiency through outstanding systems and operationsa financial services company cannot win unless it is a lowcost provider this requires eliminatingwaste and creating the most effective systems and most efficient operations in the business we are wellon our way for example we have completed the credit card industrys largestever systems conversion moving  ofour visa and mastercard cardmember base to a faster more flexible and costeffective processingsystem the remaining  will be converted in  at which point all  million credit cardswill be serviced through a single technology platform already the leader in us dollar funds transfers we

best most efficient systems and operations in our industryby yearend  we hope to have completed nearly  conversions and reduced our totalnumber of systems by approximately  it is an undertaking that will require more than  millionpeople hours and at least  million hours of systems testing when the process is complete mostof our systems will be on single and upgraded platforms this will give us a distinct edge in providingour customers with products and services that are competitively superior in qualityinnovation and price during the next two years our systems conversions will be one of our mostdifficult challenges but we will do whatever it takes to get them rightinvest for growth business cannot grow simply by improving efficiency growth requires alaserlike focus on execution a consistent management of risk a competitive product set and outstandingcustomer service we are not interested in growth simply for the sake of growth we are looking for good growth ie good products that meet customer needs and can be profitable overa sustained period of timealthough we currently hold leadership positions in virtually every business we are in there is roomto grow in all of them we intend to build these businesses by investing in organic growth and fillingstrategic gaps through acquisitions and partnershipsinvesting in organic growth we will not grow shortterm revenue at the

the merger was announced we began formulating our brandstrategy at first we thought we simply needed to decide whether to market our consumer productsunder the name of bank one or chase our research however produced intriguing results bothchase and bank one tested well but the research revealed that each has very different strengthsthe chase brand is associated with a tradition of trust that could extend to a broader array ofproducts and services such as insurance retirement products and investments the bank onebrand however is viewed as having momentum beginning in march  you will see the emergence of a new chase brand that combines the bestof both the trustworthiness of chase with the energy of bank one chase will be used to marketproducts and services offered by commercial banking card services and retail financial servicesthe reenergized brand will be introduced with a nationwide marketing campaign focusing initiallyon the chase family of credit cardsby the end of  our consumer business will be spending more than  billion annually in supportof one brand chase we intend to make chase the best brand in the consumer financial servicesindustry we are on track to have
