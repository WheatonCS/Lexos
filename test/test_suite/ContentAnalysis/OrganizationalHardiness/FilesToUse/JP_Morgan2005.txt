into operating and scale efficiencies increasedprofit margins stronger earnings and leadershippositions and the benefits of size can only be realizedwithin a culture that values teamwork

creating shareholder valueover time managements and boards have to manage with alongerterm outlook and resist the pressures of thequartertoquarter mindset of the market building the best performance culture in the industrywill ensure that all of the inherent potential of size isharvested and maximized relationships matter  with clients and with each otherinternally  and without them a firm will

are excited about our progress in  and our plans for the foundation for everything we are doing rests ona set of business principles that we believe when executedproperly create great companies these principles aredescribed on our web site wwwjpmorganchasecom inessence we strive to share with you the truth and offer honest assessmentsof our businesses and our prospects act with integrity and honor do the right thing not necessarily the easy orexpedient thing work hard and with fierce resolve to make this acompany of which our shareholders employeescustomers and communities can be proud focus relentlessly on the execution of our businessprinciplesthere are some specific issues that are integral to the successof our company i would like to address them byanswering the following questionsi are we in the right businessesii can we achieve outstanding performanceiii are we properly managing our risksiv do we have the right people and the rightcompensation strategyv are we a good corporate citizeni are we in the right businesseslet me unequivocally answer this question with a resoundingyes for three reasons each business is already wellpositioned  in terms of size and scope  within its specificindustry there is exceptional value in the linkages amongour businesses and the companys size scale and brands area competitive strengtheach business is already well positioned within itsspecific industryour six major lines of business  investment bankingcommercial banking retail financial services cardservices asset  wealth management and treasury securities services  all compete in consolidating industriesbusinesses consolidate when the vast economies of scale thatcan be achieved in systems operations distribution brandand rd to name a few will benefit the customerwe cannot underestimate the power of these economicforces nor can we ignore the inevitable impact they haveon our businesses but change is hard  and many whoattempt it fail the winners will be those who can providetheir customers with more access to better financial productsand services at a lower price in this environmentsize scale and staying power matter and all of our corebusinesses already have what it takes to succeed but as idiscuss later we must continue to improve our executionskills to distinguish our company in the marketplace ourbusinesses do not and will not want for capital or investmentthey are well equipped to survive in good and badtimes and our customers will continually benefit fromtheir stability and efficiency as well as the investments weare able to make in technology and innovationour businesses belong together and there isexceptional value in the linkages among themas separate entities our businesses are currently well positionedtogether they are even stronger putting our businessestogether makes sense only if doing so creates valuefor customers and ultimately shareholders it does notwork because we want it to  it only works because it givesthe customer more for less sooner rather than later wehave no interest in selling our customers products that theydo not want or needin this context the term crosssell can be misleadingcrossselling often carries negative connotations  as if itis a forced and unnatural act in fact it should be describedmore appropriately as natural productline extensionswhich businesses have been doing successfully for hundredsof years walmart has continually expanded the types ofproducts it sells twenty years ago who would havethought that it would sell lettuce and tomatoes theseproductline extensions are true also for home depot commercialbanks investment banks stockbrokers and evenmanufacturers ge aircraft engines now finances and serviceswhat it manufactures the essence of what makes thissuccessful is that the customer is the winnerby extending our product lines we are able to leverage thesubstantial investments we have made to build our distributionsystem eg branches technology and sales peoplestrengthen our brand and earn the trust of our customersfor example today our branches which are our retailstores not only accept deposits and provide access to cashbut also sell investments mortgages home equity loansdebit and credit cards and online bill paying services aswell as small business loans international funds transferspayroll services annuities etcour clear natural product set is financial services whichis what individuals and businesses want and expect from uswhere the products are manufactured is of little interestto them what is important to them and to us is ourability to provide a better product or package of productsat a lower cost our challenge is to view this from theirperspective and ensure that our collective resources arefocused accordinglyin addition to providing substantial potential for growthour mix of businesses presents us with fertile ground forinnovation here are a few examples of how our businessesare working togetherretail and card services the competitive advantage isformidable when our retail bank  which serves almost million households  joins forces with our credit cardcompany with its  million cardholders this collaborationshould result in excellent new products that addressspecific consumer needs for example we may be able tomake life much simpler for our customers by linking creditand debit cards and by offering them other products theresults of recent efforts are promising credit card sales inour retail branches are up nearly  from two years agocommercial banking and retail a strong connectionalready exists between our commercial bank and our retailbranches in fact there are few successful commercial banksin america that do not have a retail bank  and for goodreason a large share of retail business comes from smallbusinesses and midsized companies many use branches astheir financial back offices for cash payroll processing andwire transfer services this interdependency is cost effectivefor us and beneficial to our customers in addition businessaccounts often lead to new personal accounts and vice versainvestment banking and commercial banking a natural connectionexists between an investment bank which essentiallyserves large public companies and a commercialbank which essentially serves midsized to small publicand nonpublic companies our commercial bank alreadygenerates hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues fromoffering its clients traditional investment banking serviceseg advisory debt and equity underwriting over thenext few years we believe that we can double commercialbankings revenues from these activities in cities likeindianapolis austin denver and tucson  where ourinvestment bank does not have a physical presence  localbusinesses have strong relationships with our commercialbankers these bankers know when their clients are contemplatingtransactions and need access to investmentbanking expertise the connection is valuable for clientsand beneficial to us it enables our investment bank togenerate revenues from its product expertise that it couldnot have previously produced without the client relationshipand it enables the commercial bank to better serveits clients by providing them with the additional productsthat they needtreasury  securities services asset  wealth managementanother important connection exists between treasury securities services and our other businesses many of ourmajor customers institutional middle market small businessand retail use tss for activities such as cash checksach payments wire transfer and custody tss generatesapproximately  billion of annual revenue by serving thesecustomers asset  wealth management also benefits fromworking with other businesses including managing assetsfor corporate clients helping them meet their complex pensionand investment needs and offering products fromacross the company to individual clientsplenty of other examples exist but the critical pointremains while each business should do well on its own itshould also be able to capitalize on our companys extensiveand unique set of products and services to more fully andprofitably meet customer needs there is certainly no reasonwhy they should do worse because they are part of thisinstitution the key of course is that the customers mustbe the winnersthe size and scale of the company are a competitivestrengththe size scale and scope of jpmorgan chase also offer hugeadvantages economies of scale in operations and systemsdiversification of capital risk and earnings a great globalbrand and the capability to make large investments at alower cost of capital in particular the benefits of size andscale in operations and systems are vast and they are realour diversified earning streams lower our risk increase ourcredit ratings and reduce the cost of our capital and sinceone of our major costs is the cost of money the ability toraise funds cheaper better faster and more effectively aroundthe world than other companies is a major advantagebut size alone is not enough to win in fact if not properlymanaged it can bring many negatives huge companiesoperating in complex consolidating and fiercely competitiveindustries like ours can only achieve and sustain theirsuccess by competing where the rubber hits the road  atthe level of the store the product and the banker  not atcorporate headquarters we must equip those employees onthe front lines to be responsive and responsible the waywe manage our size will reflect how much we recognize andrespect this imperative bureaucracy and waste are lethalto remain healthy and vibrant we must constantly andconsistently minimize bureaucracy eliminate waste andinsist upon excellent executionii can we achieve outstanding performanceyes but we are not there yet good positioning does notassure great performance creating great performance is notmystical it takes consistent effort focus hard work anddisciplinethe starting point for us is to admit where we are anyway one analyzes our businesses for the most part our costsare too high our returns on capital are too low and ourgrowth is not what it could bewe are underperforming financially in many areas weneed to understand the reasons and focus our energy onmaking improvements not excuses we cannot afford towaste time justifying mediocrity each line of businessnow assesses its performance in a rigorous and very detailedway each compares results to targets in a variety of areasincluding sales force productivity customer service andsystems developmentit is not enough for the overall business to make its profittargets it would be unacceptable to achieve good financialreturns by reducing expenses that are critical investmentsfor the future or by compromising the quality of businessthat we do the best way to reach and sustain a higher levelof performance is to get every part of the business to stepup its game for example we have some businesses that ingeneral achieve adequate returns these results are oftenproduced when a few exceptional business segments do theheavy lifting for the rest we cannot use our strengths inone part of our business to subsidize our weaknesses inanother partwe spend a lot of time on capital and return on capitalhow we allocate capital should reflect our understanding ofhow changes in the economy  and the likely length andintensity of the cycles they cause  will affect specific partsof our business where will the risks and growth opportunitiesbe for example there will be another recession wejust do not know when what we do know however is thatwhen it happens our annual credit costs will increase substantiallytherefore when we talk about return on capitalwe must look at it through the cycle not just during thebest parts of the cyclemany companies that compete in our businesses have beenwell managed and able to produce excellent results fordecades we have every reason to be among them timewill tell if we are we have made progress but not enoughto get outstanding performance we must instill the followingdisciplines deep into the fiber of our companybecome lean and efficientthis is an imperative one cannot achieve great performancein fiercely competitive industries without beinglean and efficient it is irresponsible to waste our criticalresources on expenditures that have nothing to do withbetter serving our clients and building a great companywe need to use our resources to grow innovate markethire productive people and build systems it is not justabout cutting costs a company cannot become great justby cutting costs it is about building better systems to betterserve our customers it is about paying our people notonly fairly but effectively to help create the right behaviorit is about how we run meetings it is about designing theright products that are also profitable many companiesdesign products that lose money and they do not evenknow it it is about constantly improving productivitywe must continually ask ourselves can the same investmentin the same area be better spent does every businessstrive to get the most out of its resources the investmentbank for example has many businesses depending uponhow you measure it does each business spend its moneyefficiently and wisely are we spending the right amountin the right way and expecting the right results last yearwe spent over  billion in marketing to get  million newcredit card accounts can we spend more and get even betterresults we probably can this year we want to bothspend more and get more from every dollar we spendwhen we determine that we can and are spending moneywisely we will want to spend more not lesssince the merger we have realized  billion in mergersavings however much more is needed to achieve what wewould consider to be real efficiency this past year welaunched and completed major projects aimed at increasingour efficiency and improving our customer service over thelong run they include  completing the largest credit card conversion in historythis effort combined over  million heritage chase andbank one accounts onto a single platform and providedus with a single bestinclass system to better serve ourcustomers and at a lower cost integrating and upgrading all of our businesses intexas  in terms of products brand systems

newdata center the move increases our data storage capabilityenhances our resiliency reduces infrastructure pointsof failure and lowers overall cost to the firmover this next year we will continue to massivelyupgrade and streamline our systems and operationshighlights include converting and upgrading all of our operations in thenew york tristate market beginning in the secondquarter this will be one of the most visible bank conversionsin our industry and will have an impact on allof our businesses  specifically  million depositaccounts representing over  billion and involvesmore than  heritage chase branches and over teller workstations providing our retail and wholesale customers with uniforminternet platforms upgrading loan origination systemsand implementing a new mortgage servicing system substantially improving infrastructure including datacenters networks and financial management systemswe cannot build a great company unless we are unrelentingin our efforts to be a lean and efficient company this mustbecome a permanent part of our mindsetremove barriers to successas i mentioned before excessive bureaucracy is lethal itslows us down distracts us from our clients and demoralizesgood employees we must act with more openness passionand urgency the process of busting bureaucracy never endsbut what is different now is that our employees are engagedin challenging the system and solving the problemswe continue to attack bureaucracy and improve all aspectsof our management practices including accountability and decision making central to the changeswe have undertaken is the realignment of corporate staffnow embedded in the businesses are many of the stafffunctions  like finance and systems  that used to beconcentrated at the corporate level the realignment givesour businesses greater ability to manage their supportfunctions for staff better access to the businesses theysupport provides them with more knowledge and controlthe restructuring will lead to better accountabilitytransparency and reporting which in turn will improveexecution and overall corporate risk management management information and discipline it is hard to acton the truth if you do not know what it is we wantmanagers to have the tools and information to run theirbusinesses as if they owned them with this goal inmind we now produce thousands of increasingly accuratereports that provide managers with specific informationon their performance in addition we give themtools to proactively eliminate waste and manage theirresources better reporting has dramatically improvedthe effectiveness of our business review meetingswithout this information these meetings are often awaste of time they now are convened at many levels ofthe company and focus on where we are and need to berelative to our own benchmarks and the best performers in each business as a result of these discussions we areable to establish real targets for our businesses in termsof growth margins returns market share etc people practices we have rationalized human resourceprocesses by eliminating several unnecessary proceduresand personnel to place accountability for managing peoplesquarely where it belongs  with line managers forexample performance reviews have been revamped andsimplified training has been streamlined and executivecoaches have been eliminated we think coaching is themanagers job performance reviews should facilitatenot prevent meaningful honest and comprehensiveresultsoriented exchanges between managers and theirdirect reports yet over time the process grew to take ona life of its own and became a hindrance now the barriersare being removed in addition we have created aforum for discussion of our talent and made people managementgenerally and diversity in particular part of theagenda of senior manager meetings across the companywe remain devoted to our people and their developmentbut we will use management accountability notbureaucratic processes to prove it we want our peopleto communicate openly easily and constructivelyfocus resources where we can succeed and winwe have sold or liquidated several businesses that eitherdid not fit our strategy or did not contribute significantlyto our longterm success for these reasons we soldbrownco and businesses in manufactured housing andrecreational vehicles we also announced the sale of ourinsurance business and have dramatically reduced the size ofour auto leasing businessby discontinuing or reducing our commitment to ancillarybusinesses we availed ourselves of billions of dollars in capitalwe redeployed this capital in businesses where we canwin for example we invested in jpmorgan cazenove aninvestment banking joint venture in the united kingdomwhich already shows promising results expanded ourglobal trade management operations with the purchase ofvastera and acquired the sears canada privatelabel creditcard portfolio in addition we have recently completedthe purchase of a consumer educational loan businesscollegiate funding services that both processes andunderwrites loans these are all transactions that positionus for real growthwe have also freed up and redirected our capital to supportinnovation we want to make innovation part of our dnathis does not mean spending hundreds of millions ofdollars on failed ideas it does mean however that wewill take calculated risks knowing that some will failprogressive thinking should be reflected in every conversationevery analysis and every product and service weprovide we have many new products coming out this yearthat we think will fill this billthe ultimate goal create organic growthprofitable sustainable properly underwritten growth isnot a vision it is the result of excellent managementdiscipline an unrelenting focus on execution consistentmanagement of risk a competitive product set andoutstanding customer servicethe level of effort and expense associated with mergeractivities and systems consolidation has been predictablyhuge so the fact that we were able to absorb the impact and still cut costs and materially increase investment spending is a source of pride to all of us what is even moregratifying however is to see evidence of real growth inmost businesses something that is often a casualty inmerger consolidationsin  real growth  albeit not always great growth took place across the board retail increased its depositschecking accounts and credit cards commercial bankingachieved growth in leasing middle market lending and liabilitybalances treasury  securities services producedmore custody business and had growth in liability balancesasset  wealth management increased the level of assetsunder management card services had growth in new customerspartners card receivables and spending revenuesin the investment bank increased in ma assetbackedsecurities highyield bonds and energy tradingequally important we materially increased investmentin areas that will drive future growth specifics includespending hundreds of millions of dollars to open  newbranches this will drive growth in  and beyondadding more retail loan officers hiring additional privatebankers funding the buildout of our energy and mortgagetrading capabilities in the investment bank and investingin stateoftheart blink credit card technology whichenables customers to use credit cards for small paymentswithout having to sign anything now being piloted insix cities blink is an investment that has put us at the forefrontof changes in payment systems and card innovationin addition to making acrosstheboard investments tobuild our businesses we are making investments in ourinfrastructure that anticipate growth and prepare us tosuccessfully manage it for years to come in  weinvested over  billion in platform conversions includingthose for texas and card servicesby consolidating and improving platforms we are eliminatingthe inefficiencies and competitive disadvantagesassociated with multiple operating platforms in the processwe will create bestinclass platforms in many areas such asglobal cash clearing credit card retail branches and some ofour trading business we believe that longterm success isnot possible without great systems and operations they willdrive efficiency innovation and speed to market much ofthis will be accomplished by the end of iii are we properly managing our risksalmost all of our businesses are risktaking businesses and we spend a great deal of time thinking about allaspects and types of risk inherent in them including consumer and wholesale credit risk market and trading risk interest rate and liquidity risk reputation and legal risk operational and catastrophic riskthe notable fact about the first three risk areas is that theyare cyclical and all of them have elements of unpredictabilitythis requires us to be prepared for inevitable cycles acompany that properly manages itself in bad times is oftenthe winner for us sustaining our strength is a strategicimperative if we are strong during tough times  whenothers are weak  then the opportunities can be limitlessprotecting the company is paramount i will highlight thetypes of risks we focus on to give you a sense of the threatthey pose and how we plan for itconsumer and wholesale credit riskover the years our company has substantially reduced itswholesale credit exposure by using a disciplined process forextending credit and maximizing return on shareholdercapital in the consumer market we have controlled ourrisk by limiting the amount of lowprime and subprimecredit we issue in our card and other consumer businessesin addition we have decided at the expense of losing somevolume not to offer higherrisk lesstested loan productssuch as negatively amortizing option armswhile we are taking the right steps we estimate that ina recession consumer and wholesale credit costs couldpossibly get worse by more than  billion this dauntingreality requires us to be prepared and well protectedprotection  is having larger and more durable profits toabsorb the losses we are accomplishing this by increasingour margins virtually across the board protection  ismaintaining a fortress balance sheet we try to understandand manage every asset and every liability and make surethat someone is accountable for each one it also meansmaintaining as much as possible strong loan loss reservesfinally having a wellcapitalized firm is critical withtier  capital at  and total capital at  we believe weare there the important point is that we need to managethe business the balance sheet and the investments to earnadequate returns through the cycles and to be prepared forsurprises we do not want to realize high returns at the toponly to give them all back at the worst part of the cycle market and trading risk and interest rate andliquidity riskwe need to manage our riskreturn payoff better in in  our trading volatilities were unacceptably highthe  billion in trading revenues not a bad result on itsown was the result of two great quarters and two quarterswhere we underperformed we think that is too muchvolatility and reducing it is one of our priorities i believewe can accomplish this by continuing to diversify our tradingbusiness by being more disciplined and precise in theexecution of our risk management practices and by hiringand retaining the best talent we intend to deliver bettermore consistent results over time while maintaining ouraggregate risktaking appetitethe good news is that we have aggressively invested to generatemore diversified and consistent returns for example wehave added energy trading and increased our activities inmortgage and assetbacked securities and principal investingwe have leadership positions in credit markets and inour derivatives franchises and we will continue to invest inorder to sustain them and while in the short run some ofthis has actually increased volatility we are convinced thatour efforts  consistently applied  will succeed howeverwe caution our shareholders not to expect immediate resultsinterest rate exposure is another area in which financialservices companies can assume excess risk  often at greatperil as with underwriting credit good analysis of interestrate exposure is rooted in facts and evaluations that arebased upon a variety of realistic assumptions and scenarioswe devote substantial resources to understanding howinterest rate changes will affect our performance thisanalysis should be  and will be  an ongoing process webelieve that our company has carefully managed its interestrate risk so that even dramatic moves in rates of several percentagepoints cannot alone damage the companya healthy liquidity profile is essential to the ongoing viabilityof any company financial or otherwise we use a varietyof tools to maintain a strong liquidity position at theparent and subsidiary companies including stress scenarioscollateral management and a conservative debt structure forthe company overall we engage in a continual dialoguewith major rating agencies and we are focused on maintainingand improving our strong credit ratingsreputation and legal riskthe litigation costs in business are well known we areintensely focused on ways to safeguard the firms reputationand exposure they include senior management endorsement of a code of conductthat all employees must sign and adhere to as well as acommitment to provide appropriate training a strong and independent compliance program thatencourages employees to assist in surfacing complianceand ethical issues and identifying money laundering andterrorist financing activities a more robust due diligence process focused on securitiesunderwriting transactions where we have establishedcentralized oversight of our processes and standards a disciplined governance process to address conflicts andreview transactions that may present conflicts that couldharm the firm now or in the future a productive and open dialogue with our regulators andan ongoing emphasis on staying alert to changes in regulatorystandardswe believe that these actions will mitigate our exposurebut we recognize unfortunately that they will not eliminateit we have also implemented a disciplined process tocontinually review our liabilities and establish appropriatelitigation reserves while we make every effort to properlymanage the company to reduce litigation and legal costswe believe that our shareholders should assume that highlegal costs will continue for the foreseeable future theyshould be viewed unfortunately as simply a higher permanentcost of doing business than in the pastoperational and catastrophic riskthis year we also made progress in strengthening our operationalrisk management programs we have a consistentapproach across all businesses for defining and aggregatingour exposure to potential operational loss this approachhelps us determine whether we will be adequately capitalizedin the event of such a loss in addition to carefullymanaging operational risk we need to be prepared forunforeseen disasters catastrophic risk can take a variety offorms and significantly impair the performance and theoperations of the company we have formal disaster recoveryand contingency plans in place they worked well duringhurricane katrina and the bombings in london butwe must continue to refine them as new risks appearwhatever the type of risk the key point is that we try tohave a comprehensive approach to managing it thisrequires that the right people be in the right jobs and thatthere be clear accountability in each business for managingrisk in addition to rigorous corporate oversightiv do we have the right people and the rightcompensation strategyat the end of the day it all comes down to people we havegreat people in this company as i travel across the unitedstates and around the world i have become increasinglyimpressed with the talent and potential of our employeesrarely can a company assemble this level of creative firepowerand professional competenceto maximize the collective strength of our people we willneed to work better as a team great teams are not greatbecause they have star athletes great teams are greatbecause the players have learned how to work together andfocus their collective energy and talent on winning we arein the early stages of building a great teamthe compensation cycle was difficult but productive thisyear we are getting better at relating pay to performancebut there is still room for improvement increasingly wealso must orient ourselves to absolute performance against bestinclass targets not simply improvement in performancewe want to be clear and truthful when we rate ourselvesand fair as well as effective when evaluating performancegood performance goes beyond individual productivity toinclude group unit and company performance compensationis not an entitlement it should reflect an individuals and ateams contribution to helping make this a great companywe want to be one of the bestpaying companies  but onlywhen we are one of the bestperforming companieswe also want our employees to feel and act like ownerswhich is why stock is an important part of our compensationplans today more than  employees own orhave an option to own approximately  of shares in thecompany executive committee members are required toretain  of their stock awards as long as they are withthe company and in general stock options are awarded ona limited basiswe continually review our benefits programs to assure thatthey are of value to employees and cost effective for examplethe company has excellent medical benefits programsbut we subsidize them more for lowerpaid employees thanwe do for higherpaid employees i hope that this instills asense of pride in our managersin addition we no longer match highly paid employeesin their k they have adequate pensions we do notoffer perks to executives like club memberships financialplanning and leased cars we are reducing excessive executiveseverance plans but more importantly we are payingour employees more our thinking is simple  less compensationthrough entitlements more from performancewe want to pay more and let our employees spend whatthey earn as they see fitwe need to constantly remind ourselves that the mostimportant thing we can do for employees is to build ahealthy vibrant company that treats people with respectand creates opportunity morale is not based upon perksmorale builds from respect growth innovation and successfrom establishing a true meritocracy from the stock performingwell from customers liking to do business with usa great company will provide people with
