# Milestones

Milestones are used to split the text at designated spots such as chapters. 
Words that are used in the .txt shouldn't be used as milestones.
As seen in testing of catBobcat.txt and catCaterpillar.txt, if the word cat is used as a milestone every instance of it concatenated or not is removed.
