<h3 class="help-section-title">The Word Cloud Tool</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Word clouds are a method of visualizing the Document-Term Matrix. They
    present terms arranged at angles for compactness, with each term sized according
    to its frequency within the text. Word clouds enable you to get a sense of
    the content in your corpus, and they are very good for presentations. However,
    they also have some well-known limitations. In some languages, individual
    tokens may not correspond to words, which will limit the usefulness of this
    method of visualization.

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    The Lexos Word Cloud tool uses Jason Davies’ excellent
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jasondavies.com/wordcloud/"><u>word cloud generator for d3.js</u></a>
    — with a few modifications— to create beautiful, interactive word clouds.
    This implementation scales the size to ensure all terms fit within the layout.
    The color used for each does not convey meaning and is used only for aesthetic
    purposes.

<!-- Usage -->
<h3 class="help-section-title">Usage</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Lexos generates a word cloud using all your active documents. If you would
    like a word cloud for each of your documents, use the <a href="/multicloud"><u>Multicloud</u></a> tool.
    A word cloud will automatically be generated when you open the tool, but
    there are changes you can make to modify the visualization. <em><b>Note:</b>
    Large documents can take a while to generate so please be patient. </em>

<ul class="help-section-list" style="list-style-type: none">
    <li><b>Word Count</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Run your mouse cursor over a term to open a tooltip showing the number
        of times the term occurs in your selected document(s).

<!-- Options -->
<h3 class="help-section-title">Options</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Davies’ word cloud generator offers some useful ways to modify the layout
    using the controls below the graph. Each of the settings is described in
    detail below.
</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Remember to click "Generate" again to see your changes reflected in the
    word cloud.

<ul class="help-section-list" style="list-style-type: none">

    <li><b>Font</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        You can change the appearance of your word cloud by setting the font
        here. This feature should work with any font installed on your system.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Term Count</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        By default, Lexos includes the top 100 terms in your documents. Use
        this setting to modify the number. Limiting the number of terms may help
        you to include high frequency terms which are dropped by the layout algorithm.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Color</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        The default color scheme is Blue and Grey, but you can click here to
        select different colors for your visualization.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Download</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Word clouds are downloadable in either <code>.svg</code> or <code>.png</code>
        format. SVG images are very useful because they scale well in web browsers.
