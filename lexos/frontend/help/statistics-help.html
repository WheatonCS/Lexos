<h3 class="help-section-title">The Statistics Tool</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    The Lexos Statistics tool provides a basic overview of statistical content
    in your collection as an addition to the specific term counts/proportions
    available in the Document-Term Matrix (DTM) provided in
    <a href="/tokenize"><u>Tokenizer</u></a>.

<ul class="help-section-list" style="list-style-type: none">

    <li><b>Generate</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        The Statistics tool generates data based on all active documents. If you
        wish to only analyze specific documents, visit the <a href="/manage"><u>Manage</u></a>
        page. If you make changes to any of the following options, be sure to click
        the "Generate" button again to see your changes reflected in the results.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Tokenize</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        By default Lexos tokenizes by tokens, meaning it splits strings of text
        into tokens every time it encounters a space character. For Western languages,
        this means that each token generally corresponds to a word. To tokenize
        by multiple words, you can increase the n-gram size.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        For example given the text: "the dog ran" tokenizing by 1-gram tokens
        would produce tokens "the", "dog", "ran". Tokenizing by 2-grams would
        count the instances of bi-grams or pairs of words, thus producing tokens
        "the dog", "dog ran", and so on.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        If you wish to tokenize by characters, Lexos will treat every character
        (letters, whitespace, punctuation, etc.) as a separate token. Tokenizing
        by 2-gram characters would produce tokens "th","he","e ", and so on.
        Tokenizing by characters is best used for non-western languages that don't
        have whitespace between tokens such as classical Chinese.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Cull</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        "Culling" is a generic term we use for methods of decreasing the number
        of terms used to generate the DTM based on statistical criteria (as
        opposed to something like applying a stop-word list in Scrubber). Culling
        is optional to use in Lexos. Lexos offers two different methods:
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        "Use the top ___ words": This method takes a slice of the DTM
        containing only the top N most frequently occurring terms in the
        set of active documents. The default setting is 100, meaning
        Tokenizer will generate the DTM using only the top 100 most
        frequent terms.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        "Must be in ___ documents": This method build the DTM using only
        terms that occur in at least N documents. The default setting is
        1. If you have 10 active documents and you want to generate the
        DTM using only terms that appear in all your active documents,
        set the value to 10. <em><b>Note:</b> You can quickly determine
        the number of active documents in your workspace as indicated by
        the counter in the bottom right corner.</em>

            panning across the graph.</li>

    <li><b>Document Statistics</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Statistics generates a table containing the file name, the total term count,
        number of distinct terms, the vocabulary density (the distinct terms/the
        total terms), and the number of terms occurring once <i>(hapax legomena)</i> for
        each document (row). You may generate statistics on all of your active
        files or you may select a subset of your active documents by using the
        <a href="/manage"><u>Manage</u></a> page.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        To sort the table, click on a column header, and either "Ascending" or
        "Descending" at the top next to "Order". These results will display
        immediately, thus clicking "Generate" is not necessary to reflect these
        changes.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Corpus Statistics</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Lexos calculates the average, median, standard deviation, and interquartile
        range (IQR) of your documents' sizes (based on term counts). This
        information is used to determine if any of the document sizes are anomalously
        large or small, that is if any of your document sizes are outliers.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Standard Error Test</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        If a value is a certain number of standard deviations away from the mean,
        that data point is identified as an outlier. Thus using the standard
        error test, Lexos provides a anomaly warning for any document
        with a size that is particularly large or small compared to the rest of
        your corpus.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Inquartile Range Test</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Using the calculated IQR, Lexos provides a anomaly warning for any document
        with a size that is particularly large or small compared to the rest of
        your corpus. Outliers are those document sizes that fall below Q1 - 1.5(IQR)
        or above Q3 + 1.5(IQR).
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        You should consider removing outlier documents from subsequent
        analyses and/or consider additional cutting of some documents to make
        term counts more uniform.provides a anomaly warning for any document with

        The Document Sizes box plot is downloadable in either <code>.svg</code> or

        well in web browsers.

        To download the Document Statistics as a data file, click the "Download"
        button and you will get a results <code>.csv</code> file. “CSV” is short
        for Comma-Separated Values. In your downloaded file, a comma will serve
        as the column delimiter and these files can be opened by other programs
        later, e.g., Excel.
