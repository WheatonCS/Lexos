<h3 class="help-section-title">The Rolling Window Tool</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Rolling window analysis is a method for tracing the frequency of terms within
    a designated window of tokens over the course of a document. It can be used
    to identify small- and large-scale patterns of individual features or to compare
    these patterns for multiple features. Rolling window analysis tabulates term
    frequency as part of a continuously moving metric, rather than in discrete
    segments. Beginning with the selection of a window, say 100 tokens, rolling
    window analysis traces the frequency of a term's occurrence first within
    tokens 1-100, then 2 to 101, then 3, 102, and so on until the end of the
    document is reached. The result can be plotted as a line graph so that it
    is possible to observe gradual changes in a token’s frequency as the text
    progresses. Plotting different tokens on the same graph allows us to compare
    their frequencies.

<ul class="help-section-list" style="list-style-type: none">

    <li><b>Generate</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        After selecting the options described below click "Generate" to see your
        Rolling Windows graph. <em><b>Note:</b> The Rolling Windows tool requires
        that there is only one active document. Visit the <a href="/manage"><u>Manage</u></a> page
        to activate your desired document and deactivate the rest.</em>
    </h3>

    <li><b>Plotly Menu</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        If you pan over the graph, you'll notice that a menu appears in the top
        right corner.
        <ul class="help-section-list">

            <li>Zoom: This option allows you to click and drag to zoom in to a
            specific part of the graph.</li>

            <li>Pan: This option will change the click and drag function to
            panning across the graph.</li>

            <li>Zoom in and Zoom out: These will automatically zoom to the center
            of the graph.</li>

            <li>Auto-scale and Reset Axis: These options will zoom all the way out
            with the axis reset to fit the window</li>

            <li>Toggle spike lines: This option allows you to hover your mouse
            over data points and see where they are aligned on the x-axis and
            y-axis</li>

            <li>Show closest data on hover: If you hover over a data point,
            this option will show you the value of the data point (the average
            or ratio at that point in the window).</li>

            <li>Compare data on hover: If you hover over a data point, this
            option will show you the value of the data point and it's corresponding
            x-axis value (the location of the term in the token sequence
            (starting from 0), along with the average or ratio at that point in the window).</li>

        </ul>

    <li><b>Calculation Type</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Lexos will plot either the average term frequency in each window (Rolling
        Average) or the ratio of term frequencies if you are examining multiple terms
        (Rolling Ratio). If you choose Rolling Ratio, you must enter two terms
        (top / bottom); the plot will show the ratio of these terms in each window.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Search Terms</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        These are the terms you wish to plot from your document. Enter up to 6
        terms, separated by commas. When Lexos searches your document for these
        terms, it uses the document text, rather than the Document-Term Matrix
        (DTM) as its starting point. This means that you can choose to search
        for strings of text, individual words or terms (separated by spaces),
        or regular expressions (regex). A basic tutorial for using regex can be
        found at <a target="_blank" href="https://regexone.com/"><u>https://regexone.com/</u></a>.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        When searching for patterns as Strings, do not include extra spacing
        between your strings. For example, if you are searching for "il" and "on",
        enter the two strings to search for <em>without a space after the comma</em>,
        as follows: <code>il,on</code>. Again, when searching for multiple Strings,
        separate each string by only a comma with no whitespace. Any entered whitespace
        will be included in the search, probably not what you intended.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Window</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        This is where you set the size of the window you want to use. It can
        consist of any number of characters, tokens (separated by spaces), or lines
        (separated by line breaks in the text).
    </h3>

    <li><b>Display</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        If your document contains milestones, click the checkbox, enter your
        milestone, and the location of each milestone will be indicated on the
        rolling window graph by a vertical line.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        The Show Individual Points option (turned off by default) produces an
        uninterrupted line graph. Turning this option on will show the points where
        each term occurs in the document.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        The Black and White option  produces a non-color version of the graph
        that is suitable for downloading and publishing in journals.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Download</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        The Rolling Windows graph is downloadable in either <code>.svg</code> or
        <code>.png</code> format. SVG images are very useful because they scale
        well in web browsers.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        To download the graph as a data file, click the CSV button and you will get a
        results <code>.csv</code> file. “CSV” is short for Comma-Separated Values.
        In your downloaded file, a comma will serve as the column delimiter and
        these files can be opened by other programs later, e.g., Excel.
