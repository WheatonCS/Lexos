<!-- About Lexos -->
<h3 class="help-section-title">About Lexos</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Lexos is a web-based tool designed for transforming, analyzing, and visualizing
    texts. Lexos is designed for use primarily with small to medium-sized text
    collections, and especially for use with ancient languages and languages that
    do not employ the Latin alphabet. Lexos was created as an entry-level platform
    for Humanities scholars and students new to computational techniques while
    providing tools and techniques sophisticated enough for advanced research.

<!-- The Lexomics Workflow -->
<h3 class="help-section-title">The Lexomics Workflow</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Keeping track of your experimental methods is important. It is also challenging
    to sufficiently document experimental steps and decisions so that future
    readers and experimenters can reproduce published results. Our workflow is
    an attempt to share effective practices that make one's choices intentional.
    When we openly share our methods, data, and workflow, we submit that we
    facilitate the replication of results
    (<a target="_blank" href="https://dh2017.adho.org/abstracts/027/027.pdf">LeBlanc, 2017</a>).

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    We call Lexos "An Integrated Lexomics Workflow" because it brings together
    many of the processing steps we in the Lexomics project regularly perform in
    our research. Some history of the Lexomics project may give some useful
    perspective on what we mean by a workflow. When the Lexomics project began,
    it consisted of three simple PERL scripts: one to clean-up texts, one to cut
    them, and one to perform cluster analysis on them. Each script had to be run
    in sequence. So, after a while, it made sense to create a single tool that
    would guide the user from one to the next. It then became clear the tool's
    interface could allow the user to go back to earlier steps, tweak the settings,
    and then repeat their experiments. There were, in fact, many ways in which
    a user could design experiments using a single tool, and the tool could help
    the user manage their activities and, perhaps more importantly, to think
    critically about their process. Thus was Lexos born.

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    While the strictly linear steps of its origins are no longer the only possible
    approaches you can adopt when using Lexos, they provided important insight
    into how computational text analysis workflows are constructed. They essentially
    have three basic steps: pre-processing (scrubbing, segmenting), analysis,
    and visualization. It is not always possible to clearly separate these activities.
    Even in our earliest scripts, the first two were pre-processing steps and
    the last, which plotted a tree diagram of the cluster analysis, combined
    analysis and visualization. But, as Lexos has developed, we have tried to
    make this its organizing principle, encouraging the user to proceed from
    text preparation to simple visualization of their data to more complex
    analysis. This is particularly useful for entry-level users and those whose
    training has not explored the issues raised by computational methods.
    Lexos is thus designed to enable newcomers to the field to adopt the Lexomics
    workflow, empowering them to do sophisticated work in relatively little time.

    Following an effective workflow helps you document your computational
    methods so others can replicate your results.

<!-- How to Run Lexos -->
<h3 class="help-section-title">How to Run Lexos</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Lexos runs through your web browser and currently supports Google Chrome
    and Mozilla Firefox; other browsers may not function properly.
</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    There are two modes of running Lexos:

    <ol class="help-section-list">

        <li><b>Recommended:</b> Use our public server hosted by the Lexomics
            project at <a href="http://lexos.wheatoncollege.edu/">http://lexos.wheatoncollege.edu/</a>.
            This is your best first step. The limitations of the public server:
            (i) if you are leading a classroom of 10+ users, your response times
            may be slow, and (ii) uploading many and/or large text files may result
            in slow response times. <em><b>Note:</b> The public server has a single
            file size limit set at 250 MB (as of August 2018, v3.2.0).</em> For
            comparison sake, the novel <em>War and Peace</em> is 3.2M,
            <em>El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha</em> is 2.1M, and
            <em>Moby Dick</em> is 1.2MB; 250MB is the size of nine Webster's
            Unabridged Dictionaries.</li>

        <li><b>Power Users:</b>
            <a target="_blank" href="http://wheatoncollege.edu/lexomics/lexos-installers/"><u>Download and Install Lexos</u></a>.
            This method requires you to install the Python programming language
            on your computer and the open-source software for Lexos on github.
            Once installed, you can run Lexos locally using your browser.</li>

    </ol>

</h3>

<!-- Using Local Mode -->
<h3 class="help-section-title">Using Local Mode</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Many functions in Lexos are based on common Javascript libraries like jQuery
    and Twitter Bootstrap, which are employed all over the internet. So, chances
    are that your browser has cached these libraries already and doesn't need to
    load them, which makes loading times much faster. But we can't rely on it.
    So, even if you are running Lexos on your own computer using localhost, Lexos
    still requires an active internet connection to download these Javascript
    libraries. Most of the time, this is not an issue.
</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    But what if you don't have an internet connection? You can still run Lexos
    locally on your computer. Lexos has all the Javascript libraries built in and
    will switch to them if you put it in "local mode". All you have to do is find
    the Lexos folder on your computer and open the file <code>config.cfg</code> in a text editor.
    Change <code>LOCAL_MODE = False</code> to <code>LOCAL_MODE = True</code>
    (be careful, it is case sensitive); then save the file. You can ignore the
    other settings. If you are already running Lexos, quit form it by typing
    <code>Control+C</code> on the command line and then restart it by typing
    <code>python run.py</code>. (See the
    <a target="_blank" href="http://wheatoncollege.edu/lexomics/lexos-installers/">Manual Installation instructions</a>
    on the Lexomics website if you need help with this.) You will now be running
    in local mode.
