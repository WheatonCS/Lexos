<h3 class="help-section-title">The Content Analysis Tool</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    The Lexos Content Analysis Tool allows you to compare the presence of words
    in multiple dictionaries (lists of words) as found within your uploaded documents.
    The words in each dictionary are tallied for each document. You can then build
    your own equation to compute a single score for each document based on the
    words found in each dictionary. For example, if you have previously uploaded
    a document containing a concatenated list of tweets, you can use this tool
    to upload two dictionaries (e.g. happyWords.txt and sadWords.txt), then build
    an equation such as [happy] - [sad]. Given this equation, the tool will compute
    the total number of happy words found minus the total number of sad words found
    for each document. Once you click the Analyze button, a final score will emerge
    to indicate a "happiness" measure for your collection of tweets.
</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    There are various applications of the content analysis tool such as opinion
    mining, determining organizational hardiness in stockbroker reports, and sentiment analysis.

    <li><b>Formula</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Using the buttons as a regular calculator, and the new dictionary buttons,
        enter a formula for analysis. For example [happy]-[sad]

<ul class="help-section-list" style="list-style-type: none">

    <li><b>Overview</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Assuming a use with happy and sad dictionaries, the first table displays
        the number of happy and sad terms present in each document, the final formula
        value computed, the total word count of each document, and the score which
        is the formula result divided by the total word count. The average for each
        of these categories is also included in the table.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Corpus</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        The second table displays a ranking of the most frequently occurring dictionary
        terms for the entire corpus (the entire collection of active documents).
        For each dictionary term, the columns show the dictionary holding the term,
        the dictionary term, and the raw count of the number of times that term
        appears in the entire corpus. Each user-defined dictionary is color-coded
        for convenience.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Documents</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        The third table displays a ranking of the most frequently occurring dictionary
        terms for each document in the set of active documents. For each dictionary term,
        the columns show the dictionary holding the term, the dictionary term, and
        the raw count of the number of times that term appears in the document.

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    <em>Sentiment Analysis</em>: After uploading and preparing one or more text
    files (e.g., a novel), you must then upload at least one of your own user-defined
    dictionaries containing keywords that you tend to associate with a particular
    feeling. This "dictionary" is another text file uploaded under the dictionaries
    menu in the Content Analysis page. You must then enter a formula using the
    provided calculator in order to determine the “sentiment” of the text. For
    instance, you may choose to upload a novel and then two of your own user-defined
    dictionaries in order to determine the tone of the literary text.
</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Text File: happy very happy happy very sad sad happy happy happy sad <br>
    Dictionary 1: happy, very happy <br>
    Dictionary 2: sad, very sad <br>
    Formula: [happy] – [sad]
</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    After clicking analyze, you might see that the text appears to have a happier
    tone since it uses more phrases from Dictionary 1 (the “happy” dictionary)
    than from Dictionary 2 (the “sad” dictionary).
