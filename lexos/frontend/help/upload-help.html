<!-- The Upload Tool -->
<h3 class="help-section-title">The Upload Tool</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Upload is the standard starting point for the Lexos workflow. When you
    begin a new session or reset your workspace, you will be automatically
    redirected to Upload.
</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Note: Lexos supports only the Chrome and Firefox browsers.

<!-- Usage -->
<h3 class="help-section-title">Usage</h3>

<ul class="help-section-list" style="list-style-type:none;">

    <li><b>Upload Files</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Drag your document files into the box labeled "Drag Files Here", or
        click the "Browse" button to use the file browser to locate your
        files. Most browsers will allow you to shift- or control-click to select
        multiple files.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Accepted File Types</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Lexos accepts files as represented with filename (dot) extensions of:
        <code>.txt</code>, <code>.html</code>, <code>.xml</code>, <code>.sgml</code>,
        or <code>.lexos</code> (Lexos workspace files, see below). Make sure that your
        filenames use these file extensions.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Maximum File Size</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        There are some restrictions on file upload size in order to prevent the
        browser from hanging. Upload times may be slow for large files,
        particularly if you are working over the internet. The maximum file size
        of 250MB is approximately the size of nine Webster's Unabridged
        Dictionaries. If you experience a problem, try uploading smaller files,
        or, if you are uploading many files, try uploading them in smaller
        batches.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Upload List</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Once you have selected your files, they will begin to upload, one at a
        time. As each upload is complete, you will see the document names appear
        in the "Upload List" at the bottom of the page. The bigger the file the
        longer it will take to upload and show up on the page. After uploading is
        complete, each file is considered a document by Lexos. You can activate,
        de-activate, and re-label, and classify your documents using the
        <u><a href="/manage">Manage</a></u> tool.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Character Encoding</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Lexos will automatically convert all files to UTF-8 character encoding.
        If you are uploading <code>.html</code>, <code>.xml</code>, or <code>.sgml</code>
        files that contain special characters, the <a href="/scrub"><u>Scrubber</u></a> tool
        will help you to convert them to UTF-8 characters. If you are using raw
        text files (<code>.txt</code>), we recommend that you "Save-As" a copy of
        your files with UTF-8 encoding (and Unix line breaks) prior to uploading to
        Lexos (for example, using BBedit on MacOS, or NotePad++ on Windows).
    </h3>

<!-- Saving .lexos Workspace Files -->
<h3 class="help-section-title">Saving .lexos Workspace files</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Lexos does not permanently save your files on our server; however, Lexos
    allows you to save and download your workspace (files, options, etc.) for
    later use. For example, perhaps you have uploaded 10 files and scrubbed
    them with certain parameters. You can save your Workspace by clicking "Save"
    in the upper right corner which will download a file with a <code>.lexos</code>
    filename extension. Upon returning to Lexos, rather that re-uploading and
    scrubbing your files again, you can Upload your <code>.lexos</code> file.
    Your working state will be restored for subsequent work.
</h3>

<!-- The Lexos Web Scraper -->
<h3 class="help-section-title">The Lexos Web Scraper</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    At present, your documents must be available as files on your computer.
    However, Lexos has a web scraper tool, which allows you to download files
    off the internet. This is especially useful when you are using files from
    sources such as
    <u><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a></u>.
    Enter the URL you wish to scrape  in the provided field and click the "Scrape",
    this will download all the HTML markup in a web page (the HTML tags can be
    removed using the Scrubber tool). Upload times may vary, depending on internet
    speeds. If the process seems to hang, try uploading fewer URLs. Large-scale
    web scraping should not be done in Lexos.
