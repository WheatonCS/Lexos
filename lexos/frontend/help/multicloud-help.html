<h3 class="help-section-title">The Multicloud Tool</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    See the <a href="/word-cloud"><u>Word Cloud</u></a> tool to learn about what
    a word cloud is and how Lexos generates them. The Lexos Multicloud tool allows
    you to use word clouds to generate a comparative visualization of your documents.
    Each document has a separate word cloud, displayed in a grid that allows you
    to “eyeball” similarities and differences between the proportions of terms
    in each document.
</h3>

<!-- Usage -->
<h3 class="help-section-title">Usage</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    All active documents will be used to generate the multiclouds. Please
    keep in mind that generating multiclouds is computationally intensive
    and may take a very long time if you are generating a large number of
    clouds. Your browser may hang for some time. Please be patient.
</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Because the word clouds are necessarily small, they may not always be easy
    to interpret. If you find interesting documents using the Multicloud tool, it is
    recommended that you also generate larger clouds of each individual document
    using the <a href="/word-cloud"><u>Word Cloud</u></a> tool. Before returning
    to the Word Cloud tool to investigate a single document, make sure it is the
    only active document.

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Davies’ word cloud generator offers some useful ways to modify the layout
    using the controls below the graph. Each of the settings is described in
    detail below:

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Remember to click "Generate" again to see your changes reflected in the
    word clouds.

    <li><b>Font</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        You can change the appearance of your word cloud by setting the font
        here. This feature should work with any font installed on your system.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Term Count</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        By default, Lexos includes the top 100 terms in your documents. Use
        this setting to modify the number. Limiting the number of terms may help
        you to include high frequency terms which are dropped by the layout algorithm.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Color</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        The default color scheme is Blue and Grey, but you can click here to
        select different colors for your visualization.

    <li><b>Download</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        MultiClouds are downloadable in either <code>.svg</code> or <code>.png</code>
        format. SVG images are very useful because they scale well in web browsers.
