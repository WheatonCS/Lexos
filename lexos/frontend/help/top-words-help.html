<h3 class="help-section-title">The Top Words Tool</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    The Lexos Topwords tool helps you find terms that are more prominent in a
    certain document or class of documents than in other documents or classes of
    documents. We call these highly prominent terms "topwords" (even when the
    terms may not, strictly speaking, be "words".) The Topwords tool uses a
    Z-test to determine which terms are outliers beyond the normal range of
    distribution in a document or a group of documents. Our experience shows
    that the prominent terms you identify here in Topwords make good candidates
    for further analysis using the Lexos <a href="/rolling-window"><u>Rolling Windows</u></a> tool.

    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">

        <ul class="help-section-list">

            <li>Each document to the corpus: If you have not set any class labels
                on the Manage page, Topwords will, by default, compare each document
                to all the other active documents in your workspace.</li>

            <li>Each document to other classes: Allows you to compare the proportion
                of each term in a document within one class to their proportions
                in another class as a whole</li>

            <li>Each class to other classes: Allows you to the proportion of each
                term in one class to their proportions in another class. Lexos
                performs the analysis on all terms that appear at least once in
                the corpus</li>

        </ul>
    </h3>

    <li><b>Class Divisions</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Topwords uses the power of class labels. In the <a href="/manage"><u>Manage</u></a>
        tool, you can right-click and set a class label on an individual document
        or group of documents. For example, you might set the class of a group
        of documents with the same author to the author’s name or label documents
        by genre, and so on. If you do not assign class labels to your active
        documents, Topwords will only allow you to compare each document to the
        corpus (all active documents).
    </h3>

    <li><b>Tokenize</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        By default Lexos tokenizes by tokens, meaning it splits strings of text
        into tokens every time it encounters a space character. For Western languages,
        this means that each token generally corresponds to a word. To tokenize
        by multiple words, you can increase the n-gram size.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        For example given the text: "the dog ran" tokenizing by 1-gram tokens
        would produce tokens "the", "dog", "ran". Tokenizing by 2-grams would
        count the instances of bi-grams or pairs of words, thus producing tokens
        "the dog", "dog ran", and so on.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        If you wish to tokenize by characters, Lexos will treat every character
        (letters, whitespace, punctuation, etc.) as a separate token. Tokenizing
        by 2-gram characters would produce tokens "th","he","e ", and so on.
        Tokenizing by characters is best used for non-western languages that don't
        have whitespace between tokens such as classical Chinese.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Cull</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        "Culling" is a generic term we use for methods of decreasing the number
        of terms used to generate the DTM based on statistical criteria (as
        opposed to something like applying a stop-word list in Scrubber). Culling
        is optional to use in Lexos. Lexos offers two different methods:
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        "Use the top ___ words": This method takes a slice of the DTM
        containing only the top N most frequently occurring terms in the
        set of active documents. The default setting is 100, meaning
        Tokenizer will generate the DTM using only the top 100 most
        frequent terms.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        "Must be in ___ documents": This method build the DTM using only
        terms that occur in at least N documents. The default setting is
        1. If you have 10 active documents and you want to generate the
        DTM using only terms that appear in all your active documents,
        set the value to 10. <em><b>Note:</b> You can quickly determine
        the number of active documents in your workspace as indicated by
        the counter in the bottom right corner.</em>

    <li><b>Top Words</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Topwords produces a series of tables, each showing a different comparison
        (labeled at the top of the table). For example, Document "A" compares to
        Document "B". Within each table, the terms are ranked according to their
        Z-score. Only the top 30 statistically significant terms are shown
        (those for which the Z-score has an absolute value larger than 1.96).
        If a term has a larger positive z-score, the term is used more frequently
        in document or class “A” relative to document or class “B”. If a term has
        a larger negative z-score, the term is used more frequently in document
        or class “B” relative to “A”

        To download the result click the "CSV" button and you will get a
        results <code>.csv</code> file. “CSV” is short for Comma-Separated Values.
        In your downloaded file, a comma will serve as the column delimiter and
        these files can be opened by other programs later, e.g., Excel.
