<h3 class="help-section-title">The K-Means Clustering Tool</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    K-Means clustering partitions a set of documents into a number of groups or
    clusters in a way that minimizes the variation within clusters. The "K"
    refers to the number of partitions, so for example, if you wish to see how
    your documents might cluster into three (3) groups, you would set K=3.

<ul class="help-section-list" style="list-style-type: none">

    <li><b>Clusters</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Lexos will automatically generate a k-means graph with a default number
        of clusters, but you can also assign a K value for how many groups you
        want to cluster your documents in to. There is no obvious way to choose
        the number of clusters. It can be helpful to perform <a href="//dendrogram"><u>hierarchical clustering</u></a>
        before performing K-Means clustering, as the resulting dendrogram may
        suggest a certain number of clusters that is likely to produce meaningful
        results. The K-means procedure is very sensitive to the position of the
        initial seeds, although employing the K-means++ setting can help to
        constrain this placement.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Visualization</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Lexos provides three methods of visualizing the results of a K-means
        cluster analysis. In each case, Lexos first applies PCA (Principal
        Component Analysis) to reduce the dimensions of the data so it can be
        viewed in a 2-D or 3-D graph.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        <ul class="help-section-list">
            <li>Voronoi: This is the default method of visualization which
                identifies a centroid (central point) in each cluster and draws
                a trapezoidal polygon around it. This may be helpful in allowing
                you to see which points fall into which cluster.</li>

            <li>2D-Scatter: K-means viewed as a traditional 2-D scatter plot
            with each cluster as a data point</li>

            <li>2D-Scatter: K-means viewed as a traditional 3-D scatter plot
            with each cluster as a data point</li>
        </ul>
    </h3>

    <li><b>Advanced</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        <ul class="help-section-list">
            <li>Method of initialization: "K-Means++" selects initial cluster
                centers using a weighted probability distribution to speed up
                convergence. The "Random" option chooses K observations at random
                from the data to serve as the initial centroids.</li>

            <li>Maximum iterations: Maximum number of iterations of the K-Means
                algorithm for a single run. The default is 300.</li>

            <li>Different centroids: The number of times (N) the k-means algorithm
                will be run with different centroid seeds. The final results will
                be the best output of those N consecutive runs. (The default is 10.)</li>

            <li>Relative tolerance: Decimal, relative tolerance with respect to
                inertia to declare convergence.</li>
        </ul>
    </h3>

    <li><b>Tokenize</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        By default Lexos tokenizes by tokens, meaning it splits strings of text
        into tokens every time it encounters a space character. For Western languages,
        this means that each token generally corresponds to a word. To tokenize
        by multiple words, you can increase the n-gram size.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        For example given the text: "the dog ran" tokenizing by 1-gram tokens
        would produce tokens "the", "dog", "ran". Tokenizing by 2-grams would
        count the instances of bi-grams or pairs of words, thus producing tokens
        "the dog", "dog ran", and so on.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        If you wish to tokenize by characters, Lexos will treat every character
        (letters, whitespace, punctuation, etc.) as a separate token. Tokenizing
        by 2-gram characters would produce tokens "th","he","e ", and so on.
        Tokenizing by characters is best used for non-western languages that don't
        have whitespace between tokens such as classical Chinese.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Normalize</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        The default "Normalize" setting is "Proportional" which displays the
        frequency of the occurrence of terms in your documents as a proportion
        of the entire text.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        "Raw Counts" will display in the table the actual number of occurrences
        of each term in each document.
    </h3>
        <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        "TF-IDF" or Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency attempts to
        take into account difference in the lengths of your documents by
        calculating their TF-IDF. Lexos uses base<em>e</em> (natural log) as the
        default.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Cull</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        "Culling" is a generic term we use for methods of decreasing the number
        of terms used to generate the DTM based on statistical criteria (as
        opposed to something like applying a stop-word list in Scrubber). Culling
        is optional to use in Lexos. Lexos offers two different methods:
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        "Use the top ___ words": This method takes a slice of the DTM
        containing only the top N most frequently occurring terms in the
        set of active documents. The default setting is 100, meaning
        Tokenizer will generate the DTM using only the top 100 most
        frequent terms.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        "Must be in ___ documents": This method build the DTM using only
        terms that occur in at least N documents. The default setting is
        1. If you have 10 active documents and you want to generate the
        DTM using only terms that appear in all your active documents,
        set the value to 10. <em><b>Note:</b> You can quickly determine
        the number of active documents in your workspace as indicated by
        the counter in the bottom right corner.</em>

    <li><b>K-Means graph</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        When considering visualizations of K-means clusters, we recommend that
        you think of each of your documents as represented by a single (x,y)
        point on a two-dimensional coordinate plane. In this view, a cluster is
        a collection of documents (points) that are close to one another and
        together form a group. Assigning documents to a specific cluster amounts
        to determining which cluster "center" is closest to your document.
    </h3>

    <li><b>The K-Means Algorithm</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        The algorithm (general procedure or "recipe") for applying K-means to
        your collection of documents is described next. Again, the overall goal
        is to partition your documents into K non-empty subsets.

            <li>Decide on the number of clusters you wish to form.</li>
            <li>The algorithm will compute a "center" or centroid for each cluster.
                The centroid is the center (mean point) of a cluster. The procedure
                for creating centroids at the very start can be varied and is
                discussed below.</li>
            <li>Assign each of your documents to the cluster with the nearest centroid.</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 2 and 3, thereby re-calculating the locations of
                centroids for the documents in each cluster and reassigning documents
                to the cluster with the closest center. The algorithm continues
                until no documents are reassigned to different clusters.</li>

            with the axis reset to fit the window</li>

            <li>Toggle spike lines: This option allows you to hover your mouse
            over data points and see where they are aligned on the x-axis and
            y-axis</li>

            <li>Show closest data on hover: If you hover over a data point,

            x-axis value.</li>

            <li>When you enable the 3-D scatter plot, there are other options that
