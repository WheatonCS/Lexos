<h3 class="help-section-title">The Scrubber Tool</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Pre-processing your texts, what we refer to as "scrubbing", is a critical
    step when probing digitized texts and is a primary step in the Lexos workflow.
    In order to facilitate a conscious consideration of the many small decisions
    required, scrubbing options are isolated into individual choices. If for
    no other reason, your careful deliberation and choice of the many options
    during scrubbing facilitates replication of your analyses in the future,
    both by you and others who wish to replicate your experimental results.
</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    <b><em>Scrubbing affects all active documents and cannot be undone.</em></b>
    So make sure to de-activate any documents you do not wish to scrub using
    the <u><a href="http://lexos3.wheatoncollege.edu/manage">Manage</a></u>
    tool. If you apply scrubbing and later wish to revert to the un-scrubbed
    version, you will have to upload another copy to Lexos.

<!-- Usage -->
<h3 class="help-section-title">Usage</h3>

<ul class="help-section-list" style="list-style-type: none">

    <li><b>Preview and Apply</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        The "Preview" button allows you to view your options without
        permanently saving the changes. At this point, only the beginning and
        end of each document is displayed, separated by ellipses (…). When
        you are satisfied that you have achieved the desired effect, click the
        "Apply" button. Your documents will be scrubbed, and the scrubbed
        versions will be used by all the other Lexos tools.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Download</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        The "Download" button allows you to download the scrubbed versions of
        your files. A <code>.zip</code> folder of your scrubbed versions will
        be downloaded. Downloading scrubbed files can facilitate future analyses
        by uploading the previous scrubbed versions, allowing you to skip the
        scrubbing step and ensuring that your analyses are based on the
        same scrubbing options.
    </h3>

</ul>

<!-- Options -->
<h3 class="help-section-title">Options</h3>

<ul class="help-section-list" style="list-style-type: none">

    <li><b>Remove <u><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">Project Gutenberg</a></u> boilerplate material</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        If you have uploaded a file from the Project Gutenberg website without
        removing the boilerplate material (i.e., text added by the
        Project Gutenberg site at the top and license material at the end of
        the text), you will receive a warning.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        If you select the "Apply" button without removing
        this extra text, Lexos will attempt to remove the Project Gutenberg
        boilerplate material at the top and end of the file. However, we
        suggest you remove the boilerplate material using a text editor before
        uploading it to Lexos in order to prevent unwanted text from being
        included in subsequent analyses (e.g. including Project Gutenberg
        licensure material in your word counts) due to the inconsistency of
        the boilerplate format.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Make Lowercase</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Converts all uppercase characters to lowercase characters so that the
        tokens "The" and "the" will be considered as the same term. In addition,
        all contents (whether in uploaded files or entered manually) for the
        Stop Words/Keep Words, Lemmas, Consolidations, or Special Characters
        options will also have all uppercase characters changed to lowercase.
        Lowercase is not applied inside any <code>HTML</code>, <code>XML</code>,
        or <code>SGML</code> markup tags remaining in the text.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Remove Digits</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Removes all signed and unsigned number characters from the text,
        including decimal and delimiter separated values such as "3,123.40",
        "3.123,40", etc... Similar to the handling of punctuation marks, any
        Unicode character in each of the active texts with a "Number Character
        Property" is removed. For example, this option will remove a Chinese
        three (㈢) and Eastern Arabic six (۶) from the text. Note: This feature
        does not remove currency symbols, and will also modify some tokens in
        which digits appear. Remove Digits is not applied inside any
        <code>HTML</code>, <code>XML</code>, or <code>SGML</code> markup tags
        remaining in the text.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Remove Whitespace</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        <ul class="help-section-list">
            <li>Remove Spaces: each blank space will be removed.</li>
            <li>Remove Tabs: each tab character <code>\t</code> wil be removed.</li>
            <li>Remove Line Break: each newline character <code>\n</code> and carriage return
            character <code>\r</code>  will be removed.</li>
        </ul>
        Remove Whitespace is not applied inside any <code>HTML</code>,
        <code>XML</code>, or <code>SGML</code> markup tags remaining in the text.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Removing whitespace characters may be useful when you are working with
        languages such as Chinese that do not use whitespace for word boundaries.
        In addition, this option may be desired when tokenizing by character
        n-grams if you do not want spaces to be part of your n-grams. See the
        section on <u>Tokenization</u> for further discussion on tokenizing by
        character n-grams
    </h3>

    <li><b>Scrub Tags</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Handles markup tags in angular brackets, such as those used in
        <code>HTML</code>, <code>XML</code>, or <code>SGML</code>. In markup
        languages like these, start and end tags like
        <code>&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;</code> are used to designate an "element".
        Elements may be modified by "attributes" specified inside the start tag.
        For instance, a text using the the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)
        specification for XML might contain the markup
        <code>&lt;p rend=&quot;italic&quot;&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;</code>
        for a paragraph in italics.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        When "Scrub Tags" is selected, you may click "[Options]" to open the
        tag scrubbing dialog. This will allow you to choose one of four options
        to handle each type of tag or to handle all the tags at once:
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        <ul class="help-section-list">
            <li>Remove Tag: Removes the start and end tags but keeps the content in between.</li>
            <li>Remove All: Removes the start and end tags and all the content in between.</li>
            <li>Replace: Replaces the start and end tags as well as all of the content between
                with whatever you place in the "Replacement" text field. </li>
            <li>None: This option will leave the specified element untouched in the text.
                This is especially useful if you want to scrub other markup tags. </li>
        </ul>
        <b>Troubleshooting note:</b> Lexos will only scrub lowercase tags. As
        a result, the Lexos scrubbing function will miss <code>HTML</code>
        (and <code>SGML</code>) tags that contain uppercase letters. In this
        case, you may have to check each of the tags Lexos finds to make sure
        it does not have uppercase letters in your original document. If you find
        that Lexos is not scrubbing tags containing capital letters, you will
        have to change these in an editor before uploading the files. This issue
        does not affect valid <code>XML</code> files since <code>XML</code>
        parsers are case sensitive.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Remove Punctuation</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Lexos assumes that uploaded files may be in any language and automatically
        converts them to
        <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode"><u>Unicode</u></a>
        using
        <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8"><u>UTF-8 Character encoding</u></a>.
        This enables Lexos to recognize punctuation marks from a wide variety of languages.
        If the "Remove All Punctuation" option is selected, Lexos will remove
        any Unicode Punctuation Character and any Unicode Symbol Character in each
        of the active texts.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        If "Remove All Punctuation" is selected, three additional sub-options are available:
        <ul class="help-section-list">
            <li>Keep Hyphens: Selecting this option will change all variations of
                Unicode hyphens to a single type of hyphen ("-") and this will
                be left in the text. Hyphenated words will be subsequently
                treated as a single token (e.g., <em>computer-aided</em> becomes
                <em>computeraided</em>).</li>
            <li>Keep Apostrophes:  If this option is selected, apostrophes will
                be retained in contractions (e.g. <em>can’t</em>) and possessives
                (e.g. <em>Scott’s</em>), but not those in plural possessives (<em>students’</em>
                becomes the term <em>students</em>) nor those that appear at the start
                of a token (<em>'bout</em> becomes the term <em>bout</em>).</li>
            <li>Keep Ampersands: This option will not treat ampersands as
                punctuation marks and will retain them in the text. Note that
                <code>HTML</code>, <code>XML</code>, and <code>SGML</code>
                entities such as <code>&amp;aelig</code> (æ) are handled separately. You can
                choose how to convert these entities to standard Unicode characters
                using the Special Characters option described below in
                <em><u>Additional Options</u></em>. </li>
        </ul>
    </h3>
</ul>

<!-- Additional Options -->
<h3 class="help-section-title">Additional Options</h3>

<ul class="help-section-list" style="list-style-type: none">

    <li><b>Stop Words and Keep Words</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        You may upload a list of words (e.g. <code></code>stopWords.txt</code>) or manually enter
        a list of words as either comma-separated or line-separated as seen below:
        <pre>a, some, that, the, which</pre>
        OR
        <pre>a <br>some <br>that <br>the <br>which</pre>
        "Stop Words" represents a list of words or terms to remove from your
        documents, and "Keep Words" represents a list of words or terms that
        should remain in your documents with all other words removed. Note that
        the "Make Lowercase" option will be applied to your list of stop/keep
        words if that option is also selected.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        <b><em>For information on pre-assembled stop word lists, see the Scrub section
        in the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/WheatonCS/Lexos/tree/master/test/test_suite/Scrub/Stopwords-and-Keepwords">
        <u>Lexos test suite</u></a>.</em></b>
    </h3>

    <li><b>Lemmas</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Replaces all instances of terms in a list with a common replacement
        term called a "lemma". Lemmas might be conceived of as dictionary
        headwords. Using the lemmas option will allow you to count a lemma and
        all of its variants (such grammatically inflected forms) as a single term.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        For example, in Old English, the word for "king", <em>cyning</em> may
        occur as <em>cyninges</em> or <em>cyningas</em>, amongst other variants.
        If each of these forms occurs one time in a text, the Lemmas function
        will instruct Lexos to treat this as three occurrences of the type
        <em>cyning</em>.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Lemmas are specified by providing a comma-separated list of variants
        followed by a colon and then the lemma. Multiple lemmas can be specified
        in separate lines as shown below:
        <pre>cyninges, cyningas: cyning <br>Beowulfes, Beowulfe: Beowulf</pre>
        You can manually enter a list of lemmas or upload your own.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Consolidations</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Replaces a list of characters with a different character. This is
        typically to consolidate symbols considered equivalent.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        For example, in Old English, the character "eth" ð  is interchangeable
        with the character "thorn" þ. The Consolidations option allows you to
        choose to merge the two using a single character.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Consolidations should be entered in the format: <pre>ð: þ</pre> Where you wish to
        change all occurrences of <code>ð</code> to <code>þ</code> . Multiple
        consolidations can be separated by commas or line breaks.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Consolidations can be entered manually in the provided form field or
        uploaded from a file. Note that the "Make Lowercase" option will be applied
        to your list of characters if that option is also selected. To replace
        entire words (terms) with other words, you should use the <b>Lemma</b> option.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Special Characters</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Replaces character entities with their glyph equivalents.
        For instance, in HTML, the Old English character &ldquo;ash&rdquo; (æ)
        is represented with the entity <code>&amp;aelig;</code>. Since Lexos
        works entirely with Unicode characters you will most likely want to
        replace character entities with their Unicode equivalents prior to
        further analysis using the "Special Characters" tool. Lexos provides
        four rule sets of pre-defined entities and their corresponding glyphs:
        <ul class="help-section-list">
            <li>Early English HTML: Transforms a variety of HTML entities used
                to encode Old English, Middle English, and Early Modern English
                into their corresponding glyphs.</li>
            <li>Old English SGML: Transforms SGML entities used by the
                <em>Dictionary of Old English</em> into their corresponding
                glyphs.</li>
            <li>MUFI 3: Transforms entities specified in version 3.0 of the
                Medieval Unicode Font Initiative (MUFI 3) to their corresponding
                glyphs.</li>
            <li>MUFI 4: Transforms entities specified in version 4.0 of the
                Medieval Unicode Font Initiative (MUFI 4) to their corresponding
                glyphs.</li>
        </ul>
        You may also design your own ruleset if you are not using a language
        covered by one of the pre-defined rule sets. To do this, enter your
        transformation rules in the provided form field or upload a file. The
        entity should be separated from its replacement glyph by a comma.
        <pre>&amp;aelig;,æ</pre>
        Multiple transformation rules should be listed on separate lines.
    </h3>
</ul>

<!-- Replacing Patterns -->
<h3 class="help-section-title">Replacing Patterns</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Sometimes it is necessary to replace a pattern rather than a precise string.
    For instance, if a document contains multiple URLs like
    <code>http://lexos.wheatoncollege.edu</code> and
    <code>http://scalar.usc.edu/works/lexos/</code>, and you need to strip
    these URLs, a method is required for matching all URLs without knowing
    what they are in advance. One technique is to apply regular expression
    (regex) pattern matching. Lexos uses regular expressions internally to
    perform some of its scrubbing options, but, as of version 3.0, it does
    not provide a way for users to supply their own regular expression
    patterns when scrubbing. If users need to strip or replace patterns by
    regular expressions, it will be necessary to perform that action using
    a separate script or tool <em><u>prior to using Lexos</u></em>. A useful
    regular expressions tutorial can be found at
    <a target="_blank" href="https://regexone.com/"><u>RegexOne</u></a>.
    Most modern text editors like
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sublimetext.com/"><u>Sublime Text</u></a> and
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.barebones.com/products/TextWrangler/"><u>TextWrangler</u></a>
    accept regular expressions in their search and replace functions, and
    users may find them to be a convenient means of performing actions with
    regular expressions. We hope to add a regular expression pattern matching
    to Lexos in the future.
