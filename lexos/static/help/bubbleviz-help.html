<h3 class="help-section-title">The BubbleViz Tool</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    BubbleViz offers an alternative to word clouds as a method of visualizing
    the Document-Term Matrix. They present terms arranged inside circles ("bubbles")
    sized according to the terms' frequency within the text. BubbleViz graphs
    enable you to get a sense of the content in your corpus, and they are very
    good for presentations.

<!-- Usage -->
<h3 class="help-section-title">Usage</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    The BubbleViz tool will automatically create a graph with all the active
    documents. To use less or more of the documents in your corpus, visit the
    <a href="/manage"><u>Manage</u></a> tool to activate and deactivate documents.

    <li><b>Stop Words</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        By default, Lexos does not exclude any terms from the BubbleViz graph.
        But you can scrub stop words like "the", "and", "a" under the
        <a href="/scrub"><u>Scrub</u></a> tool to remove these words from your
        visualization.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Font</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        You can change the appearance of your word cloud by setting the font
        here. This feature should work with any font installed on your system.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Term Count</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        By default, Lexos includes the top 100 terms in your documents. Use
        this setting to modify the number. Limiting the number of terms may help
        you to include high frequency terms which are dropped by the layout algorithm.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Color</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        The default color scheme is Blue and Grey, but you can click here to
        select different colors for your visualization.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Download</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Word clouds are downloadable in either <code>.svg</code> or <code>.png</code>
        format. SVG images are very useful because they scale well in web browsers.
