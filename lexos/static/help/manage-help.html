<h3 class="help-section-title">The Manage Tool</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Manage is the tool you use to perform various types of "housekeeping" on
    documents in your Lexos workspace. In addition to documents derived from files
    you have uploaded, Manage will also list documents created by other tools, such
    as segments produced by the
    <a href="/cut"><u>Cutter</u></a> tool.

<!-- Usage -->
<h3 class="help-section-title">Usage</h3>

<ul class="help-section-list" style="list-style-type:none;">

    <li><b>Purposes</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Activate and de-activate documents in your workspace (Lexos tools only
        operate on your active documents). Delete unwanted documents from your
        workspace. Re-name documents in your workspace. Add class labels to your
        documents in your workspace (e.g. apply an AUTHOR class label to all
        documents with the same author).
    </h3>

    <li><b>Columns in the Document Table</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Documents in your workspace are listed in the form of a table. The left-most
        column indicates what documents are active.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        The "Document" column lists the filename without the filename
        extension. The original filenames are listed in the "Source" column. If
        you use Lexos tools to create new documents based on your uploaded files
        (e.g., if you segment a document), the original filename will be displayed
        in the "Source" column, and a new name will be generated for the "Document"
        column. Document names can be changed using the context menu, as described
        below.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        By default, documents created by file upload or a Lexos tool do
        not have an associated class, so the "Class" column is empty.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        The "Excerpt" column shows a preview of the beginning of each document.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Rows in the table can be sorted by column information by clicking
        on the column header (see the arrow in the column header to indicate the
        sorting order, e.g., increasing or decreasing order).
    </h3>

</ul>

<!-- Options -->
<h3 class="help-section-title">Options</h3>

<ul class="help-section-list" style="list-style-type:none;">
    <li><b>Activating and De-activating Documents</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        By default, all documents are activated when they are uploaded. In
        subsequent analyses, only active documents are used. Return here to ensure
        all desired documents are active.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        The following methods can be
        used to manage the active state of documents:
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        <ul class="help-section-list">
            <li>
                <b>Single-Click</b>: This will activate the document selected
                and toggle the state of the row clicked. If the document is
                active, it will be deactivated.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Drag-Click</b>: Clicking on a row with the mouse button held
                down will activate (or de-activate if the documents are already active)
                all rows between the row clicked and the row the mouse cursor is over when
                the mouse button is released.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Right-Click</b>: This will open the context menu. See
                <em><u>Using the Context Menu</u></em> below.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </h3>

    <li><b>Deleting Documents</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Deleting individual documents from the workspace is probably achieved
        most easily achieved using the Context Menu as described below. However,
        if you wish to delete all your documents and re-start your workflow, use
        the "Reset" button in the top right to delete all documents and begin
        from the Upload page.
    </h3>

</ul>

<!-- Using the context menu -->
<h3 class="help-section-title">Using the Context Menu</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Right-clicking on a table cell or row will open the context menu. It has the
    following options:
</h3>

<ul class="help-section-list" style="list-style-type: none">

    <li><b>Preview Document</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        This will open a dialog containing the entire text of your document
        (without formatting or white spaces). Note that longer documents can
        take a while to load, so please be patient.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Edit Name</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        This function allows you to create a new name for the document in the
        row you have clicked. To change the name, enter your new name in the
        dialogue form field and click "Ok".
    </h3>

    <li><b>Edit Class</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        This function allows you to create a class label for the single document
        in the row you have clicked. Enter the label you wish to identify with
        the class in the dialogue form field and click "Ok". See the section on
        <u><em>Classifying Documents</em></u> below.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Delete</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        This function will delete the individual document in the row you have
        clicked.
    </h3>

    <!-- Merge function has yet to be implemented-->
    <li><b>Merge</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        This function will merge selected documents together. You can give the
        merged document a new name as you add it to the corpus list,
        while the un-merged documents will remain untouched. You can also add
        a milestone to mark in the text where one document ends and another begins.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Edit Active Classes</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        If you have multiple active documents, this option will allow you to apply
        a class label to all of them at once. Enter the label you wish to identify
        with the class in the dialogue form field and click "Ok". See the section
        on<u><em>Classifying Documents</em></u> below.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Delete Active</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        If you have multiple active documents, this option will allow you to
        delete them all at once.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Activate All and Deactivate All</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Activate All will activate all uploaded documents. Deactivate all will
        deactivate all uploaded documents.
    </h3>

</ul>

<!-- Classifying documents -->
<h3 class="help-section-title">Classifying Documents</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Document classes are groups of documents identified as belonging to the same
    category defined by some human-assigned criterion. For instance, a collection
    of novels might be separated into two classes based on whether they were
    published in Britain or the United States. Gender, genre,  date of authorship,
    and authorship might be used to classify documents. Lexos' class labels allow
    you to assign classes to documents and sort by class in the Manage tool.
    At present, document classes are under-utilized elsewhere in the Lexos suite;
    however,  they are an important part of the <a href="/top-words"><u>Topwords</u></a> tool.
    In general, you should assign class labels in Manage before using Topwords.
</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-title">Manage Features Outside this Page</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    By clicking the "Active Documents" text in the bottom right corner of any
    other page, you can open a pop-up window containing a smaller version of
    this page. From there, you can activate and deactivate documents, though
    you cannot use any features accessed with the right-click.
</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Note that the page will not update to reflect the changed state of your
    documents, but the document states displayed in the pop-up are correct
    and will be used when interacting with the current page.
