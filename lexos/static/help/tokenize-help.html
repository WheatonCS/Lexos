<h3 class="help-section-title">The Tokenizer Tool</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    The Tokenizer tool allows you to peek at and/or download your current
    Document-Term Matrix (DTM) according to your current tokenize, normalize,
    and culling options.
</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    Tokenizing is the backbone for many functions in Lexos.
    Tokenization is the process of dividing a string of text into countable units
    called “tokens”. Tokens are typically individual characters or words, but
    they can also be “n-grams”, units composed of one or more sequences of
    characters or words. By default, Lexos divides the text into tokens using s
    paces as token delimiters. However, it can create n-grams by tokens (e.g.
    1-gram: "the", 2-gram or bi-grams "the dog", etc.) or n-grams by character
    (e.g. 5-grams: "the d" and "he do", etc.).

<ul class="help-section-list" style="list-style-type: none">

    <li><b>What is the DTM?</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Once the text is divided into tokens, Lexos assembles a Document-Term Matrix (DTM).
        This is a table of “terms” — unique token forms — that occur in the
        active documents. Lexos calculates the number of times each document
        contains each term to produce the DTM. It displays the DTM as a table
        where you can explore the table of term counts representing your texts.
        <em><b>Note:</b> Text corpora containing a large number of documents or types
        can take a while to process, so please be patient.</em>
    </h3>

    <li><b>Using the DTM</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        By default, Lexos displays 10 table rows per page, but you can change this
        using the "Rows" radio buttons. You can also filter the rows by entering
        keywords in the "Search" form. Make sure to press "Generate" after
        changing these options to refresh the table.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        To sort the table, click on a column header, and either "Ascending" or
        "Descending" at the top next to "Order". Make sure to press "Generate" after
        changing these options to refresh the table.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Orientation</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        By default, Lexos displays the DTM with documents listed in columns and
        terms listed in rows. When downloading the DTM you may choose to transpose
        the table by selecting the Documents as Rows, Terms as Columns option. It
        is most likely the case that you will have relatively few documents and a
        relatively large number of terms. <em><b>Note:</b> Transposing the matrix
        will produce a table with potentially hundreds or thousands of columns,
        requiring you to scroll horizontally to view them.</em>
    </h3>

</ul>

<!-- Options -->
<h3 class="help-section-title">Options</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    If you change the settings on any of the following options, make sure
    to click "Generate" to see your changes reflected in the DTM.
</h3>

<ul class="help-section-list" style="list-style-type: none">

    <li><b>Tokenize</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        By default Lexos tokenizes by tokens, meaning it splits strings of text
        into tokens every time it encounters a space character. For Western languages,
        this means that each token generally corresponds to a word. To tokenize
        by multiple words, you can increase the n-gram size.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        For example given the text: "the dog ran" tokenizing by 1-gram tokens
        would produce tokens "the", "dog", "ran". Tokenizing by 2-grams would
        count the instances of bi-grams or pairs of words, thus producing tokens
        "the dog", "dog ran", and so on.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        If you wish to tokenize by characters, Lexos will treat every character
        (letters, whitespace, punctuation, etc.) as a separate token. Tokenizing
        by 2-gram characters would produce tokens "th","he","e ", and so on.
        Tokenizing by characters is best used for non-western languages that don't
        have whitespace between tokens such as classical Chinese.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Normalize</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        The default "Normalize" setting is "Proportional" which displays the
        frequency of the occurrence of terms in your documents as a proportion
        of the entire text.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        "Raw Counts" will display in the table the actual number of occurrences
        of each term in each document.
    </h3>
        <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        "TF-IDF" or Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency attempts to
        take into account difference in the lengths of your documents by
        calculating their TF-IDF. Lexos uses base<em>e</em> (natural log) as the
        default.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Cull</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        "Culling" is a generic term we use for methods of decreasing the number
        of terms used to generate the DTM based on statistical criteria (as
        opposed to something like applying a stop-word list in Scrubber). Culling
        is optional to use in Lexos. Lexos offers two different methods:
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        "Use the top ___ words": This method takes a slice of the DTM
        containing only the top N most frequently occurring terms in the
        set of active documents. The default setting is 100, meaning
        Tokenizer will generate the DTM using only the top 100 most
        frequent terms.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        "Must be in ___ documents": This method build the DTM using only
        terms that occur in at least N documents. The default setting is
        1. If you have 10 active documents and you want to generate the
        DTM using only terms that appear in all your active documents,
        set the value to 10. <em><b>Note:</b> You can quickly determine
        the number of active documents in your workspace as indicated by
        the counter in the bottom right corner.</em>
    </h3>

    <li><b>Download</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        To download the DTM click the "Download" button and you will get a
        results <code>.csv</code> file. “CSV” is short for Comma-Separated Values.
        In your downloaded file, a comma will serve as the column delimiter and
        these files can be opened by other programs later, e.g., Excel.
