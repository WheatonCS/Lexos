<h3 class="help-section-title">The Cut Tool</h3>

<h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
    The Lexos Cutter tool allows you to divide your texts into multiple segments.
    Each segment is treated by Lexos exactly like any other document. You can
    perform individual scrubbing actions, create word clouds of segments, and
    cluster the segments of documents just as you would any other text.

<h3 class="help-section-title">Usage</h3>

<ul class="help-section-list" style="list-style-type: none">

    <li><b>Preview and Apply</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        Once you have selected the cutting options you desire, click the "Preview"
        button to see the results in the preview window. If you are happy with
        the cuts performed by Lexos, click the "Apply" button. This will create
        new documents with the same name as the original followed by a number
        for each segment. Each segment will appear as a new document in the
        <a href="/manage"><u>Manage</u></a> tool. Once cutting is applied, the
        original document is de-activated and the new segments are made active documents.

    <li><b>Download</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        You can download the new document segments by clicking the "Download"
        button. This is handy when you want to work with your segmented documents
        again but you want to begin by uploading your previous segmented documents,
        thus allowing you to skip the cutting step.

<!-- Options -->
<h3 class="help-section-title">Options</h3>

<ul class="help-section-list" style="list-style-type: none">

    <li><b>Tokens</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        This option allows you to designate the number of tokens you wish to be
        included in each segment.
        <ul class="help-section-list">
            <li>"Segment Size" refers to the number of 1-gram "word" tokens you
                wish to include in each segment (e.g. segment size = 100 will cut
                the document into segments with 100 words each). The cutter tool
                treats space-separated strings of characters as tokens.</li>
            <li>"Overlap" allows you to specify an area of overlap between each
                segment (e.g. segment size 100 and overlap of 10, segment 1 will
                end at word #100 and segment 2 will start at #90).</li>
            <li>"Merge Threshold" handles the situation where the final segment
                does not reach the number of tokens in the designated segment size.
                The default setting is if the final segment is 50% or more of
                the length of the designated segment size. If the final segment
                is too small, the entire final segment will be attached to the
                previous one.</li>
        </ul>
    </h3>

    <li><b>Characters</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        This option allows you to designate the number of characters you wish
        to be included in each segment. The other options function the same as
        in the "Tokens" cutting mode, but using characters as the unit.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Lines</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        If your document contains line breaks, this option allows you to designate
        the number of lines is contained in each segment. "Segment Size" refers
        to the number of lines after which Lexos will perform a cut. All other
        options function the same as in the "Tokens" cutting mode, but using
        lines as the unit.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Segments</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        This option allows you to designate the number of evenly-sized segments
        each document should be cut into, regardless of the length of the document.
    </h3>

    <li><b>Milestones</b></li>
    <h3 class="help-section-paragraph">
        This option allows you to use a text string that occurs multiple times
        throughout the document as a delimiter between segments. Lexos will perform
        a cut every time it encounters this term. <em>Note:</em> you must be careful
        that your milestone term only occurs where you wish to cut your document,
        and nowhere else as a part of the text of your document. For example,
        the term "Chapter" could be used as a milestone term to cut the document
        into individual chapters.
