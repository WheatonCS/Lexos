At London in Englonde no&ezh;t fulle longe sy&thorn;en 
sy&thorn;en kryst suffred on crosse and Cristendome stabled,
Ther was a byschop in &thorn;at burghe, blessyd and sakred;
Saynt Ernenwolde as I hope &thorn;at holy mon hatte.
In his tyme in &thorn;at toun &thorn;e temple al&thorn;er grattest
Was drawen doun, &thorn;at one dole, to dedifie nwe,
For hit hethen had bene in Hengyst dawes

And pervertyd alle &thorn;e peple &thorn;at in &thorn;at place dwellide.
&thorn;en wos this reme renayed mony ronk &ezh;eres,
Til Saynt Austyn into Sandewiche as send fro &thorn;e pope.
&thorn;en prechyd he here &thorn;e pure faythe and planted &thorn;e trawthe,
And convertyd all &thorn;e communnates to Cristendame newe.
He turned temples &thorn;at tyme &thorn;at temyd to &thorn;e develle,
And Clansyd hom in Cristes nome and kyrkes hom called;
He hurled out hor ydols and hade hym in saynte&ezh;, 
And chaunged chevely hor name&ezh; and chaunged hom better;
&thorn;at er was of Appolyn is now Saynt Peter,
Mahoun to Saynt Margrete o&thorn;er to Maudelayne,
&thorn;e Synagoge of &thorn;e sunne was sett to oure Lady,
Jubiter and Jono to Jesu o&thorn;er to James.
So he hom dedifiet and dy&ezh;t all to dere halowe&ezh;

	Now &thorn;at London is nevenyd hatte &thorn;e nwe troye,

And &thorn;e tytle of &thorn;e temple bitan was his name,
For he was dry&ezh;ten derrest of ydols praysed
And &thorn;e solempnest of his sacrifices in Saxon londes. 
&thorn;e thrid temple hit wos tolde of Triapolitanes:
By alle Bretaynes bonke&ezh; were bot othire tweyne.
Now of &thorn;is Augustynes art is Erkenwolde bischop
At luf London toun and the lawe teche&ezh;,
Syttes semly in &thorn;e sege of Saynt poule mynster

A noble note for &thorn;e none&ezh; and nwe Werke hit hatte.
Mony a myry mason was made &thorn;er to wyrke,
Harde stones for to hewe with eggit toles,
Mony grubber in grete &thorn;e grounde for to seche

And as &thorn;ai makkyde and mynyde a meruayle &thorn;ai founden
As &ezh;et in crafty cronecles is kydde &thorn;e memorie,
For as &thorn;ai dy&ezh;t and dalfe so depe into &thorn;e erthe

Hit was a throghe of thykke ston &thorn;ryuandely hewen,
With gargeles garnyst aboute alle of gray marbre.
The sperle of &thorn;e spelunke &thorn;at spradde hit alofte

And &thorn;e bordure enbelicit with bry&ezh;t golde lettres;

And mony a mesters mon of manners dyverse;

&thorn;er commen pider of all kynnes so kenely mony
&thorn;at as alle &thorn;e worlde were &thorn;ider walon within a hondewhyle.
Quen &thorn;e maire with his meyny &thorn;at meruayle asspyed,

And were &thorn;e lydde neuer so large &thorn;ai layde hit by sone.
But &thorn;en wos wonder to wale on wy&ezh;e&ezh; &thorn;at standen
That my&ezh;t not com to to knowe a koyntyse strange
So was &thorn;e glode within gay, al with golde paynted,
And a blyssfull body opon &thorn;e bothem lyggid,

Al with glysnande golde his goune wos hemmyd,
With mony a precious perle py&ezh;t &thorn;eron,
And a gordel of golde bigripid his mydelle;
A much mantyle on lofte with menyver furred,

And on his coyfe wos kest a coron ful ryche
And a semly septure sett in his honde.
Als wemle&ezh; were his wedes withouten any teche

And als bry&ezh;t of hor ble in blysnande hewes

And als freshe hym &thorn;e face and the flesch naked
Bi his eres and bi his hondes &thorn;at openly schewed

	&thorn;e bodeworde to &thorn;e byschop was bro&ezh;t on a quyle
Of &thorn;at buriede body al &thorn;e bolde wonder.
&thorn;e prymate with his prelacie was parted fro home,

And suche a cry aboute a cors crakit euer more;

'Thurghe his deere debonerte digne hit my Lorde:

And so longe he gret after grace &thorn;at he graunte hade,

Of Spiritus Domini for his spede on sotyle wyse,
With queme questis of &thorn;e quere with ful quaynt notes.
